We introduce a concept solution at J, which is compared with that proposed in [ 14]. Finally we study the Cauchy problem and, in the special case of n <= 2 and m <= 2, we prove existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem, via the wave-front tracking method.

J	Liang, ZL; Wakahara, Y				Liang, Zilu; Wakahara, Yasushi			Real-time urban traffic amount prediction models for dynamic route guidance systems	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Urban traffic prediction; Route guidance system; Intelligent transport system; Traffic modelling	TRAVEL-TIME; FLOW	The route guidance system (RGS) has been considered an important technology to mitigate urban traffic congestion. However, existing RGSs provide only route guidance after congestion happens. This reactive strategy imposes a strong limitation on the potential contribution of current RGS to the performance improvement of a traffic network. Thus, a proactive RGS based on congestion prediction is considered essential to improve the effectiveness of RGS. The problem of congestion prediction is translated into traffic amount (i.e. the number of vehicles on the individual roads) prediction, as the latter is a straightforward indicator of the former. We thereby propose two urban traffic prediction models using different modeling approaches. Model-1 is based on the traffic flow propagation in the network, while Model-2 is based on the time-varied spare flow capacity on the concerned road links. These two models are then applied to construct a centralized proactive RGS. Evaluation results show that (1) both of the proposed models reduce the prediction error up to 52% and 30% in the best cases compared to the existing Shift Model, (2) providing proactive route guidance helps reduce average travel time by up to 70% compared to providing reactive one and (3) non-rerouted vehicles could benefit more from route guidance than rerouted vehicles do.

A question is whether delays during the arrival phase of a flight can be absorbed more fuel-efficiently in the future. In this context, we analyze Japan's flow strategy empirically and use queueing techniques in order to gain insight into the generation of the observed delays. Based on this, we derive a rule to balance congestion delays more efficiently between ground and en-route. Whether fuel efficiency can be further improved or not will depend on the willingness to review the concept of runway pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study investigated the association between exposure to different frequency components of road traffic noise and the prevalence of hypertension in central Taiwan. Methods: We recruited 820 residents living near main roads for more than 3 years. Frequency components of traffic noise and traffic flow rates during 0900-1700 on weekdays were measured simultaneously in 2008. Multiple logistic regressions were conducted to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for diagnosed hypertension, adjusting for potential confounders and the total traffic flow rate. Results: The high-exposure group (>= the median of noise levels [decibels, dB]) at 63 Hz, 125 Hz and 1000 Hz had ORs for hypertension of 2.77 (95% confidence interval [Cl]: 1.17-6.52), 4.08 (95% CI: 1.57-10.63) and 1.98 (1.00-3.92) (95% CI: 1.00-3.92), respectively, compared to the low-exposure group (< the median of noise levels [dB]). There was an increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension by exposure to road traffic noise at 63, 125 and 1000 Hz in all subjects and in men. Total subjects exposed to >= 51 dB at 125 Hz had an OR of 4.65 (95% CI = 1.46-14.83) compared to those exposed to < 47 dB. Conclusions: With the possible bias of exposure misclassification and a bias from using diagnosed hypertension, these results suggest that exposure to road traffic noise at low and hearing-sensitive frequencies may be associated with hypertension and exposure to noise at 125 Hz may have the greatest risk for hypertension.

Boundary conditions for first order macroscopic models of vehicular traffic in the presence of tollgates	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Traffic flow; Macro-models; Nonlinearity; Flow dynamics	MASS CONSERVATION EQUATION; LATTICE MODEL; MATHEMATICAL-THEORY; FLOW; CLOSURE	This paper presents a new approach to the modeling of boundary conditions for first order models of vehicular traffic in highways. The first step consists in deriving a model for the dynamics of the flow of vehicles. Simulations of the parameters lead to a detailed analysis of the qualitative properties of the model. Subsequently, for such model, the statement of initial-boundary value problems is deduced, with domain decomposition, for a tract of highway between tollgates. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Schreckenberg, M				Kerner, Boris S.; Klenov, Sergey L.; Schreckenberg, Michael			Probabilistic physical characteristics of phase transitions at highway bottlenecks: Incommensurability of three-phase and two-phase traffic-flow theories	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; WIDE MOVING JAM; SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; FUNDAMENTAL-DIAGRAM; TRANSMISSION MODEL; EMPIRICAL-TEST; VEHICLE DATA; ON-RAMP; STATES	Physical features of induced phase transitions in a metastable free flow at an on-ramp bottleneck in three-phase and two-phase cellular automaton (CA) traffic-flow models have been revealed. It turns out that at given flow rates at the bottleneck, to induce a moving jam (F -> J transition) in the metastable free flow through the application of a time-limited on-ramp inflow impulse, in both two-phase and three-phase CA models the same critical amplitude of the impulse is required. If a smaller impulse than this critical one is applied, neither F -> J transition nor other phase transitions can occur in the two-phase CA model. We have found that in contrast with the two-phase CA model, in the three-phase CA model, if the same smaller impulse is applied, then a phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow (F -> S transition) can be induced at the bottleneck. This explains why rather than the F -> J transition, in the three-phase theory traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is governed by an F -> S transition, as observed in real measured traffic data. None of two-phase traffic-flow theories incorporates an F -> S transition in a metastable free flow at the bottleneck that is the main feature of the three-phase theory. On the one hand, this shows the incommensurability of three-phase and two-phase traffic-flow theories. On the other hand, this clarifies why none of the two-phase traffic-flow theories can explain the set of fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at highway bottlenecks.

J	Zhang, X; Chang, GL				Zhang, Xin; Chang, Gang-Len			A mixed-flow simulation model for congested intersections with high pedestrian-vehicle traffic flows	SIMULATION-TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY FOR MODELING AND SIMULATION INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Mixed flow; pedestrian; simulation; calibration; signal control; traffic conflict	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; MICRO-SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIORS	In design of plans for major metropolitan areas, it should be recognized that a potentially large percentage of the population is walking instead of driving. The massive number of pedestrians may cause tremendous burden to vehicles in the roadway network, and thus should be adequately accommodated. However, limited research has been done to qualitatively evaluate the effectiveness of different control plans at such mixed-flow intersections. Hence, the development of a simulation tool, capable of replicating the realistic road conditions for both the pedestrian and vehicle flows, is an imperative task. Such a simulation tool should be able to account for conflicts between pedestrians, between vehicles, and between pedestrians and vehicles. In this study, we attempt to address this vital subject with the mixed-cellular automata (MCA) method. Our proposed simulation model has integrated the strengths of the CA method with some probabilistic functions, offering a realistic mechanism to reflect the competing and conflict interactions between vehicle and pedestrian flows. To ensure the proposed model's applicability, this study has used field data to demonstrate the parameter calibration process and examples of some applications. Our extensive experimental results clearly indicate that the simulation model could realistically capture the behaviors and characteristics of mixed flows, offering an effective tool for potential real-world applications.

J	Larraga, ME; Alvarez-Icaza, L				Elena Larraga, Maria; Alvarez-Icaza, Luis			Cellular automata model for traffic flow with safe driving conditions	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						traffic flow models; synchronized traffic; cellular automata; platoons formation	METASTABLE STATES; WAVES	In this paper, a recently introduced cellular automata (CA) model is used for a statistical analysis of the inner microscopic structure of synchronized traffic flow. The analysis focuses on the formation and dissolution of clusters or platoons of vehicles, as the mechanism that causes the presence of this synchronized traffic state with a high flow. This platoon formation is one of the most interesting phenomena observed in traffic flows and plays an important role both in manual and automated highway systems (AHS). Simulation results, obtained from a single-lane system under periodic boundary conditions indicate that in the density region where the synchronized state is observed, most vehicles travel together in platoons with approximately the same speed and small spatial distances. The examination of velocity variations and individual vehicle gaps shows that the flow corresponding to the synchronized state is stable, safe and highly correlated. Moreover, results indicate that the observed platoon formation in real traffic is reproduced in simulations by the relation between vehicle headway and velocity that is embedded in the dynamics definition of the CA model.

An evolutionary game with a cooperative willingness profile is introduced to deal with conflicts between disturbing neighbors. Simulation results suggest that imitating cooperative willingness can ease the effect of premature seizure on traffic flow due to the introduction of evolutionary games. Phase diagrams with a strategy profile and cooperative willingness profile have been investigated in detail. Our findings also prove that by imitating the more successful, cooperative willingness instead of simply the more successful strategies, the evolution of cooperation is significantly promoted, hence improving the order of cooperation and relieving the pressure of traffic networks.

To provide anticipatory traveller information consistent with drivers' en-route diversion behaviour and controller's objectives effectively, this study examines (i) automated calibration of the parameters of a time-variant drivers' en-route diversion model using aggregate-level data, and (ii) an active route guidance scheme, which projects the network states into the near future and determines spatiotemporal coordinated anticipatory traveller information. The proposed system is tested on real world networks. The implementation results demonstrate that the anticipatory traveller information provided by the proposed model is more consistent, and therefore easier to be accepted by drivers. The findings also reveal that the coordinated VMS-based anticipatory traveller information effectively provides guidance to drivers because it accounts for the spatial and temporal changes in traffic conditions, and encourages better use of roadway capacity, thereby resulting in better system performance over the same period of operations.

The capability of state space reconstruction makes them popular in traffic prediction and estimation. In this study, to overcome the linearity assumption of these methods, a non-linear kernel-based stochastic time series method with state space reconstruction capability is proposed. To minimise the prediction error of the method, adaptive time variant transformation from primary space to reproducing kernel Hilbert space is proposed by employing extended Kalman filter. Owing to high costs of traffic detectors, not all the metropolitan areas are equipped with these sensors; therefore in this study, an extended Kalman observer based on the new dynamic-adaptive-non-linear predictor is designed and applied for traffic flow estimation and prediction in the areas that suffer from lack of detectors. Practical data simulations and evaluations justify the high strength and accuracy of the proposed method in prediction of traffic speed with incomplete data sources.

J	Zhang, GH; Wang, YH				Zhang, Guohui; Wang, Yinhai			A Gaussian Kernel-Based Approach for Modeling Vehicle Headway Distributions	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						nonparametric models; headway distribution; Gaussian kernel functions; traffic flow		Headway distribution models are essential for studying traffic flow theory, roadway accidents, and microscopic traffic simulations. Previous work has focused on parametric models. Vehicle headways were considered to follow some known parametric distributions based on certain assumptions. However, these assumptions are not universally acceptable and, consequently, the reliability of those headway distribution models varies significantly when applied to different flow conditions. In this study, a nonparametric distribution model with Gaussian kernel functions is introduced and assessed for vehicle headways on urban multilane freeways. Without any assumptions, Gaussian kernel models can extract intrinsic patterns from observed headway data to describe the distributing attributes of headways. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of Gaussian kernel models for modeling vehicle headways. Results from the experiments indicated that the proposed models outperformed traditional parametric methods in a wide range of flow rates. Furthermore, transferability tests of the nonparametric model were performed, and the results showed that the proposed models can be generalized for applications at other locations with similar traffic flow patterns.

This is shown for white noise initial density with deterministic and stochastic fundamental diagram in the case of Riemann problems and the bottleneck problem. It is also found that the stochastic solution (i) preserves the structure of the deterministic solution and (ii) tends to the deterministic solution with time at a given location.

This paper presents a hybrid macroscopic and microscopic (macromicroscopic) traffic model by extending Daganzo's Cell Transmission Model (CTM) with the real time speed dynamic. A simple supplying and demanding function is defined to represent the traffic propagation between the adjacent cell boundaries, and the car-following model is integrated to specify the dynamics of average speed in each cell. Simulation results with data set collected from a 4-kilometre long urban freeway show the performance of the model compared to the METANET model.

Using high-resolution event-based data for traffic modeling and control: An overview	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						High-resolution data; Event-based data; Traffic modeling; Traffic control; Traffic signal systems	SINGLE-LOOP DETECTORS; REAL-TIME; VEHICLE REIDENTIFICATION; EMPIRICAL-ANALYSIS; KINEMATIC WAVES; CONTROL-SYSTEM; ARCHITECTURE; ALGORITHMS; OPTIMIZATION; MANAGEMENT	Research on using high-resolution event-based data for traffic modeling and control is still at early stage. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview on what has been achieved and also think ahead on what can be achieved in the future. It is our opinion that using high-resolution event data, instead of conventional aggregate data, could bring significant improvements to current research and practices in traffic engineering. Event data records the times when a vehicle arrives at and departs from a vehicle detector. From that, individual vehicle's on-detector-time and time gap between two consecutive vehicles can be derived. Such detailed information is of great importance for traffic modeling and control. As reviewed in this paper, current research has demonstrated that event data are extremely helpful in the fields of detector error diagnosis, vehicle classification, freeway travel time estimation, arterial performance measure, signal control optimization, traffic safety, traffic flow theory, and environmental studies. In addition, the cost of event data collection is low compared to other data collection techniques since event data can be directly collected from existing controller cabinet without any changes on the infrastructure, and can be continuously collected in 24/7 mode. This brings many research opportunities as suggested in the paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A simulation approach to study emergency response	JOURNAL OF SIMULATION			English	Article						simulation; emergency response; transportation; data fusion; alternate routes; shortest path	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL	Simulation provides a significant tool in studying transportation systems and emergency response, allowing various scenarios of the 'smart environments' to be tested before real-world implementation. The simulation environment built in this paper uses Rockwell ARENA simulation software to provide a test bed for studying emergency response in a transportation network. With the data sources and assumptions used in building a roadway network with realistic traffic flow, accounting for both weather and congestion, a small study area in Western New York (WNY) provides the test bed based on real-life observations. After generating the expected movement of traffic, vehicular crashes are simulated, followed by Emergency Medical Service response. This paper focuses on the development process for building a simulation capable of modelling vehicular movement throughout a study area and a validation of the emergency vehicle travel times through historical crash response data in an existing traffic network. Its goal is to provide the basis of future work, enabling advanced transportation systems to be evaluated with respect to increased situation awareness resulting from optimized sensor placement, data fusion techniques and improved emergency response.

J	Jiang, R; Hu, MB; Jia, B; Gao, ZY				Jiang, Rui; Hu, Mao-Bin; Jia, Bin; Gao, Zi-You			A new mechanism for metastability of under-saturated traffic responsible for time-delayed traffic breakdown at the signal	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Traffic breakdown; Queue; Traffic light	SELF-ORGANIZATION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOW; FEATURES; HIGHWAY; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS; MODELS; WAVES; LIGHT	In this paper we introduce a new mechanism of metastability of under-saturated traffic at the signal that is responsible for a time-delayed traffic breakdown revealed by Kerner (2011). In our model, we assume that the metastability of under-saturated traffic at the signal is caused by a dependence of the mean time of driver acceleration from a queue at the signal on the driver's stopped time within the queue. With the use of Nagel Schreckenberg model, we demonstrate that this mechanism of the metastability of city traffic can lead to the time-delayed traffic breakdown at the signal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, J; Pang, MB; Yang, M				Chen Jing; Pang Ming-Bao; Yang Min			A cellular automaton model for the road in front of elementary and middle school gates during students going to school	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						cellular automaton model (CAM); intelligent transportation system (ITS); arrival of elementary and middle school; mixed traffic flow	SYSTEM	Based on the studies on traffic bottleneck of road, interference area, and mixed traffic flow, a cellular automaton model for the roads in front of elementary and middle school gates during students going to school is established. Characteristics of traffic flow are discussed via the simulation experiment. Effects of the traffic flow and the traffic volume are analyzed including the proportion of student driving private cars, the proportion of school buses, and the command giving by traffic policeman on the scene. Results of examples given in this paper show that traffic safety can be ensured, the traffic jams can be suppressed, and the goal of achieving largest traffic flow and decreasing the passing time of vehicles can be realized by decreasing the proportion of student driving private cars, increasing the proportion of school buses, and assisting the traffic policeman to command on the scene.

This traffic control model needs to have enough descriptive power to reproduce relevant traffic phenomena, and it also has to be fast enough to be used in practice. Consequently, macroscopic urban traffic flow models are usually applied as control models. In this study, a macroscopic spatiotemporally discrete urban traffic model with a variable sampling time interval is proposed for model-based control strategies. By selecting proper sampling time intervals and sampling space distances, it allows us to balance modelling accuracy and computational complexity of the spatiotemporally discrete model. In addition, an urban traffic Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition is deduced for spatiotemporally discrete urban traffic models, which is a sufficient condition to guarantee the discrete model to bear enough descriptive modelling power to reproduce necessary traffic phenomena. The model is analysed and evaluated based on the model requirements for control purposes. The simulation results are compared for the situations where the CFL condition is violated and not violated.

Modeling Seasonal Heteroscedasticity in Vehicular Traffic Condition Series Using a Seasonal Adjustment Approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Seasonal effect; Heteroscedasticity modeling; Short-term traffic condition forecasting; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH); Time series analysis; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA)	STATISTICAL-MODEL; VOLATILITY; FLOW	Heteroscedasticity modeling in transportation engineering is primarily conducted in short-term traffic condition forecasting to generate time varying prediction intervals around the point forecasts through quantitatively predicting the conditional variance of traffic condition series. Until recently, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model and the stochastic volatility model have been two major approaches adopted from the field of financial time series analysis for traffic heteroscedasticity modeling. In this paper, recognizing the pronounced seasonal pattern in traffic condition data, a simple seasonal adjustment approach is explored for modeling seasonal heteroscedasticity in traffic-flow series, and four types of seasonal adjustment factors are proposed with respect to daily or weekly patterns. Using real-world traffic-flow data collected from highway systems in the United Kingdom and the United States, the proposed seasonal adjustment approach is implemented and validated. Empirical results show that the proposed model can effectively capture and hence model the seasonal heteroscedasticity in traffic-flow series. In addition, through a comparison with the conventional GARCH model, the proposed approach is shown to consistently generate improved performances in terms of prediction interval construction. Potential applications are discussed to explore the value of heteroscedasticity modeling in transportation engineering studies.

Modelling trends in road accident frequency-Bayesian inference for rates with uncertain exposure	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; Disaggregation; Exposure; MCMC; Road accidents; Uncertainty	QUASI-INDUCED EXPOSURE	Traffic flow data are primarily used to monitor road use and to compute road accident rates in Great Britain. The main traffic flow data used for these purposes measure annual traffic flow in vehicle kilometres, however this dataset is limited in its disaggregation. In particular, it is not possible to quantify traffic flow by different types of cars using just these flow data. Two additional sources of data are introduced (the number of cars registered each year and an induced exposure dataset containing information about different road use by different car types) and a model combines the three datasets in order to produce a disaggregation of traffic flow by car type and road type on the commonly used annual traffic data. MCMC algorithms are used to simulate from the posterior distributions and produce estimates of the traffic by three road types and six car types across 12 years. These flow estimates are then used in models for accident rates. (C) 2014 Transport Research Laboratory. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effect of density difference on the stability of traffic flow is examined through linear stability analysis and shown that the density difference term can significantly enlarge the stability region on the phase diagram. To describe the phase transition of traffic flow, the Burgers equation and mKdV equation near the critical point are derived through nonlinear analysis. To verify the theoretical findings, numerical simulation is conducted which confirms that traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the density difference effect in the modified lattice model for two-lane traffic.

J	Ito, H; Nishinari, K				Ito, Hidetaka; Nishinari, Katsuhiro			Totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with a time-dependent boundary: Interaction between vehicles and pedestrians at intersections	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS	Interaction between vehicles and pedestrians is seen in many areas such as crosswalks and intersections. In this paper, we study a totally asymmetric simple exclusion process with a bottleneck at a boundary caused by an interaction. Due to the time-dependent effect originating from the speed of pedestrians, the flow of the model varies even if the average hopping probability at the last site is the same. We analyze the phenomenon by using two types of approximations: extended two-cluster approximation and isolated rarefaction wave approximation. The approximate results capture intriguing features of the model. Moreover, we discuss the situation where vehicles turn right at the intersection by adding a traffic light at the boundary condition. The result suggests that pedestrian scrambles are valid to eliminate traffic congestion in the right-turn lane.

It first confirms that the four types of vehicle headways are significantly different by performing the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests using work zone headway data from Singapore. The statistical test results further show that four factors - traffic flow rate, percentage of trucks, work intensity and lane position - have a significant impact on each type of vehicle headway in work zones. A useful methodology is thus proposed to determine the best-fitted headway distribution model for each type, which includes two procedures: determining the best distribution pattern for each type using the maximum-likelihood estimation and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test techniques and formulating the distribution model parameters as a function of the aforementioned four factors.

The model, defined in continuous time on a discrete space, follows a misanthrope Markovian process. It is a mesoscopic traffic model in the following sense: the vehicles are individually considered, but their dynamics are aggregated per section. The model parameters are supply and demand functions in equilibrium (i.e. a fundamental diagram). In order to model flows on a traffic network, different schemes of junction dynamics are proposed. The model properties in transient and stationary states are investigated analytically in simple cases and by simulation. The results show that the process presents classical properties of deterministic macroscopic model such as the propagation of shock or rarefaction wave for Riemann initial condition. On the other hand, one observes phenomena usually related to high order models, such as a wide scattering of the flow performances or the propagation (backward or forward according to the density level) of local perturbations, due to the stochasticity.

However, the traffic theories have been controversial due to a lack of precise traffic data. We have studied traffic flow from a new perspective by carrying out large-scale car-following experiment on an open road section, which overcomes the intrinsic deficiency of empirical observations. The experiment has shown clearly the nature of car-following, which runs against the traditional traffic flow theory. Simulations show that by removing the fundamental notion in the traditional car-following models and allowing the traffic state to span a two-dimensional region in velocity-spacing plane, the growth pattern of disturbances has changed qualitatively and becomes qualitatively or even quantitatively in consistent with that observed in the experiment.

The objectives are improving traffic flow and enhancing road safety. Their success is based on accurate monitoring of two key variables, specifically speed and occupancy. The latter of the two has, to date, received significantly less attention from the scientific community. In this work we present a lightweight method to perform "on-line" occupancy estimation. We first propose three occupancy measurements calculated from data collected by a floating car: vehicle count, percentage of stop time, and headway. We then extend these discrete values to a continuous estimation of occupancy in space and time. The proposed estimators are based on a pairwise linear regression of each of the previously calculated measurements over certain references obtained from other floating cars or magnetic loop detectors. The method has been calibrated and validated under real traffic conditions and data. Despite the ease of implementation, the method is able to reproduce the occupancy values generated by the actual loop detectors, achieving promising results, with estimation errors down to 6.52%, even before multivehicle systems are considered.

Macroscopic traffic flow model validation at congested freeway off-ramp areas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Macroscopic traffic flow models; Model validation; Freeway off-ramps	IDENTIFICATION; WAVES	The reported study tests, validates and compares two well-known macroscopic traffic flow models in the special, but quite frequently occurring case, where congestion is created due to saturated freeway off-ramps. In particular, the comparison includes the first-order model CTM (Cell Transmission Model) and the second-order model METANET. In order to enable a reliable and fair comparison, the traffic flow models are first calibrated by use of real traffic data from AWN Odos freeway in Athens, Greece. The resulting models are validated using various traffic data sets, different than the one used for their calibration; the models are then evaluated and compared with respect to their accuracy in the reproduction of congestion created at freeway off-ramp areas.

Accounting for dynamic speed limit control in a stochastic traffic environment: A reinforcement learning approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Dynamic speed limit control; Stochastic network; Connected vehicle; Reinforcement learning; Network loading	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; NETWORKS; HIGHWAY; DEMAND; IMPACT; COORDINATION; EQUILIBRIUM; UNCERTAINTY; PROPAGATION; FORMULATION	This paper proposes a novel dynamic speed limit control model accounting for uncertain traffic demand and supply in a stochastic traffic network. First, a link based dynamic network loading model is developed to simulate the traffic flow propagation allowing the change of speed limits. Shockwave propagation is well defined and captured by checking the difference between the queue forming end and the dissipation end. Second, the dynamic speed limit problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and solved by a real time control mechanism. The speed limit controller is modeled as an intelligent agent interacting with the stochastic network environment stochastic network environment to assign time dependent link based speed limits. Based on different metrics, e.g. total network throughput, delay time, vehicular emissions are optimized in the modeling framework, the optimal speed limit scheme is obtained by applying the R-Markov Average Reward Technique (R-MART) based reinforcement learning algorithm. A case study of the Sioux Falls network is constructed to test the performance of the model. Results show that the total travel time and emissions (in terms of CO) are reduced by around 18% and 20% compared with the base case of non-speed limit control. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	d'Orey, PM; Ferreira, M				d'Orey, Pedro M.; Ferreira, Michel			ITS for Sustainable Mobility: A Survey on Applications and Impact Assessment Tools	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Carbon dioxide (CO2); energy; environment; field operation tests; fuel; green intelligent transportation systems (ITS); simulation	VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS; EMISSION; SYSTEM; MODEL; SIMULATION; SPEED; INFORMATION; NETWORKS; ECONOMY	Road transportation is one of the main sources of greenhouse gas emissions, which lead to global warming and climate change. Promoting the decarbonization of this sector through more efficient and greener mobility is a challenging task that can be achieved by intelligent transportation systems (ITS) enabled by vehicular communications. In this paper, we briefly present how mobility players and enablers (driver, vehicle, and road network) influence energy consumption and pollutant emissions. Furthermore, this survey paper details how different ITS, ranging from eco-routing to intelligent intersection management, can lead to sustainable mobility by promoting a more efficient vehicle usage and enhanced efficiency on road network utilization. Results shown that ITS has the potential to considerably reduce fuel consumption and pollutant emissions, namely, by smoothing the traffic flow, reducing the number of start-stops, and reducing the total travel distance. In addition, we present and analyze two main methods for evaluating green transportation systems: 1) field operational tests; and 2) simulation-based evaluations. We give special emphasis to simulation-based assessment of Green ITS measures by detailing the necessary models and their interactions. Finally, we propose a number of recommendations and future research directions in the area of Green ITS.

J	Daraghmi, YA; Yi, CW; Chiang, TC				Daraghmi, Yousef-Awwad; Yi, Chih-Wei; Chiang, Tsun-Chieh			Negative Binomial Additive Models for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting in Urban Areas	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Additive models; autocorrelation; multivariate; negative binomial (NB); overdispersion; seasonal patterns; short-term forecast; spatial correlation	PREDICTION	Parallel, coordinated, and network-wide traffic management requires accurate and efficient traffic forecasting models to support online, real-time, and proactive dynamic control. Forecast accuracy is impacted by a critical characteristic of traffic flow, i.e., overdispersion. Efficiency depends on the time complexity of forecasting algorithms. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal multivariate forecasting model that is based on the negative binomial additive models (NBAMs). Negative binomial is utilized to handle overdispersion, and additive models are used to efficiently smooth nonlinear spatial and temporal variables. To evaluate the model, it is applied to real-world data collected from Taipei City and compared with other forecasting models. The results indicate that the proposed model is an accurate and efficient approach in forecasting traffic flow in urban context where flow is overdispersed, autocorrelated, and influenced by upstream and downstream roads as well as the daily seasonal patterns, namely, low-, moderate-, and high-traffic seasons.

Interaction among vehicles frequently causes congestion as well as bottlenecks in road capacity. In dense traffic, waves of traffic density propagate backward as drivers try to keep safe distances through frequent acceleration and deceleration. This paper presents a vehicle driving system in a model predictive control framework that effectively improves traffic flow. The vehicle driving system regulates safe intervehicle distance under the bounded driving torque condition by predicting the preceding traffic. It also focuses on alleviating the effect of braking on the vehicles that follow, which helps jamming waves attenuate to in the traffic. The proposed vehicle driving system has been evaluated through numerical simulation in dense traffic.	[Kamal, Md. Abdus Samad] Japan Sci & Technol Agcy, Kawaguchi, Saitama 3320012, Japan; [Kamal, Md.

To do that, an automatic approach for detecting and visualizing hidden themes and their evolution across a consecutive span of years is applied. This automatic approach, which is based on co-word analysis, combines performance analysis and science mapping. To show the conceptual evolution of ITS, three consecutive periods have been defined, i.e., 1992-2001, 2002-2006, and 2007-2011. We have identified that the ITS research has been focused on six main thematic areas, i.e., VEHICLE-AND-ROAD-TRACKING, DRIVER-BEHAVIOR-AND-SAFETY, SCENARIOS-SIMULATION, TRAFFIC-FLOW-AND-TRAFFIC-MANAGEMENT, VEHICLE-CONTROL, and VEHICLE-NAVIGATION.

The fuel economy of intersections is closely related to split and saturation, and the economical saturation is about 0.2-0.3. Fuel economy models were established with road segments and intersections as elementary units; fuel consumption and traffic flow data collected in the field were used to perform model calibration. A break with the traditional idea that route fuel economy modelling was set by general series systems was made by considering the route as a whole unit instead of using a paralleling system; another break was made to calculate the weighted average fuel economy of origin-destination pairs. On the basis of origin-destination fuel economy, the road network fuel economy model was set up. Ultimately, a partial road network was selected for analysis of the network fuel economy and to verify the correctness and reasonableness of the models.

The maximum flow allowed from the onramp during ramp-metering is typically estimated so that the sum of flows from the onramp and mainline do not exceed a predetermined threshold (either the capacity of the downstream section or a threshold based on occupancy at capacity). Recent research has shown that this threshold is probabilistic and the transition from noncongested to congested conditions (i.e.,breakdown) occurs stochastically. Also, research has shown that the contribution of the ramp and freeway demands on breakdown is different; 100 additional vehicles arriving from the ramp increase the probability of breakdown more than 100 additional vehicles from the freeway. This fluctuation has been studied through the development of breakdown probability models, which provide the probability of breakdown as a function of the combination of the mainline and ramp flows. The writers' objective was to develop suitable site-specific probability of breakdown models and use them within existing ramp-metering algorithms to evaluate their ability to postpone the breakdown and reduce congestion at freeway facilities with recurring congestion. The writers first develop a process for obtaining breakdown-probability models for existing critical ramps (i.e.,those where breakdown starts). Next, the writers propose specific enhancements to existing ramp-metering algorithms that incorporate probability-of-breakdown models. Proposed enhancements are presented for two algorithms, as follows: (1)the Minnesota stratified ramp-metering algorithm (SZM), and (2)the Ontario COMPASS algorithm. Simulation was used to replicate these algorithms and evaluate the proposed enhancements. The results of these experiments showed that the enhancements are effective in postponing congestion at the two sites by 17-35min.

J	Jin, CJ; Wang, W; Jiang, R; Wang, H				Jin, Cheng-Jie; Wang, Wei; Jiang, Rui; Wang, Hao			An empirical study of phase transitions from synchronized flow to jams on a single-lane highway	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article						three-phase traffic theory; high density synchronized flow; phase transition; single-vehicle data; non-close car-following behavior	CONGESTED TRAFFIC STATES; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; SYSTEMS; DIAGRAM; MODELS	In this paper we study empirical data for traffic flow at low velocities in single-lane traffic and compare them with those for multi-lane traffic. It is found that the traffic dynamics are quite different. When the velocities are low in multi-lane traffic, the traffic flow always becomes unstable and develops into jams. In single-lane traffic, some drivers drive in a more relaxed way and stay further back from the preceding car, as they know they cannot overtake the slow vehicle in front of them or at the front of the line. It may also be because they prefer not to follow the preceding vehicle too closely in single-lane traffic, to avoid the incessant deceleration and acceleration. This strategy is feasible because even if the space in front is large, no vehicle could 'cut in' in the single lane traffic. This phenomenon is called the 'moderating effect', and it harmonizes the traffic flow at low velocities. It is shown that the data points of synchronized flow in single-lane traffic are usually to the left and below those for multi-lane traffic in the flow-density plane. Thus, it is more difficult for the phase transition from synchronized flow to jams to occur in single-lane traffic, as pointed out in Kerner's three-phase traffic theory.

A novel macro model of traffic flow with the consideration of anticipation optimal velocity	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Anticipation effect; Numerical simulation	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; STABILITY; WAVES	In this paper, a novel macro model which can investigate wide moving jams is derived from car-following model by applying the relationship between the micro and macro variables with the consideration of anticipation optimal velocity on single lane. The theoretic analysis and numerical simulation show that the new macro model of traffic flow can correctly reproduce common evolution of shock, rarefaction wave and local cluster effect under small perturbation, which shows that the congested traffic patterns about wide moving jam propagation are in accordance with empirical results. Furthermore, the results uncover that the anticipation effect can smooth the front of the shock wave and the rarefaction wave, which means that anticipation effect hasten the diffusion process of congregate in the shock wave and dissolution in rarefaction wave. The key improvement of this new macro model over the previous ones lies in the fact that the anticipation traffic behaviors can improve the stability of traffic flow with the consideration of the proper anticipation effect.

Fractal behavior in the headway fluctuation simulated by the NaSch model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Adaptive fractal analysis; Power-law fluctuation; Stop-and-go waves; Traffic congestion	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; 1/F NOISE; TRAFFIC CONGESTION; GO WAVES; PROPAGATION; HIGHWAY; TIME; FLOW	The fractal behavior of traffic flow is studied by the adaptive fractal analysis method on the basis of the vehicle headway time series, which are obtained from the numerical simulation of the NaSch model. We find that the vehicle headway time series has a fractal behavior that is similar to the standard Brownian motion (BM) over a wide range of scales when the density is low. As the density increases well-defined sharp spectral peaks, corresponding to the stop-and-go waves, appear while the scale range showing BM-like behavior rapidly shrinks. In the high density regime, a new type of fractal behavior with long-range correlations appears, accompanying the worsening of traffic congestions. The underlying dynamics of traffic flow is analyzed, and some meaningful results are obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Zhu, H.

In this paper, we propose a new method of decreasing the average path length by adding edges. A new indicator is presented, incorporating traffic flow demand, to assess the decrease in the average path length when a new edge is added during the optimization process. With the help of the indicator, edges are selected and added into the network one by one. The new method has a relatively small time computational complexity in comparison with some traditional methods. In numerical simulations, the new method is applied to some synthetic spatially embedded networks. The result shows that the method can perform competitively in decreasing the average path length. Then, as an example of an application of this new method, it is applied to the road network of Hangzhou, China.

The existing ways for estimating the traffic state mostly show the drawbacks of large computation and hard implementations. In this paper, we propose a self-organizing way to collect traffic information through VANET communications without any aid of infrastructures. Then, a method based on fuzzy logic is presented to predict the phase of traffic flow timely. This method shows the advantages of easier implementations and less computation, and it can adapt dynamically to take more traffic factors into consideration if needed. With the knowledge of current traffic status, a new routing algorithm for vehicular communication on highways is proposed, which can be adaptive to different phases of traffic flow and guarantee reliable transmission in different environments. The simulation results show that our self-organizing proposal gains satisfactory accuracy according to the real-time identification of traffic flow, and the network performance of the adaptive routing algorithm is improved compared with traditional routing algorithms in terms of packet delivery ratio and throughput; at the same time, the end-to-end delay is still within an acceptable level.

J	Chen, WZ; Xie, ZL; Yan, BC				Chen, Weizhen; Xie, Zhenlin; Yan, Bochong			Research on the general method for extrapolating traffic load effects for highway bridges	STAHLBAU			English	Article							MATHEMATICAL-ANALYSIS; RANDOM NOISE	Accurate knowledge of real traffic load levels is one of the prerequisites for structural safety assessments, and the common method used to extrapolate load effects depends on the analysis of effect crossing rate distribution according to Rice's Theory. But as proved by the analysis made in this paper from three perspectives (theoretical basis of the method, determination of fitting starting class interval and discreteness of extrapolated effects), the method is flawed in at least three respects: obvious deviation between the presumption of Rice's Theory and the real distribution of crossing rate, narrow application range (extremely high traffic density) and unreliability in extrapolation of effects. Besides, the method only estimates the effects of the return period, without a reliability analysis of randomness in sampling and thus an effective estimation of effect range containing true values. Therefore, this paper, after analysing the relation between return period and extreme value distribution of load effects, as well as the occurrence rule for return period effects, proposes a general method for extrapolating traffic load effects on highway bridges. The general method, with the characteristic of high utilization of sample data in effect extrapolation from crossing rate distribution, is wide in its scope of application; it can be used for traffic flows with different densities and influence lines with different forms and lengths, and provides a confidence interval for estimated effect values.

This paper investigates efficiency-driven and objective-driven motives for drivers to change lanes on arterial roads. The former motive is determined by the circumstances of the surrounding traffic flow, whereas the latter depends on position. A location-dependent lane changing model is then established by weighing the two motives for lane changing. Both continuous and discrete versions of the arterial traffic model are obtained using the LWR (Lighthill-Whitham-Richards) model with the two types of lane changing. Simulations show that the proposed model can reproduce macroscopic traffic phenomena such as spillover and a decrease in the concomitant departure flow, which is the reason for capacity loss. It is concluded that 1) there exists a critical condition under which there is no capacity loss and that 2) a different flow composition could result in a different capacity loss, which varies according to the flow direction. Hence, traffic management and control should take this loss into account.

J	Zheng, J; Suzuki, K; Fujita, M				Zheng, Jian; Suzuki, Koji; Fujita, Motohiro			Predicting driver's lane-changing decisions using a neural network model	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						Traffic simulation; Lane changing; Artificial neural network; Multinomial logit model	TRAFFIC SIMULATION; BEHAVIOR; FLOW; STREETS; CORSIM	Lane changing has a significant impact on traffic flow characteristics and potentially reduces traffic safety. However, literature relating to lane changing is not comprehensive, largely owing to the inherent complexity of lane changing and a lack of large-scale data to analyze such behavior. In an effort to cope with these obstacles, this study adopts a neural network (NN) model to capture the complexity of lane changing, and large-scale trajectory data are employed for model estimation and validation. For comparison purposes, a multinomial logit (MNL) model that was frequently accepted as a framework for lane changing in previous studies is also built. Although for non-lane-changing samples, both models perform well in model estimation and validation processes, for lane-changing samples, there are significant differences in their performance. The NN model is able to correctly predict 94.58% of left lane-changing samples and 73.33% of right lane-changing samples in the model estimation process, whereas the percentage correctly predicted by the MNL model is only 13.25% and 3.33%, respectively. While the accuracy of both models noticeably drops in the model validation process, prediction results in the NN model are still acceptable. Finally, the impact of heavy vehicles on driver's lane-changing decisions is quantitatively evaluated using the sensitivity analysis of the proposed NN model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jia, DY; Lu, KJ; Wang, JP				Jia, Dongyao; Lu, Kejie; Wang, Jianping			On the network connectivity of platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Vehicular ad hoc networking (VANET); Platoon-based vehicular cyber-physical systems; Inter-platoon connectivity; Expected transmission delay	PROPAGATION SPEED; MODEL; ACCESS; IMPACT	In the past few years, vehicular ad hoc networking (VANET) has attracted significant attention and many fundamental issues have been investigated, such as network connectivity, medium access control (MAC) mechanism, routing protocol, and quality of service (QoS). Nevertheless, most related work has been based on simplified assumptions on the underlying vehicle traffic dynamics, which has a tight interaction with VANET in practice. In this paper, we try to investigate VANET performance from the vehicular cyber-physical system (VCPS) perspective. Specifically, we consider VANET connectivity of platoon-based VCPSs where all vehicles drive in platoon-based patterns, which facilitate better traffic performance as well as information services. We first propose a novel architecture for platoon-based VCPSs, then we derive the vehicle distribution under platoon-based driving patterns on a highway. Based on the results, we further investigate inter-platoon connectivity in a bi-directional highway scenario and evaluate the expected time of safety message delivery among platoons, taking into account the effects of system parameters, such as traffic flow, velocity, platoon size and transmission range. Extensive simulations are conducted which validate the accuracy of our analysis. This study will be helpful to understand the behavior of VCPSs, and will be helpful to improve vehicle platoon design and deployment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Aguilera, V; Tordeux, A				Aguilera, Vincent; Tordeux, Antoine			A new kind of fundamental diagram with an application to road traffic emission modeling	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						highway and traffic engineering; density; flow; speed	ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM	The main contribution of this paper is to show, on the basis of empirical traffic data, that the distribution of vehicle speeds on a road segment evolves with the occupancy in a simple manner. Under a critical occupancy, the distribution is unimodal, with one peak (the high mode) close to the free-flow speed. When the occupancy exceeds the critical occupancy, the distribution of speeds becomes bimodal. A second peak (the low mode) appears, at a noticeably lower speed than the high mode. Empirical speed distributions are well fitted when assuming a (appropriately scaled and translated) low temperature Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the high mode and a high-temperature distribution for the low mode. The standard fundamental diagram expresses the mean flow speed as a function of occupancy. The model proposed in this paper expresses the distribution of vehicle speeds as a function of the occupancy.

Highway capacity through vissim calibrated for mixed traffic conditions	KSCE JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						simulation; capacity; speed; VISSIM; mixed traffic		The present study demonstrates applicability of VISSIM software to determine capacity of multilane highways under mixed traffic flow conditions. Traffic flow data collected on a section of four-lane divided highway are used to develop the speed-flow curve. The same set of field data is used in VISSIM and simulated speed-flow curve is compared with field curve. It was found that VISSIM in its original form overestimates both speed and capacity of the highway. Driver behaviour parameters CC0 and CC1 are first determined for homogeneous traffic conditions having only one of the four types of vehicles in the stream and then results are aggregated to get the values of these parameters for a mixed traffic stream. Further analysis of field data with calibrated values of CC0 and CC1 indicated a good match between field and simulated capacity. The procedure is shown to work on another section of four-lane divided highway with paved shoulders, where simulated capacity was 5329 pcu/hr against the field capacity of 5277 pcu/hr.

Stackelberg Routing on Parallel Networks With Horizontal Queues	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATIC CONTROL			English	Article						Game theory; Nash equilibrium; network analysis and control; routing; Stackelberg game; transportation networks	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; ASSIGNMENT; EQUILIBRIUM; WAVES	This paper presents a game theoretic framework for studying Stackelberg routing games on parallel networks with horizontal queues, such as transportation networks. First, we introduce a new class of latency functions that models congestion due to the formation of physical queues. For this new class, some results from the classical congestion games literature (in which latency is assumed to be a non-decreasing function of the flow) do not hold. In particular, we find that there may exist multiple Nash equilibria that have different total costs. We provide a simple polynomial-time algorithm for computing the best Nash equilibrium, i.e., the one which achieves minimal total cost. Then we study the Stackelberg routing game: assuming a central authority has control over a fraction of the flow on the network (compliant flow), and that the remaining flow (non-compliant) responds selfishly, what is the best way to route the compliant flow in order to minimize the total cost? We propose a simple Stackelberg strategy, the Non-Compliant First (NCF) strategy, that can be computed in polynomial time. We show that it is optimal for this new class of latency on parallel networks. This work is applied to modeling and simulating congestion relief on transportation networks, in which a coordinator (traffic management agency) can choose to route a fraction of compliant drivers, while the rest of the drivers choose their routes selfishly.

When there is no exclusive lane for left-turn vehicles, through vehicles and left-turn vehicles have to share one lane. Under such situation usually two-phase signalization is adopted, and the conflicts between the two traffic streams need to be analyzed. We use a refined configuration for the intersection simulation: the geometry of the intersection has been considered and vehicles are assumed to move along 1/4 circle arcs. We focus on the averaged travel times on left lanes and their distributions. The diagrams of intersection approach capacities (IACs) and the corresponding phase diagrams are also presented, which depend on the approach flow rates and the percentage of left-turn vehicles. Besides, we find that the minimum green time could be determined by finding out the critical value for the travel times.

J	Manley, E; Cheng, T; Penn, A; Emmonds, A				Manley, Ed; Cheng, Tao; Penn, Alan; Emmonds, Andy			A framework for simulating large-scale complex urban traffic dynamics through hybrid agent-based modelling	COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS			English	Article						Agent-based simulation; Urban complexity; Human cognition; Collective phenomena; Traffic flow; Hybrid simulation	HIERARCHIES; NETWORKS; SCENARIO; BEHAVIOR; WAVES; SPACE; TIME	Urban road traffic dynamics are the product of the behaviours and interactions of thousands, often millions of individuals. Traditionally, models of these phenomena have incorporated simplistic representations of individual behaviour, ensuring the maximisation of simulation scale under given computational constraints. Yet, by simplifying representations of behaviour, the overall predictive capability of the model inevitably reduces. In this work a hybrid agent-based modelling framework is introduced that aims to balance the demands of:behavioural realism and computational capacity, integrating a descriptive representation of driver behaviour with a simplified, collective model of traffic flow. The hybridisation of these approaches within an agent-based modelling framework yields a representation of urban traffic flow that is driven by individual behaviour, yet, in reducing the computational intensity of simulated physical interaction, enables the scalable expansion to large numbers of agents. A real-world proofof-concept case study is presented, demonstrating the application of this approach, and showing the gains in computational efficiency made in utilising this approach against traditional agent-based approaches. The paper concludes in addressing how this model might be extended, and exploring the role hybrid agent-based modelling approaches may hold in the simulation of other complex urban phenomena.

Modeling Microscopic Freeway Traffic Using Cusp Catastrophe Theory	IEEE INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article							STATISTICAL PHYSICS; FLOW; PATTERNS; HIGHWAY	This paper proposes a framework based on stochastic cusp catastrophe theory to model microscopic freeway traffic flow. The approach considers that each driver-regardless of being aggressive or timid-may shift his/her behavior and behave aggressively or timidly during driving. Based on the proposed modeling approach, the spacing of a driver is a function of his speed and acceleration. Moreover, the driver's behavior comprises of two equilibrium states-being aggressive or timid-and a shift between these states is considered to occur as a catastrophe phenomenon. Different models are developed with varying sampling intervals, while some of them possess memory properties. Results show that the cusp catastrophe model may accurately describe microscopic traffic, especially when compared to linear or logistic models. Results for models with memory are even more promising. Based on the proposed method, preliminary results on the critical regions of breakdown conditions or attitude shifting are described and discussed.

J	Zhao, TT; Nie, Y; Zhang, Y				Zhao, Tingting; Nie, Yu (Marco); Zhang, Yi			Extended spectral envelope method for detecting and analyzing traffic oscillations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Spectral envelope; Traffic oscillation; Spectrum analysis; Contributing Index	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TIME-SERIES; HIGHWAY; PROPAGATION; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; NETWORK	We propose using a spectral envelope method to analyze traffic oscillations using data collected from multiple sensors. Spectral envelops can reveal not only the salient frequencies of periodic oscillations of traffic flow, but also the relative strength of these oscillations at different locations. This paper first introduces time dimension into the existing spectral envelope method so that it can be applied to study the evolution of vehicular traffic oscillations. The extended spectral envelope method proposed in this paper, or ESPE, discards the normalization procedure in the standard method. A new Contributing Index (CI) is proposed to measure the relative strength of oscillations at different locations. The extended spectral envelops can be constructed on long-term or short-term time scales. While the long-term analysis helps extract salient frequencies of traffic oscillations, the short-term analysis promises to reveal their detailed spatial-temporal profiles. ESPE offers two distinctive advantages. First, it is more robust against the impacts of noises. Second, it is able to uncover complicated oscillatory behaviors which are otherwise difficult to notice. These advantages are demonstrated in case studies constructed on both simulated and real data.

Although previous studies have investigated the impact of work-zone capacities on traffic flow, most did not consider interactions with construction resources. There is currently no mature standard or acceptable model that can be used for this purpose, and that would benefit both traffic and construction in an integrated framework; however, well-established, powerful simulation systems exist unique to each domain. To this end, in this paper, a construction-traffic interdisciplinary simulation (CTISIM) framework based on high level architecture is proposed to combine the power of each domain's simulation systems. A ready-mixed concrete production and delivery problem is adopted to demonstrate the benefit of the CTISIM, which optimizes construction resource arrangement and a concrete production schedule based on the real-time traffic conditions in a work-zone.

J	Zhang, XN				Zhang, Xiaoning			Optimisation methods of road pricing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH			English	Editorial Material						congestion pricing; road toll; road franchising; subsidy	ELASTIC DEMAND; MARGINAL-COST; TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; TRAFFIC CONGESTION; TOLL DESIGN; SOCIAL COST; BOTTLENECK; EQUILIBRIUM; ASSIGNMENT; CAPACITY	Toll charges are classified into congestion tolls (congestion pricing) and road tolls (private pricing) respectively, according to the purpose of pricing. Congestion pricing is used to mitigate network congestion by shifting traffic flow from peak periods to off-peak periods, from congested routes to less congested routes, or from private cars to public transport. Private toll pricing is used to recoup construction or maintenance costs of road links, when they are built fully or partially on private investment. This special issue reports some recent developments in road pricing. Three papers investigate congestion pricing, and one paper deals with toll adjustment for road franchising. The optimisation models and theoretical findings might be useful and meaningful for future research on road pricing.

Algorithm fusion method to enhance automatic incident detection on Melbourne freeways	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						automatic incident detection; intelligent transportation systems; traffic management; traffic surveillance	EXPRESSWAY; SINGAPORE	This paper addresses the transferability issue faced by many practitioners in developing an effective and efficient automatic incident detection algorithm for different freeways. An algorithm fusion procedure developed for the Central Expressway in Singapore is evaluated to demonstrate its transferability potential in detecting lane-blocking incidents along freeways in Melbourne, Australia. This study observes that the flow-based algorithm fusion options that use a set of different detection threshold values for various pre-incident traffic flow conditions possess promising transferability potential. They give a reasonably high detection rate of above 80% with false alarm rate levels below 0.2% with mean-time-to-detect values less than 150 seconds. These flow-based algorithm fusion options significantly outperform a model specifically developed for traffic conditions on freeways in Melbourne. In conclusion, this method is capable of providing an alternative to the commonly practiced methods in detecting incidents along different sites.

The study identifies how CACC vehicles affect the dynamics of traffic flow on a complex network and reduce traffic congestion resulting from the acceleration/deceleration of the operating vehicles. An agent-based microscopic traffic simulation model (Flexible Agent-based Simulator of Traffic) is designed specifically to examine the impact of these intelligent vehicles on traffic flow. The flow rate of cars, the travel time spent, and other metrics indicating the evolution of traffic congestion throughout the lifecycle of the model are analyzed. Different CACC penetration levels are studied. The results indicate a better traffic flow performance and higher capacity in the case of CACC penetration compared to the scenario without CACC-embedded vehicles.

Potential applications of speed dispersion in defining freeway level of service and air emissions evaluation	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						speed dispersion; coefficient of variation of speed; standard deviation of speed; freeway operations; air emissions	RELIABILITY	Speed dispersion, with respect to its statistical relationships with fundamental traffic flow parameters, is used to measure freeway level of service in the context of no more than x% of vehicles with travel time up to y% greater than the free flow condition.' It is argued that such a measure not only reflects mobility, reliability, and - potentially - safety, but also avoids the vague descriptions associated with each service level in the current US Highway Capacity Manual. These relationships are then applied to produce speed distribution estimates for the MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) model. It is argued that the MOVES model's approach limits the distribution in two speed bins, results in unsupported speed dispersion, and may cause identical distributions under various average speeds. The proposed revised approach based on speed dispersion generates specific spread-out distributions consistent with empirical data. The findings of these two applications bring new concepts to current practice.

The numerical results show that the traffic flow on the ring road with no ramp can be divided into three traffic states and that the propagating property and proportion of each state, and the deviation between the current traffic state and its equilibrium state are related to the initial density. Finally, the video data of the third ring road in Beijing qualitatively testify the numerical results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Tang, T.

J	Wei, LY; Wang, ZL; Wu, RH				Wei Li-Ying; Wang Zhi-Long; Wu Rong-Hua			Research and modeling of the lane-changing behavior on the approach	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						approach; mandatory lane-changing; discretionary lane-changing; comprehensive lane-changing	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON-MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; VEHICLES	In order to analyze the lane-changing behavior on the upstream of the intersections, based on the cellular automata traffic theory, a comprehensive lane-changing model for the traffic flow near the approach is proposed by combining the improved mandatory lane-changing model and discretionary lane-changing model. And the charts describing the scenarios of the space-time and traffic density for the traffic flow near the approach are obtained through simulation based on the comprehensive lane-changing model. Results show that the lane-changing rate at the approach is higher when the traffic density is in the ranges of [0, 0.2] and [0.4, 0.6]. The average vehicle speed is gradually reduced as lane-changing rate increases under median low vehicle stream density, but the variation of vehicle speed with lane-changing rate is not significant under high vehicle stream density.

The major lane changing models in the literature are categorized into two groups: models that aim to capture the lane changing decision-making process, and models that aim to quantify the impact of lane changing behavior on surrounding vehicles. The methodologies and important features (including their limitations) of representative models in each category are outlined and discussed. Future research needs are determined.

For this effort, predictions are needed of the traffic inflow into the network at motorways on the network boundary and at on-ramps. This paper presents an adaptive prediction algorithm for the inflows into the network in regular traffic situations based on stochastic control theory. The prediction algorithm is based on an adaptive prediction algorithm of T. Bohlin. The algorithm is designed and tested on traffic flow data of the ring road of Amsterdam. The results show that the algorithm provides robust predictions of traffic demand with relatively small errors for the next 30 min in a large-scale real-time environment.

In this paper, we developed a methodology for the short-term prediction of traffic flow using the stochastic differential equation (SDE). Since the current volume depends on the previous short-term volume and time, we used the Hull-White model. With the proposed method, a flexible short-term prediction of volume is suggested. It is possible to simulate traffic conditions easily and also detect incidents precisely. This method is applied in Tehran's highways, and the obtained results are compared with previous artworks. Our results offered a better fit to the traffic volume.	[Tahmasbi, Rasool; Hashemi, S.

J	Zhang, GH; Ma, XL; Wang, YH				Zhang, Guohui; Ma, Xiaolei; Wang, Yinhai			Self-Adaptive Tolling Strategy for Enhanced High-Occupancy Toll Lane Operations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Congestion pricing; dynamic tolling algorithm; feedback control; high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane; self-adaptive control mechanism	TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; TIME; CHOICE; WAVES; ROUTE; MODEL	In this paper, a self-adaptive tolling strategy (SATS) is developed for dynamically and systematically enhancing high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane system operations. This strategy enhances the overall system performance of both the HOT and general purpose (GP) lanes by better utilizing the HOT lane capacity while maintaining high speed and/or high travel-time reliability for HOT lane traffic when GP lanes are congested. To formulate SATS, the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards kinematic wave model is used to characterize HOT lane traffic flow evolution, and the unilateral Laplace transform is used to convert the system representation from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then, an adaptive tolling controller is designed with both the proportional and integral control components. Real-time traffic measurements, including lane occupancy, average speed, and flow rate, are utilized for toll rate calculations. Following a dual-phase control scheme, the appropriate flow rate for HOT lane utilization is computed, and the corresponding toll is estimated backward. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed tolling strategy, microscopic traffic simulation experiments are conducted using VISSIM. The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed tolling strategy performs reasonably well in improving the overall operations of HOT lane systems under various traffic conditions.

These models can be used for various purposes, such as predicting the number of road crashes or establishing relationships between these crashes and different covariates. However, the appropriate choice for the functional form of these models is generally not discussed in research literature on road safety. In case of run-off-the-road crashes, empirical evidence and logical considerations lead to conclusion that the relationship between expected frequency and traffic flow is not monotonously increasing.

Short-term Traffic Flow Prediction Using Group Method Data Handling (GMDH)-based Abductive Networks	ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						GMDH; Abductive network; Traffic count; Traffic flow prediction	MODELS	This study investigates a method of predicting traffic flow that employs the use of abductive networks based on the group method data handling (GMDH) for short-term traffic flow prediction. The GMDH algorithm relies on high-order polynomial input variables and it starts by building regression equations of order 2 or 3 for each pair of input variables. The new input variables are used for predicting the output in lieu of the original input variables. Based on pre-specified selection criteria, the best new input variables (polynomials) in terms of predicting the output are retained and used as input variables for the next layer to generate newer input variables of higher order (order of 4 if started with order 2). This process continues until the added value of the predicting power becomes insignificant and/or the model becomes practically complex for predicting purposes. Models for a linear road network were developed first using both spatial and temporal information without differentiating between weekdays and weekends. In the subsequent efforts, different models were built for weekdays and weekends. It was found that day-specific mode performance is not better than the generic model in predicting traffic flow. Models developed for predicting traffic after 15 min had correlation coefficients between 0.97 and 0.98. Models which were developed to predict traffic after 30 min were also robust but with slightly lower values of correlation coefficient. Due to the self-organizing nature of the models and the minimum required interventions, the models can be easily used by practitioners.

Application of multivariate geostatistics in the investigation of heavy metal contamination of roadside dusts from selected highways of the Greater Toronto Area, Canada	ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Heavy metals; Contamination; Multivariate geostatistics; Roadside dust; Highways; Greater Toronto Area; Canada	STREET DUSTS; URBAN SOILS; LEAD; WATER; CLASSIFICATION; VEGETATION; SEDIMENTS; POLLUTION; CADMIUM; JORDAN	A good understanding of roadside soil contamination and the location of pollution sources is important for addressing many environmental problems. The results are reported here of an analysis of the content of metals in roadside dust samples of four major highways in the Greater Toronto area (GTA) in Ontario, Canada. The metals analyzed are Pb, Zn, Cd, Ni, Cr, Cu, Mn, and Fe. Multivariate geostatistical analysis [correlation analysis (CA), principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)] were used to estimate soil chemical content variability. The correlation coefficient shows a positive correlation between Cr-Cd, Mn-Fe, and Fe-Cu, while negatively between Zn-Cd, Mn-Cd, Zn-Cr, Pb-Zn, and Ni-Zn. PCA shows that the three eigenvalues are less than one, and suggests that the contamination sources are processing industries and traffic. HCA classifies heavy metals in two major groups. The cluster has two larger subgroups: the first contains only the variables Fe, Mn, Cu, Cr, Ni, and Pb, and the second includes Cd and Zn. The geostatistical analysis allows geological and anthropogenic causes of variations in the contents of roadside dust heavy metals to be separated and common pollution sources to be identified. The study shows that the high concentration of traffic flows, the parent material mineralogical and chemical composition, and land use are the main sources for the heavy metal concentration in the analyzed samples.

J	Smith, JM; Cruz, FRB				Smith, J. MacGregor; Cruz, F. R. B.			M/G/c/c state dependent travel time models and properties	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Transportation; State dependent queue; Travel time; Approximations	TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; EMERGENCY EVACUATION; USER EQUILIBRIUM; QUEUING MODELS; CONGESTION; NETWORKS; FLOW; ALGORITHM; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS	One of the most important problems in today's modeling of transportation networks is an accurate estimate of travel time on arterial links, highway, and freeways. There are a number of deterministic formulas that have been developed over the years to achieve a simple and direct way to estimate travel times for this complex task. Realistically, however, travel time is a random variable. These deterministic formula are briefly reviewed and also a new way to compute travel time over arterial links, highway, and freeways, is presented based on an analytical state dependent queueing model. One of the features of the queueing model is that it is analyzed within the context of the theoretical three-phase traffic flow model. We show that the model provides a quantitative foundation alternative to qualitative three-phase traffic flow theory. An important property shown with the model is that the travel time function is not convex, but a sigmoid S-shaped (i.e. logistic curve). Extensive analytical and simulation experiments are shown to verify the S-shaped nature of the travel time function and the use of the model's method of estimation of travel time over vehicular traffic links as compared with traditional approaches. Finally, it is shown that the point-of-inflection of the S-shaped curve represents the threshold point where the traffic flow volume switches from Free Flow to Congested Flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jin, PJ; Yang, D; Ran, B				Jin, Peter J.; Yang, Da; Ran, Bin			Reducing the Error Accumulation in Car-Following Models Calibrated With Vehicle Trajectory Data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Accumulative error; car-following models; Next-Generation Simulation (NGSIM); stability analysis; traffic simulation	TRAFFIC FLOW MODELS; STABILITY ANALYSIS; DYNAMICAL MODEL; SIMULATION; VALIDATION	With the development of probe vehicle technologies and the emerging connected vehicle technologies, applications and models using trajectory data for calibration and validation significantly increase. However, the error accumulation issue accompanied by the calibration process has not been fully investigated and addressed. This paper explores the mechanism and countermeasures of the error accumulation problems of car-following models calibrated with microscopic vehicle trajectory data. In this paper, we first derive the error dynamic model based on an acceleration-based generic car-following model formulation. The stability conditions for the error dynamic model are found to be different from the model stability conditions. Therefore, adjusting feasible ranges of model parameters in the car-following model calibration to ensure model stability cannot guarantee the error stability. However, directly enforcing those error stability conditions can be ineffective, particularly when explicit formulations are difficult to obtain. To overcome this issue, we propose several countermeasures that incorporate error accumulation indicators into the error measures used in the calibration. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the traditional and the proposed error measures through the calibration of five representative car-following models, i.e., General Motors, Bando, Gipps, FREeway SIMulation (FRESIM), and intelligent driver model (IDM) models, using field trajectory data. The results indicate that the weighted location mean absolute error (MAE) and the location MAE with crash rate penalty can achieve the best overall error accumulation performance for all five models. Meanwhile, traditional error measures, velocity MAE, and velocity Theil's U also achieve satisfactory error accumulation performance for FRESIM and IDM models, respectively.

The Process of Information Propagation Along a Traffic Stream Through Intervehicle Communication	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Distributed traffic information systems (DTIS); information propagation; intervehicle communication (IVC); probabilistic model	AD HOC NETWORKS; INTER-VEHICLE COMMUNICATION; DISSEMINATION	This paper proposes a model to calculate the average speed of transmission of intervehicle communication (IVC) messages in a general traffic stream on highways in the early stage of deploying distributed traffic information systems (DTIS). The model helps explain the relationship between average IVC message speed and traffic parameters such as equipped vehicle density, traffic flow speed, and traffic direction. Simulation results are used to verify the correctness of the model. This model needs a much shorter calculation time than a simulation. Moreover, the theoretical analysis helps provide more insightful explanations of the phenomenon for IVC performance analysis. The results of this paper would help people better understand the design criteria for DTIS.

However, because of various reasons such as sensor failure or transmission error, it is common that some traffic flow data are lost. As a result, various methods were proposed by using a wide spectrum of techniques to estimate missing traffic data in the last two decades. Generally, these missing data imputation methods can be categorised into three kinds: prediction methods, interpolation methods and statistical learning methods. To assess their performance, these methods are compared from different aspects in this paper, including reconstruction errors, statistical behaviours and running speeds. Results show that statistical learning methods are more effective than the other two kinds of imputation methods when data of a single detector is utilised. Among various methods, the probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) yields best performance in all aspects. Numerical tests demonstrate that PPCA can be used to impute data online before making further analysis (e.g. make traffic prediction) and is robust to weather changes.

J	Zhang, WT; Huang, B; Luo, D				Zhang, Wenting; Huang, Bo; Luo, Dong			Effects of land use and transportation on carbon sources and carbon sinks: A case study in Shenzhen, China	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING			English	Article						Carbon sink; Carbon source; Land use; Transportation; Four-step model; Shenzhen	GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS; ECONOMIC-GROWTH; VEGETATION; ENERGY; COVER	Carbon-sink and carbon-source estimation are of significance for carbon-emissions reduction. In this paper, we evaluated Shenzhen's annual carbon budget from 2000 to 2008 by measuring the presence of carbon sinks and carbon sources in the city. First, we used a coefficient approach based on factors such as land-use status and crop yield, to determine the number of carbon sinks in Shenzhen. Second, we identified urban carbon sources such as human respiration, industrial fossil-fuel consumption, cropland soil, livestock and transportation. We used a traffic-prediction tool, namely the four-step model, to determine traffic flow and the average speed of vehicles based on land-use types and the spatial distribution of road networks. Finally, we used the aforementioned methods to estimate the number of carbon sinks and carbon sources in Shenzhen from 2000 to 2008, along with its net carbon source. The results show that the number of carbon sinks decreased and the number of carbon sources increased in Shenzhen between 2000 and 2008. However, the net carbon source per million GDP decreased, which suggests that carbon-reduction efficiency improved during this period. Urban expansion and forest reduction were the major causes of the observed carbon-sink reduction. We identified transportation and industrial fossil-fuel consumption as Shenzhen's main carbon sources. The former produces high concentrations of CO2; the latter is related to the growth of secondary industries. In addition, the spatial distribution of the net carbon source from 2000 to 2008 indicated that Shenzhen's net carbon source increased both spatially and temporally during this period.

We begin at the microscopic level by formulating a stochastic cellular automata model with explicit rules for pedestrians moving in two opposite directions. Coarse-grained mesoscopic and macroscopic analogs are derived leading to the coupled system of PDEs for the density of the pedestrian traffic. The obtained first-order system of conservation laws is only conditionally hyperbolic. We also derive higher-order nonlinear diffusive corrections resulting in a parabolic macroscopic PDE model. Numerical experiments comparing and contrasting the behavior of the microscopic stochastic model and the resulting coarse-grained PDEs for various parameter settings and initial conditions are performed. These numerical experiments demonstrate that the nonlinear diffusion is essential for reproducing the behavior of the stochastic system in the nonhyperbolic regime.

J	Shao, ZQ				Shao, Zhi-Qiang			Lifespan of classical discontinuous solutions to general quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws with small BV initial data: Rarefaction waves	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Generalized Riemann problem; Quasilinear hyperbolic system of conservation laws; Classical discontinuous solution; Rarefaction wave; Lifespan	RIEMANN SOLUTIONS; CONTACT DISCONTINUITIES; GLOBAL EXISTENCE; STABILITY; UNIQUENESS; EQUATIONS; SHOCKS	In the present paper the author investigates the global structure stability of Riemann solutions for general quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws under small BV perturbations of the initial data, where the Riemann solution contains rarefaction waves, while the perturbations are in BV but they are assumed to be C-1-smooth, with bounded and possibly large C-1-norms. Combining the techniques employed by Li-Kong with the modified Glimm's functional, the author obtains a lower bound of the lifespan of the piecewise C-1 solution to a class of generalized Riemann problems, which can be regarded as a small BV perturbation of the corresponding Riemann problem. This result is also applied to the system of traffic flow on a road network using the Aw-Rascle model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Polimeni, A; Vitetta, A				Polimeni, Antonio; Vitetta, Antonino			Vehicle routing in urban areas: an optimal approach with cost function calibration	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						vehicle routing problem; optimisation; freight; genetic algorithm; city logistics	ANT COLONY OPTIMIZATION; ROAD NETWORK DESIGN; GENETIC ALGORITHM; CHOICE MODELS; TABU SEARCH; DEMAND	In this paper, a multi-step model related to freight movements in urban areas is formalised to solve a Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW). In modelling terms, the VRPTW is formulated to consider the optimum paths between all the customers combined to determine the best vehicle routes. The optimum path search with a selective mono-criterion approach is tackled. A model for forecasting the link cost is calibrated. Some procedures (traffic assignment, real-time system measurement, reverse assignment) for estimating system performance in terms of travel cost are also proposed. In terms of procedures, the VRPTW is solved with a genetic algorithm and two different crossover operators are reported and used simultaneously. A real case application is made, comparing the results of the proposed procedure with the routes of a truck (<6 tonnes) delivering dairy products to some retailers in a city. The contribution of this paper is to relate the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to transport the network theory. Indeed, the VRP is generally treated without considering network congestion. In the approach proposed in this paper, the costs are assumed to be functions of network characteristics and traffic flow, while a model for forecasting link costs is calibrated from real data.

The root locus method: application to linear stability analysis and design of cooperative car-following models	TRANSPORTMETRICA B-TRANSPORT DYNAMICS			English	Article						cooperative vehicles; car-following models; root locus method; linear stability	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; SIMULATION; HIGHWAY; INSTABILITY; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; WAVES	A global framework for linear stability analyses of traffic models, based on the dispersion relation root locus method, is presented and is applied taking the example of a broad class of car-following (CF) models. This approach is able to analyse all aspects of the dynamics: long waves and short wave behaviours, phase velocities and stability features. The methodology is applied to investigate the potential benefits of connected vehicles, i.e. V2V communication enabling a vehicle to send and receive information to and from surrounding vehicles. We choose to focus on the design of the coefficients of cooperation which weights the information from downstream vehicles. The coefficients tuning is performed and different ways of implementing an efficient cooperative strategy are discussed. Hence, this paper brings design methods in order to obtain robust stability of traffic models, with application on cooperative CF models.

The most popular and effective techniques used are so-called model-based traffic state estimators, which consist of a dynamic traffic flow model to predict the evolution of the state variables; a set of observation equations relating sensor observations to the system state; and data-assimilation techniques to combine the model predictions with the sensor observations. Commonly, both process and observation models are formulated in Eulerian (space-time) coordinates. However, recent studies show that (first-order) macroscopic traffic flow models can be formulated and solved more efficiently and accurately in Lagrangian (vehicle number-time) coordinates (which move with traffic stream) than in Eulerian coordinates (which are fixed in space). In this article such a Lagrangian system model for state estimation is used. The approach uses the extended Kalman filtering technique, in which the discretized Lagrangian kinematic wave model with an extension (node models) for network discontinuities is used as the process equation and the average relation between vehicle spacing and speed (the fundamental diagram) is used as the observation equation. The Lagrangian state estimator is validated and compared with its Eulerian counterpart based on ground-truth data from a microscopic simulation environment. The results demonstrate that network-wide Lagrangian state estimation is possible and provide evidence that the Lagrangian estimator outperforms the Eulerian approach.

However, offline algorithms remain important, as databases of historical travel times are needed for many intelligent transportation systems applications. In this paper a parsimonious method is presented for estimating off-line travel times based on local speed measurements along a route with uninterrupted flow, for example, on motorways. The interpolation between the different detector locations is done by reconstructing trajectories based on traffic flow theoretical principles. The proposed method is efficient, easy to calibrate, and shows reliable results even when detector spacing is relatively high. The method is compared to other existing methods and validated on a 40-km highway.	[Himpe, Willem W. E.; Tampere, Chris M.

Previous studies have shown that vehicle flow is more strongly correlated with morphological properties of streets than those of axial lines. In addition, street-based topological representations are more suitable for vehicle flow prediction, as well as more memory-oriented and global in nature. In this study, we construct a dual graph to represent the street-street relationship and propose a routing strategy for networks on the basis of gravitational field theory. We aim to diminish traffic congestion and enhance the transmission performance of networks. We borrow from gravitational field theory in establishing a gravitational field stimulated by a node in packet transmission and in defining the corresponding gravitational field equation. On the basis of this study, we present a mathematical model and a routing strategy. Experimental results indicate that compared with the shortest path routing strategy, the proposed method considerably enhances network capacity and effectively balances network traffic flow, especially for congested networks. We achieve critical gravitation that can always maximize network capacity, regardless of the values of other parameters.

They are based on the definition of similar variables for road traffic flow from the 1960's by Edie. The definitions are extended to include multi-class flows where pedestrians move in different directions or have different characteristics. The new definitions provide a foundation of already existing crowd flow models and support their further development and the development of better observation methods. (C) 2014 The Authors.

However, how to forecast traffic volume still is an important problem affecting the traffic theoretical and practical analysis. Firstly, this paper set up a three layers BP neural network basing on the actual situation to introduce the modeling process of the neural network in detail, and forecast the short-term traffic volume by the means of rolling forecast. Secondly, taking the Hailar Street in Hohhot for example, two groups of test data from the same time of different days and sequent time of the same day were trained and forecast. in addition, predicting results and actual results were compared, and the correlations between test data and predicting result was analyzed and disclosed. Finally, the conclusion shows the error is acceptable and BP Neural Network constructed is practical when prediction accuracy is not very high.

VSLs have increasingly reaped attention as a means to enhance road traffic safety. In this study pros and cons of the VSL systems, and factors that affect on VSL impacts is summarized. Despite the potential effectiveness of utilizing VSLs, the success of this system is impacted by several factors such as VSL strategy used and the level of driver compliance. It is found that the level of driver compliance could be depends on vehicles' safety capabilities. Therefore, we have introduced an Adaptive Advisory Speed Limit Dissemination (AASLD) architecture which uses a novel VSL control strategy to ameliorate driver compliance with speed limits. The current speed limit determine based upon the vehicle safety capabilities (e.g. vehicle type, size, weight, safety features) in addition to traffic and road conditions. The simulation results showed prominently that AASLD improves traffic flow efficiency and occupancy. In addition, the results demonstrate that utilization of Vehicular ad-hoc network technology in AASLD has evidently reduced the incident detection time up to 31.2 percent and appliance of safe speed limit in comparison with traditional VSL strategies.

The proposed system comprises two main phases. The first phase includes estimation of vehicles' density in road segment leading to intersection by utilizing the combination of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication for transferring the acquired information to the Traffic Controller. The second phase contains assessment and analysis of obtained data from the first part to create various adaptive traffic signal cycles to control the traffic congestion. The most distinct capability of this approach which makes it more effective in comparison with its rival approaches, is controlling the traffic flow of vehicles in adjacent intersections by considering the future destination of vehicles and anticipation in traffic signal timing of contiguous intersections. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of proposed method in comparison with one of the known VANET-based traffic signal controlling systems methods named MC_DRIVE from the matter of reduction in communication overhead, relative delay of the vehicles in the intersection and accuracy of vehicles' density estimation.

Recently, monitoring the traffic flow using mobile phones data from wireless telecom operators has shown to be promising. However, the difficulty lies in identifying the vehicle type of the mobile phone holder. In this paper, we propose an agglomeration clustering algorithm to classify all the phones detected on a observed freeway into a number of clusters such that each cluster indicates a travelling vehicle. In the algorithm, each phone is initially treated as a cluster, then highly similar clusters are merged into one as they come from the same vehicle. After clustering analysis, the vehicle type of each cluster is recognized based the counts and speed of phones within the cluster. Different from previous work, in case of phone location data missing, we use the incomplete original data rather than estimating the missing information by interpolation methods, which avoids the errors caused by data interpolation. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the previous work, and the improvement is more obvious on datasets with missing data.

Based on the image calibration, visual loop detectors are built up in the surveillance video of the intersection. Then, the characteristics of the traffic flow, such as flow rate, velocity, queue length, can be obtained by the video detection based on these detectors in real time. With further analysis of the traffic flow in the channelized lane, the variable lane's orientation is determined for the objective of enlarging the traffic capacity of the intersection. Based on the simulation on the software VISSIM, we verify that the proposed method can enhance the traveling capability and reduce the congestion, compared with the original control method.

This paper proposes a model, based on temporal data mining, to describe traffic flow evolution when accidents happen on highways. Time series model was constructed by using Cell Transmission Model to reflect the state of traffic flow by ternary numbers. To overcome the defect of Euclidean distance, which does not consider the linear drift in the time domain, and to reduce the computational cost, Discrete Fourier Transform was implemented to turn the time series from time domain to frequency domain. By clustering analysis, the traffic dynamics can then be studied. A numerical experimentation was carried out and the result showed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Based on actual observation traffic flow data of freeway, to determine the probability distribution and cumulative probability distribution of microscopic traffic flow parameters(such as velocity, acceleration, time headway, lateral offset and so on) under rainy environment; and give velocity difference-velocity, acceleration-velocity, lateral offset-velocity distribution function above the law under rainy weather. Finally, validation results from the remaining data show that the distribution function can effectively describe the distribution of traffic flow under rainy environment, which can enrich freeway traffic flow theory, and provide a theoretical basis and practical value for the highway traffic management and control.

In this paper, we present a novel macroscopic method, named interactable cooperative driving lattice hydrodynamic model (Interactable CDL-H model). We describe traffic flow along lanes and flow interactions between lanes in a uniformly continuum frame. We further consider various constraints for a detailed lane-changing simulation. The model owns the efficiency of traditional macroscopic traffic models and can describe lane-changing behaviors effectively. It physically describes where/when/how traffic flow goes into (out) of a lane, which make it possible to simulate and display lane-changing behaviors in large-scale virtual environments. The validity and efficiency of the interactable CDLH model are demonstrated by comparing simulation results with real traffic data and one-dimensional CDLH model.

However, speed-advisory systems enabled by on-vehicle devices are much cheaper and easier to deploy. The first challenge of such systems is to get the traffic signal schedule in complex intersections. The second challenge is to get map information and calculate the distance. Facing these challenges we devise and implement a speed-advisory driving system called CityDrive, which harnesses the sensor and GPS data from a wide participation of smartphones to suggest proper speed for drivers so that they arrive at intersections in green phase. CityDrive first generates a road map and then infers traffic signal schedules, using only smartphones and a server. CityDrive does not eliminate stops at intersections, but it tries to maximize the probability that vehicles cruise through intersections in green phase. Both simulation and real test show that this continuous speed advisory service effectively smoothes traffic flow and significantly reduces energy consumption.

Previous studies focus on predicting the trajectories of single vehicles. Due to many random factors, however, there is little regularity in the movements of a single vehicle in an urban area, and this motivates us to take a holistic network perspective. With this insight, we model the time varying regularities of road traffic flows in road segments and intersections by mining statistic trajectories of all vehicles in the network. Based on these regularities and local real-time traffic information, we propose a new method to calculate the expected transfer delay from a current position to a given destination. We also propose a method to collect updated destination information. By combining the above two methods, we design a routing algorithm for vehicle-to-vehicle data transmission in vehicular networks, and then prove that it is a linear-time algorithm. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm by using information of real taxi vehicles. The results show that the performance of our algorithm is significantly better than other solutions in terms of packet delay.

Factors like day of week, presence of vacation or salary disbursement or economic parameters are readily available and may affect traffic flow between two countries. Collection of traffic data on a consistent basis is a cumbersome process in terms of time and resources. Considering these two factors in mind, this paper investigated the feasibility of using exogenous factors with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT). It was found that inclusion of AADT for traffic prediction is beneficial and further analysis will be done in the future with detailed traffic data. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

It has already been asserted that traffic simulation provides a better approach to the analysis of freeway reconstruction than the traditional Highway Capacity Manual. In fact the users' delay on freeway under reconstruction, when traffic flow is under capacity, cannot be evaluated by the standard HCM procedures. The impacts on existing traffic patterns are significant: the costs of delay and safety suffered by users even for low flows requires to take adequate management actions. From the point of view of direct reconstruction costs, every attempt to reduce user cost brings an increase in the direct costs of rebuilding. So there is a clear trade-off between reducing direct costs and mitigating the costs to travellers and economic activities. The object of this paper is to allow the evaluation of the delay that is suffered by the users of two-lane freeways when only one lane is available. The delays for different flow levels and different lengths of the reconstruction area are evaluated with the use of a tailored new developed microscopic traffic simulation model.

The behaviour is classified in: Law-Abiding drivers, opportunistic Deviant drivers, cautious Non-Myopic drivers, tailgating Aggressive drivers, and ambivalent Imitator drivers. For each driver in a class, the instantaneous ratio between actual and preferred speed is measured. A ratio of 1 defines an efficient driver. Here we measure throughout the personal efficiency of a driver by comparing their ratio to 1. We then aggregate these personal measures for classes of drivers; the system is more efficient if the aggregate ratio is closer to 1. Our research leads to the following conclusions: efficiency declines with higher car densities; it improves with the presence of Deviant and Aggressive drivers; Non-Myopic drivers do not affect traffic flow in a significant way. Imitators are Law-Abiding drivers who temporarily mimic deviating driver behaviour. We note that Imitator drivers fare worse than Law-Abiding drivers, but slightly improve overall system efficiency. The most surprising conclusion was to see that although Deviant drivers deviate from traffic rules from a selfish desire to improve their personal efficiency, they fare the worst in the end, while overall contributing to all other drivers' personal efficiencies.

Wireless communication is a fundamental building block - it is needed to manage and to maintain the platoons. To keep the system stable, strict constraints in terms of update frequency and reliability must be met. We developed communication strategies by explicitly taking into account the requirements of the controller, exploiting synchronized communication slots as well as transmit power adaptation. The proposed approaches are compared to two state of the art adaptive beaconing protocols that have been designed for generic message dissemination. Our simulation models have been parametrized and validated by means of real-world experiments. We clearly show how taking into account specific requirements can be extremely beneficial even in very crowded freeway scenarios.

Such specifications allow very rich control objectives constructed from temporal operators such as "always" and "eventually" combined with Boolean operators and encompass e. g. safety, reachability, and liveness conditions. We use the cell transmission model of traffic flow on freeway networks to obtain a piecewise affine model of the traffic network, and we apply recent results on control of such systems from temporal logic specifications to synthesize ramp metering strategies that are correct by construction. We demonstrate our approach on several examples.

Real-Time Privacy-Preserving Model-Based Estimation of Traffic Flows	2014 ACM/IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (ICCPS)	ACM-IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	5th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS)	APR 14-17, 2014	Berlin, GERMANY	ACM, IEEE		Differential privacy; intelligent transportation systems; privacy-preserving data assimilation	NOISE; WAVES	Road traffic information systems rely on data streams provided by various sensors, e.g., loop detectors, cameras, or GPS, containing potentially sensitive location information about private users. This paper presents an approach to enhance real-time traffic state estimators using fixed sensors with a privacy-preserving scheme providing formal guarantees to the individuals traveling on the road network. Namely, our system implements differential privacy, a strong notion of privacy that protects users against adversaries with arbitrary side information. In contrast to previous privacy-preserving schemes for trajectory data and location-based services, our procedure relies heavily on a macroscopic hydrodynamic model of the aggregated traffic in order to limit the impact on estimation performance of the privacypreserving mechanism. The practicality of the approach is illustrated with a differentially private reconstruction of a day of traffic on a section of 1-880 North in California from raw single-loop detector data.

To handle this situation, the Slovak cities should have to solve their transport situations with more often use of ITS elements. One of the possibilities of optimal communication network use in the city is the management of traffic flow on the route, or its reroute from congested stretches to existing alternative routes of transport network. This use is suitable, if the likelihood of overloading is high, and the lateral routes have a sufficient reserve. High proportion of transport which is possible to reroute is a condition for success of this system. In our article we build a cost-benefit based model to compare two variants. The first variant includes a current state and in the second one designed changes will be incorporated. We use this model to solve the problems on communication network in the city of Zilina. As a modelling tool we use software Aimsun which allows a microscopic simulation. AIMSUN (Advanced Interactive Microscopic Simulator for Urban and Non-Urban Networks) is a software tool which is able to reproduce real traffic conditions on any network. It means that we can also use it to predict behaviour of network with implementation of vehicle guidance systems.

Prediction and estimation of flows, as a main application in this field, has gradually developed. Moreover, there exist some inherent relationships among various traffic flows, and the mining of related information can provide a platform for traffic flow prediction and estimation, and it can supply some guidance to layout traffic sensors. This paper presents a method of cluster by k-medoids to mine related information of traffic flows from spatial dimension. From spatial dimension, road lanes are clustered by k-medoids to constitute a table of related information. In order to make the mining of related information of flows more accurate, degree of saturation is also used to cluster related information. The results indicate that cluster through combination of flow and degree of saturation has a higher efficiency, and cluster by k-medoids outperforms that by k-means in all experiments.

To deal with the challenging scenes, we extract effective features via salient region detection and block segmentation. We use the extracted features in the region of interest to construct a regression model to get an estimated vehicle number for each frame. The vehicle numbers in consecutive frames form a vehicle number sequence. A mapping model utilizing state transition likelihoods is proposed to acquire the desired per minute traffic flow from the vehicle number sequence. The experiments on highly challenging datasets have demonstrated that the proposed system can effectively estimate the traffic flow for rain-drop tampered highway surveillance cameras at night.

Also they are sometimes imprecise and distorted due to data collection sensor malfunction. Additionally, events like congestion caused by traffic accidents add more uncertainty to real-time traffic conditions, making traffic flow forecasting a complicated task. This article presents a new data preprocessing method targeting multidimensional time series with a very high number of dimensions and shows its application to real traffic flow time series from the California Department of Transportation (PEMS web site). The proposed method consists of three main steps. First, based on a language for defining events in multidimensional time series, mTESL, we identify a number of types of events in time series that corresponding to either incorrect data or data with interference. Second, each event type is restored utilizing an original method that combines real observations, local forecasted values and historical data. Third, an exponential smoothing procedure is applied globally to eliminate noise interference and other random errors so as to provide good quality source data for future work.

Besides, their installation cost is so high that they are only present in the main roads. Several research groups are working on traffic-related problems, such as developing accurate monitoring tools, obtaining reliable data and traffic forecasting. In this work, a low-cost information system for the real-time traffic flow monitoring is presented, and using gathered data for traffic forecasting is proposed. Traffic flow forecasting has been carried out using several tools. Obtained results have been compared to determine which method is better for this real world problem. The results point to the SVM methods as better option for forecasting real traffic flow.	[Arenas, M. G.; Rico, N.; Rivas, V.

However, some measurements can lead to incorrect data which cannot further be used in subsequent processing tasks such as traffic prediction or intelligent control. In this paper, we propose a method selecting a subset of input sensors for a support vector regression (SVR) model which is used for traffic prediction. The method is based on a multimodal and multiobjective NSGA-II algorithm. The multiobjective approach allowed us to find a good trade-off between the prediction error and the number of sensors in real-world situations when many traffic data measurements are unavailable.

Connected vehicles can get and spread information of the accident vehicles, which assists drivers in estimating TTR of the road and making better route choice. The major work of this paper is the proposal of a TTR model to calculate the TTR of freeway affected by accident. Information of time delay, accident position, accident duration and traffic flow status, which can be obtained from connected vehicles, are used. To better explain the TTR model, a simulation case analysis is given, effect of accident duration variance on TTR is also tested. Results show that TTR model in freeway affected by accident based on connected vehicles is practical, and the TTR increases with the variance. The research results are helpful to drivers.

Accordingly, we propose a traffic flow estimation method using time-series analysis and geometric correlation. Firstly, we define a 3D heat-map to present the traffic state and spatial and temporal adjacent traffic condition. Thereafter, we model the dependency heat-map using spatiotemporal Markov Random Field and estimate the probability using logistic regression. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, it was tested using data collected from expressway traffic that were provided by the Korean Expressway Corporation, and its performance was compared with those of other existing approaches.

ALINEA uses real-time occupancy measurements from the ramp flow merging area that may be at most few hundred meters downstream of the metered on-ramp nose. In many practical cases, however, bottlenecks with smaller capacity than the merging area may exist further downstream for various reasons, which suggests using measurements from those further downstream bottlenecks. Recent theoretical and simulation studies indicate that ALINEA may lead to a poorly damped closed-loop behavior in this case, but PI-ALINEA, a suitable Proportional-Integral (PI) extension of ALINEA, can lead to satisfactory control performance. This paper addresses the same local ramp-metering problem in the presence of downstream bottlenecks, with a particular focus on the general capacity of PI-ALINEA with three distinct types of bottleneck that may often be encountered in practice, i.e. (1) an uphill case; (2) a lane-drop case; (3) an un-controlled on-ramp case. Extensive simulation studies are conducted using a macroscopic traffic flow model to demonstrate that the performance of ALINEA indeed deteriorates in each of these bottleneck cases, while significant improvement is obtained using PI-ALINEA in all cases. Moreover, with its control parameters appropriately tuned beforehand, PI-ALINEA is found to be universally applicable, with little fine-tuning required for field applications.

Traffic flow forecasting reads the historical traffic data and utilizes a forecasting model - Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) to predict short-term traffic flow. The traffic flow generation utilizes the Cell Transmission Model (CTM) to generate outgoing flow of a road of interest based on the predicted incoming flow from ARIMA. Predicted short term travel times can then be obtained through N-Curve Analysis. Compared to most studies, this paper presents a historical data-driven framework for travel time prediction that can be trained based on specific profiles of routes and cities. The motorway M4 in Sydney, Australia was used to test this framework. It is shown that the predicted travel times can be used to anticipate congestion episodes at the network level.

This paper has proposed to use Network Operation Reliability (NOR) to quantitatively depict the probabilistic feature of traffic breakdown to global gridlock. The Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automaton model has been used to simulate the traffic flow in a Manhattan-like urban network. A simple adaptive traffic light strategy has been proposed. It has been shown that via choosing proper parameters, the adaptive traffic signals are able to remarkably enhance the NOR and sometimes the average velocity and the arrival rate as well. The vehicle distribution has been investigated, which has heuristically explained the enhancement of the NOR.

Ex-ante data analysis approach for assessing the effect of variable speed limits	2014 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 17th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 08-11, 2014	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE			TRAFFIC FLOW	In this paper, an ex-ante data analysis method is developed for the assessment of the potential of improving freeway throughput by means of variable speed limits. Ex-ante evaluation of dynamic traffic management measures can provide valuable insight into the potential benefits of these measures. This information is needed when planning to implement dynamic traffic management measures. Ex-ante evaluations are usually performed by means of a simulation study. However, it is hard to reproduce realistic traffic flow characteristics in a simulation. This makes it hard to assess the potential benefits of a dynamic traffic management measure. An ex-ante data analysis, however, can provide insight into the benefits of such a measure. Therefore, a theoretical framework will be provided for analyzing the potential of jam prevention at fixed, infrastructural bottlenecks first. Then, a similar framework is developed to assess moving jam resolvability. Finally, this method is applied to off-line inductive loop detector data of the A13 freeway in the Netherlands in order to assess moving jam resolvability. It is found that approximately 18.7% of the moving jams on the A13 freeway are assessed as resolvable with variable speed limits.	[van de Weg, G. S.; Hegyi, A.; Hoogendoorn, S.

Notably no attempt has been performed to evaluate the impacts of such a sophisticated system on traffic. Another important point is the impact of continuous increase in the number of highly automated vehicles on future traffic safety and traffic flow. This work introduces a novel framework to evaluate these impacts in a developed microscopic traffic simulation environment. This framework is used on the one hand to ensure the functionality of the driving strategy in the early development stage. On the other hand, the impacts of increasing automation rates, up to hundred percent, on traffic safety and traffic flow is evaluated.

However, despite the increasing interest in the promotion of cycling in cities, little research has been carried out into the use of traffic forecasting algorithms for bicycle traffic. Structural time series models allow the various components of a time series such as level, seasonal and regression effects to be modelled separately to allow analysis of previous trends and forecasting. In this paper, a case study at a segregated bicycle lane in Dublin, Ireland was performed to test the forecasting accuracy of structural time series models applied to continuous observations of cyclist traffic volumes. It has been shown that the proposed models can produce accurate peak period forecasts of cyclist traffic volumes at both 1 hour and fifteen minute resolution and that the percentage errors are lower for hourly forecasts.

Nonetheless, the required number of micro-simulation runs for reaching an optimal DSC solution and their computational complexity hinder the use of micro-level models for DSC on large-scale motorways. The present study introduces a set of techniques that reduce the number of required micro-simulations, thus improving the computational cost. The proposed techniques: 1) split the motorway into stretches; 2) introduce an approach based on genetic algorithms to reduce the number of micro-simulations; 3) exclude, when possible, VMS combinations by applying solution approximation methods instead of micro-simulation. The method is evaluated through a number of test scenarios in a stretch of motorway A6 in the Netherlands.

Vehicles with different control models can be generated to investigate the effects of vehicle models and traffic environment on the traffic flow during simulations of congestion. A data log of the simulation can be exported for post-processing analysis. Following an analysis of simulation data under congested conditions, we found that a faster reaction time of an individual vehicle can raise the overall flow rate of a road, raising the critical vehicle density for congestion.

Biologically-Inspired Neural Network for Traffic Signal Control	2014 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 17th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 08-11, 2014	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				Urban mobility is a central concern of large cities around the world. The growing urbanization indicates the situation can be even worse. A traffic demand higher than the urban capacity generates traffic congestions, which can be reduced through an efficient traffic signal control method. This paper presents a Biologically-Inspired Neural Network for traffic signal control. Instead of focusing on the macroscopic optimization of urban traffic, like other works, the hereby proposed control method investigates a single intersection between streets. This way, it is possible to incorporate more knowledge about the system dynamics into the control model and analyze its effects on control efficiency. The proposed method consists of a competitive neural network, which balances feedforward and feedback inhibition to synchronize the activity of the neurons, and, thus, the semaphore activation. Moreover, other proprieties of biological neurons are adopted: intrinsic plasticity, to impose system constraints; and synaptic plasticity, to prioritize traffic flows. The flexibility of the neurons and its synaptic connections regarding parameter definition constitute the capacity of easily incorporating knowledge about the system dynamics into the control model. Results of comparative simulations validate the proposed method and illustrate its efficiency and consistency.

Based on this consideration, this paper aims at comparing the macroscopic and mesoscopic approaches for traffic flow simulation in signalised junctions. In terms of signal setting design, the considered decision variables are the green timings, the scheduling and the offsets thus the three steps optimisation (i.e. each step is referred to the optimisation of each decision variable) has been applied. In particular, the green timings and the scheduling are carried out at single junctions, by multicriteria optimisation, and the offsets are computed by monocriteria optimisation. Finally, the optimisation problems are solved through metaheuristics algorithms.	[Cantarella, G.

Active traffic and demand management (ATDM) methods, including Ramp Metering (RM), Variable Speed Limit (VSL), and Route Guidance (RG), can help delay or even avoid congestion. Currently, those measures have become predictive and integrated based on real-time data collection and facility coordination, e.g. Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based measures. In this generic approach, a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model is used for traffic state prediction and the control problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem; whereas, successful field implementation requires a computationally simple and accurate optimization technique to make it feasible in practice. In previous applications of MPC, common optimization techniques are the decision tree and sequential quadratic programming (SQP). They both perform well, but limited research has been conducted to assess and compare their effectiveness and efficiency. To address this research gap, this study tested their performance by applying an MPC-based VSL control.

This paper presents a short-term traffic flow forecasting model based on the least square support vector regression (LSSVR) algorithm, which is optimized by a glowworm swarm optimization (GSO) algorithm. The GSO algorithm is used to determine two core parameters in the learning process, which significantly influence the predicting performance in the model. An actual example of traffic flow data on one section of highway in Chengdu, China is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed LSSVR-GSO model. The experimental results show that the proposed LSSVR-GSO model has more accurate predicting results than the LSSVR model optimized by the genetic algorithm and the back-propagation neural network model.

This strategy is motivated by people's daily repetitive travel patterns between homes and working places. Statistical analysis of a real traffic network shows that traffic flows of junctions are repetitive with small variations on a weekly basis. The main idea of IT is that, daily traffic signal schedules are tuned with anticipation of traffic demands. In this paper, only phase split is tuned iteratively to balance the traffic demands from all directions in a junction. Each junction has its own controller and these controllers can work cooperatively to improve the network performance after several iterations. Therefore IT strategy is scalable for arbitrary large urban networks. Marina Bay and Clementi areas in Singapore based on real traffic data are simulated and simulation results show that IT strategy can improve the performance considerably comparing with fixed-time strategy.

One of the best accepted solutions to relieving congestion involves optimization of resources already available, by means of balancing traffic flows to minimize travel delays. To achieve this optimization, it is necessary to collect and process Floating Car Data (FCD) from vehicles. In this paper we evaluate the repercussions of partial information on the overall traffic view, and consequently on the outcome of the optimization. Our study focuses on the role of the user participation rate and the availability of Road Side Units to collect the FCD. By means of simulation we quantify the impact of partially-available information on the computation of route optimization, and how it impedes traffic flows. Our results show that even minor uncertainties can significantly impact routing strategies and lead to deterioration in the overall traffic situation.

Comparison of Queue Estimation Accuracy by Shockwave-Based and Input-Output-Based Models	2014 IEEE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC)			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE 17th International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC)	OCT 08-11, 2014	Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		Recurrent Bottleneck; Traffic Congestion; Queue Estimation	FREEWAY; CONGESTION	Accurate queue estimation of traffic congestion at recurrent freeway bottlenecks is an important part of developing effective traffic control strategies. Two traffic flow analytical techniques are always employed in studying queuing processes: shockwave analysis and input-output analysis. These two techniques have been taken as separate tools for estimating queue length (size) in a number of studies. Shockwave analysis is particularly well-suited to evaluating the space occupied by the queuing process in units of length, e.g. metre, kilometre etc. Input-output analysis is always employed for vertical queue size in terms of the number of queued vehicles; however, some studies argued that this method underestimated queue size. This paper highlights the reason in the literature for underestimation of queue length with input-out analysis. The objective of this study was to compare real-time queue estimation accuracy using two proposed models based on the two analytical techniques, after investigating the dynamic characteristic of traffic flow at the bottleneck in the freeway. The parameters were determined using discrete field data collected along an urban freeway corridor, Whitemud Drive (WMD), in Edmonton, Canada. This study illustrated that although the two proposed models estimate queue length in different ways, they are compatible and capable of yielding accurate estimates of real-time queue length upstream of the studied bottleneck.

For complex urban traffic networks, it is necessary to design a high-level controller to regulate the traffic demands. Under the parallel control framework for complex traffic networks, we design a demand-balance MPC controller based on the MFD-based multi-subnetwork model, which can optimize the network traffic mobility and the network traffic throughput by regulating the input traffic flows of the subnetworks. The transferring traffic flows among subnetworks are indirectly controlled by the demand-balance MPC controller, and a global optimality can be achieved for the entire traffic network. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed controller in improving the network traffic throughput.

This paper presents a method for computing the location of traffic lanes by clustering vehicle trajectories. It employs a novel trajectory detection and clustering algorithm based on a new trajectory similarity distance. Moving vehicles are detected against a background estimated using a self-adaptive Gaussian mixture model (SAGMM), and fitted by a simple wireframe model. The vehicle is tracked by a Kalman filter using a landmark feature that is close to the road surface. The centre line of each traffic lane is computed by clustering many trajectories. Estimation bias due to vehicle lane changes is removed using Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC). Finally, atypical events associated with vehicles departing from the normal lane behaviours (e.g. lane changes) are detected.

This study examines factors in capacity bottlenecks. First, it is shown that the relation between longitudinal alignment and traffic flow is important, whereas differences in driver characteristics, number of lanes, and overtaking have secondary effects since the bottleneck position is independent of day, time slot, and number of lanes. Second, to clarify the effect of longitudinal alignment on traffic flow, the accumulation of car-following method on a driving simulator is applied. Third, because traditional approaches that model traffic flow by car-following behavioral models and traffic flow simulation do not necessarily succeed in predicting bottleneck position, a new idea is proposed to extract the influence of longitudinal alignment on traffic flow. Based on the existence of exchange interactions in headways, the characteristics of traffic flow are condensed to a pair of variables, called hyperparameters, by hierarchical Bayesian estimation. The estimated hyperparameters are used to estimate flow. Specifically, a proxy traffic flow is generated, and finally the applicability of the idea of model exchange interactions in time headway is discussed.

The objective of this paper is to provide a methodology for modeling incidents in microscopic traffic simulation environment. Queue lengths and shockwave propagation speeds resulting from incidents obtained from analytical kinematic wave theory (Lighthill - Witham Richard or LWR) were used to calibrate incident model in microscopic traffic simulation (VISSIM). A two lane freeway along the HRBT corridor was taken as a test bed. Fundamental diagram corresponding to the corridor was developed using Van-Aerde traffic mode and was used as an input to LWR. Queue length as a result of incidents blocking only one lane and both lanes were analyzed. Reduction in capacity, as suggested in HCM, was considered in the process of incident model calibration. The results suggest that a well calibrated incident model in VISSIM is capable of reproducing the queue lengths and shockwaves obtained from LWR and thus can be used for understanding the impact of incidents on freeways and testing alternative traffic management strategies, e.g., minimize delay or emissions.

In Europe more than 12% of the traffic network is daily congested. Hereby a reliable and dynamic congestion forecast is the key to avoid and/or compensate such locale bottleneck situations. Hence, this contribution focuses on a cloud-aided, lane-specific position determination of vehicles using a so-called Local Interference Compensation to enable a more detailed and lane-accurate traffic prediction (e.g. detecting short-dated roadworks or car breakdowns), and by that traffic-flow manipulation in the future. Thereby, the scientific challenge is to predict, quantify and compensate the inevitable local impacts to the positioning accuracy when using ordinary GNSS receivers. Beneath the detailed explanation of the LOCATe system itself, this contribution will also provide quantitative experimental validation and performance evaluation tests using an Advanced Software-Defined GNSS Receiver solution on geo-referenced points, which fit the definition of the introduced urban canyons.

Minimizing the Driving Distance in Ride Sharing Systems	2014 IEEE 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI)	Proceedings-International Conference on Tools With Artificial Intelligence		English	Proceedings Paper	26th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)	NOV 10-12, 2014	Limassol, CYPRUS	IEEE, IEEE Comp Soc, Biolog & Artificial Intelligence Fdn, Austrian Airlines, Cyprus Tourism Org, Univ Cyprus				Reducing the number of cars driving on roads is an important objective for smart sustainable cities, for reducing emissions and improving traffic flow. To assist with this aim, ride-sharing systems match intending drivers with prospective passengers. The matching problem becomes more complex when drivers can pick-up and drop-off several passengers, both drivers and passengers have to travel within a time-window and are willing to switch roles. We present a mixed integer programming model for this switching rider problem, with the objective of minimizing the total distance driven by the population. We exhibit how the potential saving in kilometers increases as the driver flexibility and the density of the distribution of participants increases. Further, we show how breaking symmetries among the switchers improves performance, gaining over an order of magnitude speed up in solving time, and allowing approximately 50% more participants to be handled in the same computation time.

GPS devices offer new opportunities for short-term traffic prediction, especially in arterial road networks where traditional fixed-location sensors are sparse or expensive to install. However, GPS data is often sparse both temporally and spatially. On its own, it is often insufficient for real-time traffic prediction. We consider the fusion of two types of data for the purpose of dynamic traffic prediction: GPS data that is provided as point speeds, rather than trajectories, as well as traffic data that is available from previous tracking. Inspired by the observation that a driver often has its own route selection behavior, we define a mobility pattern as a consecutive series of road segment/link selections that exhibit frequent appearance along all the itineraries of the vehicle. We predict the traffic flow using a hybrid method based on Variable-order Markov Model and adding on top of it the average speed of all the vehicles passing through each road segment. Our solution comes with a highly scalable traffic simulator application that can be used to predict, manage and optimize car traffic in cities. The prediction accuracy is estimated according to various criteria.

Practical applications have shown that static route choice models can not meet passengers' travel demands, because route choice is a typical multi-objective programming problem affected by many dynamic factors, such as real-time traffic state, link travel time, traffic incident, intersection delay and so on. In this paper, I proposed a multi-objective dynamic route choice function with the minimum of link travel time and distance as the target, which travelers paid most attention to when they chose the route. Also I got travel time reliability as the model constraint to against the complexity and indetermination of traffic flow. And I obtained the link travel time by short-term forecasting based on measured traffic data of the network. Finally, in order to test its reliability, I established a simulation road network for real-time traffic data, and solved the model I put forward by improved genetic algorithm. Fortunately, I obtained an exciting result.

Based on the interval velocity measurement system, various traffic parameters of the highway are obtained, and a state model with these associated parameters is built for the travel time estimation. Then, the probability distribution of the system state is simulated by a set of particles according to Bayesian theory. The distribution of these particles is updated real-time based on the state transition model and re-sampling method at last. The estimated travel time is given based on the predicted system state distribution. The proposed method learns the system state transition model based on the history data derived from the interval velocity measurement system. And the introduction of the particle filters improves the proposed method greatly to handle the dynamic and uncertainty of the system. Simulation experiments are taken on the traffic data from the detection sensors on several road sections. The results show that the proposed method has much better prediction performance than some traditional methods, and validate this method can be applied on the route travel time prediction of a dynamic traffic flow.

Traditional arterial coordination methods are usually off-line control methods based on mixed-integer linear program. These methods cannot adapt to changes of traffic flow, for instance, although there are very few cars in a branch road, timing plan will not adjust. Thus, we proposed a semi-actuated arterial coordination method which is a combination of practical actuated traffic control and traditional arterial coordination control. Five adjacent intersections of Huanghe Second Road in Binzhou City, Shandong Province, China are selected to test our method. We use microscopic traffic simulation software Q-PARAMICS to simulate and simulation results show that semi-actuated arterial coordination can effectively improve the performance index.

To address this problem, a novel Cell-Link Model (CLM) is developed in this paper. The CLM establishes road traffic network modeling procedure and puts forward a series of steps to implement network abstraction. The present method is applied to state forecasting of a sample network, and simulation results show that, our method can obtain accurate predict results with high computational efficiency. Therefore, the present method can meet the demand of urban road traffic network state forecasting.

Moreover, a preliminary simulation of urban traffic flow management is implemented with the help of MATLAB/SIMULINK and PARAMICS. The results demonstrate the efficiency and feasibility of the MPC signal control method, which can take all the operational constraints into consideration easily.

The difficulty is particularly pronounced in forecasting the complex non-linear dynamics of flow. Most of the state-of-the-art work on traffic flow prediction determine the parameters based on the fundamental relationship between flow, density and speed without considering its influence to the consecutive one. However, these approaches tend to fail in real life scenarios due to the negligence of the spatio-temporal dependence of parameters within road segments. In this paper, we propose a new traffic flow model to predict the arterial travel time using probe data. We then evaluate our model under various traffic conditions to determine its feasibility for near-future traffic flow prediction. The proposed method presents promising results by outperforming the state-of-the-art in predicting near-future traffic flow on roads in case of sparse data and high flow density.

The integration of intelligence from e. g. transportation provides opportunities for new services for local balancing. In this paper we introduce a method of cooperative balancing between adjacent grid segments for local power balancing which uses the mobility of electric vehicles with short-term charging needs in the load profile adaptation for grid segments through the exchange of EV charging demands between grid segments. Hereby travel tolerances like speed, direction, and charging needs are exploited. The method will be assessed through simulations in a two-gridsegment setup and a fleet of electric vehicles. Practically, the method serves a dynamic charging station assignment respecting immediate user preferences. Results show, that the method contributes to the prevention of critical load levels to impact the grid balancing by linking with the traffic flow as input (prediction) as well as controllable variable (via charging assignments).

The author analyzes factors like traffic flow and safety performance respectively, and proposes the theory basis for making more reasonable rules. The author first establishes evaluation system of traffic safety. Then, we compare the freeway network to power network to find a solution, and establish a traffic flow model based on power flow (TFPF). It calculates power flow. So it applies the formula mode back to the traffic network, chalking up the performance of the traffic condition. We utilize cellular automata (CA) method to simulate traffic circulation, and verify the accuracy of above model with the obtained data.

The transportation and telecommunication systems have witnessed a great improvement throughout the last decades. In our previous works, we proposed and evaluated an intelligent disaster management system based on emerging ICT (Information and Communication Technologies) technologies with a focus on transportation environments; the proposed system used Vehicular Ad hoc Network and Cloud computing technologies. Given this trend, in this paper, we investigate the potential of the proposed system to improve the transportation evacuation strategies. We develop a tool to facilitate the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) measures in simulated evacuations. An increase in the possibility of saving lives and properties has been noticed when modelling the impact of a disaster on a city data based on applying evacuation strategy plan such as Demand Strategy (DS). Substantial benefits in terms of improved and balanced traffic flow are achieved.

However, the V2V link is easily blocked due to the low antenna height. The vehicular obstructions also lead to strong shadowing effect, which has been ignored in the V2V system performance evaluation. By incorporating channel state transition with a measurement-based dual-slope path loss model, a light-of-sight (LOS) blocked model is presented for the V2V highway scenarios. The joint effects of radio environment and traffic flow on link connectivity are investigated to represent the obstruction probability and inter-vehicle connectivity probability. All the analytical results are validated by extensive simulations under a measurement-based propagation model. The results can be used for the system design and development of a channel simulator for V2V communications.

Unlike previous research, this paper presents two different optimization problems for maximum system capacity over a highway corridor, using both a time-gap based traffic model describing traffic flow and the limited traffic data measured by existing field facilities. Our proposed algorithms are coordinated ramp-metering controls controlling the metered rates at system-wide entrance ramps. The origin-utilization relationship is taken into consideration in providing the mathematical derivation for the steady-state optimization problem. This scheme regulates on-ramp flows so as to keep traffic densities along the system below their critical densities. To prevent an increase in adjacent street traffic, which might be caused by this scheme, a time-variant linear programming problem is provided with on-ramp queue control and traffic flow estimation. Comparative simulation results for two optimization problems are presented.

However, they disturb and reduce the traffic fluency due to the queue delay at each traffic flow. In this work, we introduce an Intelligent Traffic Light Controlling (ITLC) algorithm. This algorithm considers the real-time traffic characteristics of each traffic flow that intends to cross the road intersection of interest, whilst scheduling the time phases of each traffic light. The introduced algorithm aims at increasing the traffic fluency by decreasing the waiting time of traveling vehicles at the signalized road intersections. Moreover, it aims to increase the number of vehicles crossing the road intersection per second. We report on the performance of ITLC and we compare ITLC to previous algorithms in this field for different simulated scenarios. From the experimental results, we infer that ITLC reduces the queuing delay and increases the traffic fluency by 25% compared to previous traffic light signal schedules. Furthermore, ITLC increases the throughput of each signalized road intersection by 30%.

Various efforts have been made to smooth traffic flow and reduce air emissions and fuel consumption in stop-and-go conditions. In this paper, we propose a cooperative algorithm based on inter-vehicle communications (IVCs) to suggest advisory speed for the purpose of smoothing vehicle's speed profile without sacrificing the transportation efficiency. By utilizing the preceding vehicle's information, the algorithm extract the period of fluctuations and estimate the average speed of traffic flow to provide an appropriate speed suggestion. In simulation, our algorithm is evaluated with real-world traffic data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and show that the CO2 emissions can be reduced by up to 26.9% while the fuel consumption can be saved by 24% to 28%.

Despite extensive negative externalities for individual drivers and society, the search for parking is a little researched area. The aim of this study was to review and identify factors that influenced an individual's on-street parking search decisions. These factors were time cost, pricing, areawide parking policy, and personal and socioeconomic characteristics. The study also examined methodological and modeling approaches applied to on-street parking searches. The paper identifies a research direction to investigate factors that influence parking search behavior across cities and countries, which will enable interspatial comparisons of influencing factors. The quantification of the economic, environmental, and safety impacts of the search for parking is a further important research area, which can be accomplished through an examination of the impact made by vehicles in search of parking, as distinct from the impact of through traffic. The findings of the present study have potential urban parking policy applications, which could reduce the number of vehicles that search for parking, with associated environmental and economic benefits.

The Highway Capacity Manual has been used as the authoritative source for defining and estimating capacity in the United States. With increased traffic detector data availability in recent years, it is now feasible to locally measure capacity at bottleneck spots with different methods. This study investigates the benefits and necessity of implementing DTA in the analysis of advanced strategies, such as managed lanes, and the importance of the calibration of the associated traffic model parameters. In this regard, the importance of coding capacity based on detector measurements in DTA tools is illustrated, particularly when there is evidence that the modeled corridor capacity is lower than estimates based on the Highway Capacity Manual. The shortcomings of utilizing the traffic flow model of static assignment tools for assessing managed lanes, even when the measured capacity values are coded, are also demonstrated; this drawback illustrates the need to utilize simulation-based DTA modeling for such assessments.

J	Yang, F; Yun, MP; Yang, XG				Yang, Fan; Yun, Mel-Ping; Yang, Xiao-Guang			Travel Time Distribution Under Interrupted Flow and Application to Travel Time Reliability	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							VARIANCE; FREEWAYS; LEVEL	The travel time distribution under interrupted flow based on radio frequency identification detected data is analyzed. The urban road network studied is in downtown Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, in China, where video cameras and radio frequency equipment are installed at some arterial links to acquire traffic flow data including vehicle type, passing time, and spot speed. On the basis of the radio frequency identification data, the travel time distribution under interrupted flow shows a bimodal curve instead of a unimodal curve. This finding suggests that travel times under interrupted flow are not independent and identically distributed and can be divided into two components, the uninterrupted component and the interrupted component, according to whether vehicles experience intersection control delay. Six convex distribution models are presented, and an expectation maximization algorithm is adopted to obtain the best distribution for each link unit. The results indicate that travel time under interrupted flow generally follows a bimodal distribution. The parameters of the models can distinguish travel times between those encountering delay and those without delay. This finding demonstrates that intersection control delay plays a predominant role in travel times under interrupted flow. Two main travel time reliability indexes under interrupted flow obtained by the parameters of the bimodal distribution, expected travel time and RATIO, are presented as applications. Expected travel times indicate the average levels of travel times of two independent components, and RATIO represents the ratio of the uncertain part of the travel times. The analysis indicates that these two indexes can capture the characteristics of interrupted-flow travel time reliability, which is mainly caused by link length, number of intersections, and mixed traffic flow.

Mainstream Traffic Flow Control at Sags	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FEATURES; CAPACITY	Sags are freeway sections along which the gradient changes significantly from downward to upward. The capacity of sags is considerably lower than the capacity of normal sections. Consequently, sags are often freeway bottlenecks. Recently, several control measures have been proposed to improve traffic flow efficiency at sags. Those measures generally aim to increase the capacity of the bottleneck, to prevent traffic flow perturbations in nearly saturated conditions, or both. This paper presents an alternative type of measure based on the concept of mainstream traffic flow control. The proposed control measure regulates traffic density at the bottleneck area to keep it below the critical density and hence prevent traffic from breaking down while maximizing outflow. Density is regulated by means of a variable speed limit section that regulates the inflow to the bottleneck. Speed limits are selected on the basis of a feedback control law. The authors evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy by means of a simple case study by using microscopic traffic simulation. The results show a significant increase in bottleneck outflow, particularly during periods of high demand, which leads to a considerable decrease in total delay. This finding suggests that mainstream traffic flow control strategies that use variable speed limits have the potential to improve substantially the performance of freeway networks containing sags.

Multivariate forecasting methods are becoming more popular because of their ability to capture both temporal and spatial evolvement in traffic. However, little attention has been given to quantify the effect of upstream and downstream traffic information, and the vast majority of published studies assume that the spatiotemporal relationship is specified in advance. Thus, the selection of surrounding traffic information as input parameters is somewhat arbitrary. To address that issue, this study investigated spatiotemporal relationships of speed series from consecutive segments under different traffic conditions by using the link speeds for nine segments extending over 12 mi on I-24 in Nashville, Tennessee. A prewhitened cross-correlation technique was proposed first to clarify the cross correlations between two speed series. The prewhitened cross-correlation function was performed on speed series for consecutive freeway segments for periods including the morning peak, midday off-peak, and evening peak. The analysis results showed that the correlations for consecutive segments were highly related to traffic conditions and that the effect of downstream traffic increased with the severity of congestion. Influences of upstream and downstream locations on current traffic were also found to be not symmetric in regard to the current site. The algorithm on properly choosing neighboring traffic information was proposed, and the lagged regression model with correctly identified input parameters (segments) outperformed others.

The major lane change models in the literature are categorized into two groups: models that aim to capture the lane change decision-making process, and the models that aim to quantify the impact of lane change behavior on surrounding vehicles. In this paper, we futher consider the complicated environment of expressway, and present a lane change model considering the influence of four surrounding vehicles. In order to establish the relationship between the lane change timing and reference longitudinal/lateral acceleration, every vehicle is simplified into a rectangle and the process of lane change is divided into four phases, including the phase in which the front wheel turning angle is 0 degree. Based on a group of mathematical equations, we derive a lane change model with parameters collected in prior reseach and actual road experiments. The details about lane change model and related equations are analyzed in this paper. The maneuverability of lane change rules represented in this paper are confirmed by MATLAB simulation. At last, the correctness and feasibility of this new lane change model is proved by simulation results.

For more complex freeway facilities, microscopic traffic flow simulation is widely used. In this case, the definition and the computation of the level of service must be compatible with the analytical methods. For the forthcoming edition of the German Highway Capacity Manual, standards and user guidance for the application of microscopic traffic flow simulation tools for quality of service assessment on freeways were developed. For typical freeway segments, standard parameter sets for the simulation tools VISSIM, AIMSUN, PARAMICS, BABSIM, and Simulation of Urban Mobility were developed.

This paper presents an investigation of the use of these products to assess advanced traffic management strategies such as incident management and ramp metering. The paper examines the impacts of input parameters to the traffic flow model and of the scenario generation module incorporated as part of the computational engines of the HCM-based reliability estimation procedure of freeway facilities. The results from the calibration of the traffic flow model of the computational engine indicate that adjusting the capacity values to the measured values based on traffic detector data improves the system's ability to replicate real-world queues and travel times. The results show that the methods used to derive incident attributes in the computational engine affect reliability performance measures, particularly the 95th percentile travel time index and the misery index, which are indicators of the worst 5th percentile conditions on the corridor. The assessment based on modeling results indicates that incident management can significantly reduce the 95th percentile travel time index and the misery index. The assessment of ramp metering shows only a slight improvement in reliability, but this result may be because of the inability of the model to assess adaptive ramp metering, which is the main type of ramp metering in use.

J	Guler, SI; Menendez, M				Guler, S. Ilgin; Menendez, Monica			Evaluation of Presignals at Oversaturated Signalized Intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							BUS PRIORITY; PRE-SIGNALS; LANES	One of the major causes of bus delays in urban environments is signalized intersections. A commonly used solution to give priority to buses at signalized intersections is to dedicate a lane for bus use only. This strategy allows the bus to skip the car queues and minimizes the bus delay experienced at the signal. However, especially for low bus flows, the strategy can waste valuable green time at signals and impose additional car delays. Overall, even when bus passengers enjoy reduced travel times, the total person hours of delay in the system can increase. To avoid this problem and utilize the full capacity of the main signal while still providing bus priority, the use of a presignal has been proposed. The goal of this research was to quantify the benefits of the use of presignals in systemwide total person hours of delay, specifically for oversaturated intersections. Theoretical formulas were developed to quantify the effects of a presignal on traffic flow, and the formulas were empirically verified. The theoretical model was used to compare the total delay with a presignal strategy with the total delay with a dedicated bus lane or fully mixed lanes. Bounds on bus-to-car occupancy ratios were quantified for which presignals provided the lowest delay compared with a dedicated lane or mixed lane strategy. The results showed that for oversaturated intersections, presignals were better for the system than dedicated bus lanes. Moreover, presignals could decrease the total person hours of delay compared with mixed lanes for large car demands.	[Guler, S.

This calibration effort posed two major challenges: 1) Only about half of the detectors on the mainline were functioning, and 2) no detection was available on the ramps. The only available ramp flow information were the Census counts on about 15 days back in 2009. The model calibrated based on sparsely available data from 2009 was subsequently used for projecting the state of the freeway in 2013. This is due to the fact that data quality significantly deteriorates after 2009 and almost no data is available after 2012. We demonstrate the algorithms developed to automatically calibrate a couple of macroscopic traffic flow models derived from the Cell Transmission Model. The algorithms estimate the unobserved input flows and replace faulty or missing mainline measurements. The unknown input estimation is achieved by an adaptive imputation scheme that uses the partial knowledge of the ramp flows as lower and upper bounds for the estimates. Whereas the fault diagnosis algorithm identifies bad measurements on the mainline and replaces them with profiles that agree with the model dynamics. Due to the inherent unobservability of the system in the absence of both mainline and ramp flow data, this heuristic substitution method is employed rather than a more rigorous state estimation scheme. The resulting calibrated model is able to reproduce the observed congestion patterns on the mainline for the 2009 data while keeping the estimated boundary flow inputs within the expected bounds to the extent where they don't violate the model dynamics. The model also performs well under projected conditions for 2013.

Historical sensor data is first clustered by the K-means method to obtain the representative data pattern of the sensor. For each K-means cluster and using the clusters centroid as the exogenous input, the time-varying output of the sensor is subsequently modeled as an ARMAX stochastic process, and identified in real time using a recursive least squares (RLS) with forgetting factor algorithm. Based on the identified ARMAX model, a D-step ahead optimal predictor is generated for each cluster and its associated estimated error prediction variance calculated. The cluster and its associated ARMAX estimate that produces the smallest estimated D-step ahead error prediction variance is selected at each sampling time instant to generate the optimal D-step ahead predictor of the sensor output. The proposed technique is applied to empirical vehicle detector station (VDS) data to forecast both freeway mainline and on-ramp traffic flow at specific locations over a horizon of one hour. Results indicate that the proposed traffic flow predictor often offers superior flexibility and overall forecast performance compared to using either only historical data or only real-time sensor data on both normal commute days and days when unusual incidents occur.

Prior work in this area has sought to understand the impact of intelligent vehicle technologies on traffic flow by making use of mesoscopic modeling that yields closed-form solutions. However, this approach does not take into account the self-organization of vehicles into clusters of different sizes. Consequently, the predicted absence of a large traffic jam might be inadvertently offset by the presence of many smaller clusters of jammed vehicles. This study-inspired by research in the domain of statistical mechanics-uses a modification of the Potts model to study cluster formation in mixed traffic flows that include both human-driven and ACC-enabled vehicles. Speciifcally, the evolution of self-organized traffic jams is modeled as a non-equilibrium process in the presence of an external field and with repulsive interactions between vehicles. Monte Carlo simulations of this model at high vehicle densities suggest that traffic streams with low ACC penetration rates are likely to result in larger clusters. Vehicles spend significantly more time inside each cluster for low ACC penetration rates, as compared to streams with high ACC penetration rates.

Here, we use information about the itineraries of 187260 ships during the year 2010 to construct a network of links between ports. The network has several features that set it apart from other transportation networks are shown. In particular, most ships can be classified into three categories: bulk dry carriers, container ships and oil & LNG gas tankers. These three categories do not only differ in the ships' physical characteristics, but also in their mobility patterns and networks. Container ships follow regularly repeating paths whereas bulk dry carriers and oil tankers move less predictably between ports. The network of all ship movements possesses a heavy-tailed distribution for the connectivity of ports and for the loads transported on the links with systematic differences between ship types. The data analyzed in this paper improve current assumptions based on gravity models of ship movements, an important step towards understanding patterns of global trade. We also study the traffic flow of Chinese ship-transport networks (CSTN) based on the weighted network representation, and demonstrate the weight distribution can be described by power-law or exponential function depending on the assumed definition of network topology. Other features related to Chinese ship-transport networks (CSTN) are also investigated.

The central element of the research is a case study assessing such changes in connection with the opening of the D47 motorway in its Lipnik nad Becvou-Ostrava section. The aim of the study is a comparison of traffic conditions before and after the opening of the motorway. The real data on the traffic load of the motorway sections are compared with the official and our own forecast, which is based on applying a basic form of the gravity model for the given area. The results of the analysis confirmed intuitive assumptions about changes in the spatial redistribution of traffic flows.

The fuzzy controller determined the traffic intensity of each phase according to each lane traffic flow and the queue length, and then decided whether to extend or terminate the current signal phase. With the average vehicle delays as evaluation index to measure the control performance of the control system, the simulation of the intersection of four phases was realized using Matlab. The simulation results shown that the two-stage fuzzy control system could effectively reduce the average vehicle delay, and it was superior to the traditional timing control system and induction control system.

Genetic Algorithm (GA) was applied to search the optimal solution of the proposed model. During the search process, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based analytical model and microscopic traffic simulation VISSIM were applied to evaluate the performance of possible solutions. The proposed model can be used to determine the deployment of dynamic speed limits, the displayed speed limit, and the timing to change these speed limits. The proposed model was tested using VISSIM in an urban freeway network of about 12 miles long. Different simulation scenarios with varying AADT from 60,000 to 12,000 were tested. It was found that when properly implemented, dynamic speed control can improve traffic flow conditions, reduce congestion and emission, and enhance network throughput. For example, in the selected urban freeway network with the AADT of 80,000, the proposed dynamic speed control strategy can save 5% average travel time, reduce 9% of the vehicles with high collision risk and about 11% emission.

J	Nassir, N; Hickman, M; Zheng, H; Chiu, YC				Nassir, Neema; Hickman, Mark; Zheng, Hong; Chiu, Yi-Chang			Network Flow Solution Method for Optimal Evacuation Traffic Routing and Signal Control with Nonuniform Threat	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TIME-VARYING FLOWS; ASSIGNMENT	An efficient two-stage network flow approach is proposed for the determination of optimal scenarios for integrated traffic routing and signal timing in the evacuation of real-sized urban networks with several threat zones, where the threat levels may be nonuniform across zones. The objective is to minimize total exposure to the threat (severity multiplied by duration) for all evacuees during the evacuation. In the problem formulation, traffic flow dynamics are based on the well-known point queue model in a time-expanded network representation. The proposed solution approach is adapted from a general relaxation-based decomposition method in a network flow formulation. The decomposition method is developed on the basis of insights into the optimal flow of traffic at intersections in the solution of the evacuation routing problem. As for efficiency, the computation time associated with the decomposition method for solving the integrated optimal routing and signal control problem is equivalent to the time required for solving the same optimal routing problem (without optimizing the intersection control plan) because the computation time required for determining the optimal signal control is negligible. The proposed solution method proves to be optimal. The method is implemented and applied to a real-sized. evacuation scenario in the transportation network of Tucson, Arizona.

In this strategy, certain intersection movements that may be permissible under normal operating conditions are prohibited so that arterial traffic flow will increase. A few previous studies examined this strategy with contraflow operations. However, the benefits of crossing elimination alone remain unclear. An assessment of the effects of intersection crossing elimination during evacuations helps fill this knowledge gap. A simulation optimization model was developed to determine the near-optimal configuration of intersection movements from a set of pre-specified possible configurations for intersections in a given area. At the optimization level, the total travel time of evacuees was minimized, and at the lower level, all traffic was assigned to the network with DYNUST traffic assignment simulation software. A simulated annealing heuristic was used to solve the optimization problem. The entire method was applied to a real network to assess the impact of crossing elimination. Three scenarios were developed with combinations of evacuee destination and departure time distributions. Results for these scenarios indicated that total evacuee travel time was improved by about 3% to 5% (9,700 to 11,200 h for about 300,000 evacuees). The availability of through movements and the elimination of merging points were the two factors influencing the selection of modified configurations for intersection movement.

The use of a four-section display for the left-turn lane only with a flashing yellow arrow indication for permissive left turns has been deemed the new standard for signalization. With the advent of this new signal configuration, the opportunity to take the protected permitted left-turn mode to a new level of operation has been presented. Although numerous studies have developed warrants and guidelines for selecting types of left-turn control, no clear or uniform standards for the implementation of a variable left-turn mode that changes by time of day are currently available. This study developed an interactive decision support system for evaluating left-turn phasing alternatives by time of day by the use of a custom-design approach. The resultant model predicts the number of left turns during the permitted phase under different intersection conditions and assesses the operational and safety aspects warranting a permitted left-turn phase on the basis of specific criteria and thresholds; comparison of the amount of permitted green time given throughout the hour with the number of permitted left turns determines whether the opposing traffic flow is operating near or at saturation. The guidelines that were developed will provide traffic engineers with the tools that they need to use the efficiency of the permitted left-turn phase. Furthermore, the decision support system that was developed will assist traffic management centers with the identification of intersections requiring attention to or modification of the left-turn mode.

J	Wu, ZZ; Zhao, L; Sun, J				Wu, Zhizhou; Zhao, Li; Sun, Jian			A STUDY OF DYNAMIC RIGHT-TURN SIGNAL CONTROL STRATEGY AT MIXED TRAFFIC FLOW INTERSECTIONS	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						right-turn vehicles; signal control; traffic conflict; delay; non-motorized vehicles		Traffic conflicts among right-turn vehicles (RTVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs) and pedestrians were examined for urban signalized intersections with exclusive right-turn lane. This study proposed an approach to dynamically calculate the duration of the prohibited right-turn for vehicles by using a measure called the Degree of Clustered Conflict (DCC). The process of DCC control includes: 1) quantitative calculation of DCC value in the conflict area; 2) establishing the general cost model that combines the delay and conflict indicators; and 3) applying the DCC-control time model to control RTV in real time. Based on these, the paper presented a general approach of detailed dynamic on-line signal control process of RTV. Finally, the RTV control process was programmed based on VISSIM simulation to evaluate the control effectiveness. The results showed that the general cost (weighted summation of delay and conflict) of the RTV control decreases rapidly compared with non-control, fixed control and full control (drop of 58%, 35% and 42% under small flow conditions and 70%, 59% and 17% in the large flow conditions, respectively). The method not only improved the operation efficiency, but also reduced the potential safety risks among traffic participants when vehicles turn right at intersections.

However, misjudgements and human errors are the major cause of ship collisions according to research data. The decision support system of Collision avoidance is an advantageous facility to make up for this. Collision risk evaluation is one of the most important problems in collision avoidance decision supporting system. A review is presented of different approaches to evaluate the collision risk in maritime transportation. In such a context, the basic concepts and definitions of collision risk and their evaluation are described. The review focuses on three categories of numerical models of collision risk calculation: methods based on traffic flow theory, ship domain and methods based on dCPA and tCPA.

The response of the bridge to the traffic loads is monitored using strain gauges. The record of voltage is converted to the amount of relative deformation, respectively stress in the bottom flange of steel I beam of the bridge. In parallel with the measurements, the computer slab - wall model based on finite element method is developed. The computer model is used for comparison of calculated and measured stresses and deflections in the flanges and to determine the natural frequencies of the examined bridge structure.

However, the measurement of traffic flow remains to be controversial and difficult for the community. This paper points out an algorithm to acquire traffic parameters and studies the evaluation methods based on it. By extracting multi-color-feature information from image and vehicle shape match algorithm based on fuzzy rules, this method can efficiently distinguish vehicles from each other thus to calculate the traffic state parameters according to the results of this method. Then it can build congestion evaluation model with vehicle delay rate as the critical parameter. The experiment indicates that this method can acquire the accurate real-time road parameters and also proves it is valid to apply this method in urban traffic congestion evaluation in different situations.

This paper proposes the implement conditions of variable lanes for road section and verifies that the intersections connected with variable lanes can deal with the increased traffic successfully. Meanwhile, a bi-level programming model was established. The upper-level is the integrated optimization of lane allocating and the lower-level represents a network equilibrium mode, which predicts the drivers' reaction to any given lane allocation. Then, a heuristic solution algorithm is proposed to solve the bi-level programming model. The numerical test results show that the algorithm increases the capacity of the road network significantly and the two-way traffic is more balanced.

The matching of speed-density relationships from field and simulation was evaluated using statistical analysis as technique of pattern recognition. A test freeway segment under uncongested traffic conditions was selected as case study; based on traffic data observed at A22 Brenner Freeway, Italy, statistical regressions between the variables of traffic flow were developed. Analogous relationships were obtained using the Aimsun microscopic traffic simulator software, reproducing the on field conditions and varying some selected parameters until a good matching between field and simulation was achieved.

Indeed, many interventions of different types have been carried out, with a subsequent reconfiguration of the whole transport system connecting this node. Private and public transport needed to be reorganized after the inauguration of the new station with the objective of making mobility efficient as a function of the transport demand on the network. In order to evaluate both transport demand and supply, it has been necessary to undertake two surveys: the first one aimed at identifying the present circulation scheme and the one induced by the inauguration of the station. The second one aimed at quantifying the entity of traffic flows in "critical points", by counting the vehicles during peak periods. From the surveys, it has come out that in the peak morning period (7am -10am) 6,000 vehicles have been counted towards the rail node Garibaldi. This value decreases of almost 15% in the afternoon peak period (12 am - 3 pm) as well as in the evening one (5pm -8pm). From the simulation of the future scenario, which changes radically the access to Garibaldi Square and to the surrounding areas (where the CBD and the historical centre are placed), a new distribution of the vehicles is registered with a decrease of flows coming from the motorway A3 of more than 20% and of more than 30% approaching Garibaldi square. The implemented model is also able to assess future scenarios promoted by the local administration.

One of the key elements that contribute to obtain a high degree of prediction confidence, besides the quality of data previously mentioned and the skill of expert that harmonizes these, is the knowledge of current situation of transport demand and behavior of transport systems users. Knowing the current situation of transport demand can be achieved by traffic surveys, but when we are dealing with a transportation network, metering traffic flows on each sector requires significant resources, both for collecting and for processing and interpretation of results. Thus, the best method for highlighting the transport demand on each network element is transport modeling. The classic model used in this respect is called "the four-step model" and contains inter-related mathematical models concerning trip generation, their distribution on destinations, mode choice and trip assignment. Representation with a fidelity as high as possible of the modeled reality requires calibration and validation of each sub-model of the transport model. In this paper is highlighted the way in which the traffic data, collected with the help of a pneumatic tubes system, are used to calibrate the inter-related mathematical models. The case study is applied for the transport model of Pitesti City, Romania.

The location decision together with the one of goods' supply/distribution support the general framework of taking transport decisions: weather to realise the transport or not, choosing the destination, mode, time and frequency of the transport to be realised. Necessity of locating and/or relocating different facilities must foresee the transport flows that they would generate and that would eventually become traffic flows on an already congested urban network. The paper also tries to establish a best practice example in the field of intersection design and traffic management for further developments of new logistic activities. Considering the actual O-D matrix with traffic flows measured on the field we have determined a solution for creating access to a new commercial/logistic centre without creating congestion or important irregularities on a major route of Bucharest road network. The proposed solutions took into consideration traffic parameters like: flow, speed, queue length, delay, density and stop time.

These real-time crash risk prediction models are constructed by associating crash data with the real-time traffic surveillance data, collected by loop detectors. The objective of this paper is to develop a real-time prediction model that will potentially be utilized within safety management systems. This model aims to predict the traffic safety condition of a motorway. Given that the dependent variable (i.e. traffic safety condition) is considered dichotomous ("no-crash" or "crash"), the binary logistic regression technique is selected for model development. The crash and traffic data used in this study were collected between June 2009 and December 2011 on a part of the European route E313 in Belgium between Geel-East and Antwerp-East exits, on the direction towards Antwerp. The results of analysis show that several traffic flow characteristics such as standard deviation of speed and occupancy at the upstream loop detector, and the difference in average speed on upstream and downstream loop detectors are significantly contributing to the crash occurrence prediction. The final chosen model is able to predict more than 60% of crash occasions while it predicts more than 90% of no-crash instances correctly. The findings of this study can be used to predict the likelihood of crashes on motorways within dynamic safety management systems.

It is important to know how does the road construction behave when is loaded by the traffic and how does its degradation evolve. For this purpose the test field with real road construction was built. The main aim of the test field is to simulate traffic load in laboratory condition. From this point of view, very convenient is use of the GPR method in terms of the pavement and road investigation. At the beginning, two Horn antennas were used with central frequencies of 1 GHz and 2 GHz on the test field to verify its construction and to map its state of the art. Secondly, the same configuration was carried out for the repeated measurements to examine damage caused by the simulated traffic load. In the last step, the prediction of the test field degradation should be evaluated. Here, the first 3D measurement is presented.

One of the main obstacles in optimizing the design of pre-signal system is that driving behaviors in the sorting area cannot be well evaluated. The NaSch model was modified by considering slow probability, turning-deceleration rules, and lane changing rules. It was calibrated with field observed data to explore the interactions among design parameters. The simulation results of the proposed model indicate that the length of sorting area, traffic demand, signal timing, and lane allocation are the most important influence factors. The recommendations of these design parameters are demonstrated. The findings of this paper can be foundations for the design of pre-signal system and show promising improvement in traffic mobility.

In fact, electronic toll collection (ETC) transaction data effectively records operational information of vehicles on freeway, which provides a new method to estimate the travel speed of freeway. First, the paper analyzed the structure of ETC transaction data and presented the data preprocess procedure. Then, a dual-level travel speed calculation model was established under different levels of sample sizes. In order to ensure a sufficient sample size, ETC data of different enter-leave toll plazas pairs which contain more than one road segment were used to calculate the travel speed of every road segment. The reduction coefficient.. and reliable weight theta for sample vehicle speed were introduced in the model. Finally, the model was verified by the special designed field experiments which were conducted on several freeways in Beijing at different time periods. The experiments results demonstrated that the average relative error was about 6.5% which means that the freeway travel speed could be estimated by the proposed model accurately. The proposed model is helpful to promote the level of the freeway operation monitoring and the freeway management, as well as to provide useful information for the freeway travelers.

J	Son, S; Cetin, M; Khattak, A				Son, Sanghoon; Cetin, Mecit; Khattak, Asad			Exploring Bias in Traffic Data Aggregation Resulting from Transition of Traffic States	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW; MODELS	Transportation engineers and researchers heavily use traffic data, which are generally aggregated by predetermined time intervals (e.g., 5 to 15 min). The aggregation process often discards essential information of traffic state transition (e.g., breakdowns). However, the transition of traffic conditions within an aggregation interval is not well understood. This study explored traffic state transition from uncongested to congested regimes that occurred within a predetermined time interval. From two urban freeway locations in Norfolk, Virginia, traffic data archived at 15-min intervals were obtained. A heuristic method based on a Gaussian mixture model was developed to detect the aggregate traffic data that exhibit the transition of traffic states as well as to partition the data statistically into uncongested and congested traffic states. Results show a substantial difference in travel speed (approximately 20 mph) between the two states. In addition, these results illustrate that aggregating these different traffic conditions can cause substantial traffic data aggregation bias by lowering travel speed and flow rates, especially in high traffic flow situations. Finally, new insights into valid traffic data aggregation and speed-flow-concentration relationship development are discussed.

J	Zaki, MH; Sayed, T				Zaki, Mohamed H.; Sayed, Tarek			Automated Analysis of Pedestrians' Nonconforming Behavior and Data Collection at an Urban Crossing	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							COMPUTER VISION; CLASSIFICATION; VIOLATIONS; FRAMEWORK; TRACKING; MODELS	This paper addresses the automated analysis of pedestrians' conformance behavior and data collection in an intersection with a perceived high rate of traffic conflicts involving pedestrians. The intersection is located in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Despite implementation of countermeasures such as reducing the speed limit, safety issues linger at the intersection. The intersection is characterized by a high pedestrian volume and considerable crossing violations by pedestrians, which elevate the safety risk and disrupt vehicle traffic flow. A challenge in performing pedestrian road safety analysis is the shortfall of reliable data. Recent advances in automated detection of pedestrians through the use of computer vision expanded the range of applications in traffic safety. In this study, an automated system for identifying pedestrian crossing nonconformance to traffic regulations by using pattern matching was developed and tested. The results show satisfactory accuracy in detecting both spatial and temporal violations, with the detection rate for violations being more than 84% correct. The automated collection of pedestrian data on crossing speed and counts is also demonstrated with high accuracy. The availability of these data is important for diagnosing the safety issues at the intersection and for justifying capital for implementing pedestrian safety countermeasures.

The control of the car following is essential to its safety and its operational efficiency. For this purpose, this paper builds fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC) system for car following maneuver. The aim of designing of this FSMC system is to obtain a controller that maintain safe longitudinal distance and minimizes the lateral movement of the vehicle with its leader vehicle. These goals were reached by producing proper composite torque and steering angle in car following maneuver. This control system has both advantages of sliding mode and fuzzy logic methods. Also, a nonlinear dynamics model with three degrees of freedom has been used to define sliding surfaces in sliding mode control method. The FSMC's performance was evaluated based on real observed traffic data. The simulation results show that the FSMC controller has a behavior much safer than that of real drivers, and it can provide a pleasant trip for passengers. The designed control system keeps a safe longitudinal distance from its leader and makes much less lateral displacement than the real driver.

It is able to promote a "green revolution" for a smarter mobility and integrated with other sectors of the economy especially with the energy sector. The idea to integrate renewable energy sources, in this case photovoltaic system, with the electric mobility can bring many economic benefits to the environment, both at the urban level and not alone, so much so that it is taken up a route for the future of mobility. The aim of this work describe a possible project of green mobility for a Campus, based on power from renewable sources in order to feed a system of shared transport, in order to optimize traffic flows of vehicles. In this mode, it is possible to have a zero impact of CO2 emissions.

Existing prediction models have proved to be rather accurate in general, but not precise enough during every time interval, and can only obtain the one-step prediction. This paper first presents a Bayesian combined model to forecast the entering and exiting flows at intersections, by integrating a nonlinear regression, a moving average, and an autoregressive model. Based on the forecasted traffic flows, this paper further develops an accurate backpropagation neural network model and an efficient Kalman filtering model to predict the dynamic turning movement proportions. Using Bayesian method with both historical information and currently prediction results for error adjustment, this paper finally integrates both the above two prediction models and proposes a Bi-Bayesian combined framework to achieve both one-step and two-step predictions. A case study is implemented based on practical survey data, which are collected at an intersection in Beijing city, including both historical and current data. The reported prediction results indicate that the Bi-Bayesian combined model is rather accurate and stable for on-line applications.

Such information includes the location, speed, lane and desired driving speed of individual vehicle agents (VA) on a localized roadway. Microscopic traffic simulation studies show that the proposed algorithm can result in both mobility and environmental benefits for the entire traffic system. Specifically, the application of the OLS algorithm reduces the average travel time by up to 3.8% and the fuel consumption by around 2.2%. In addition, the reduction in emissions of criteria pollutants, such as CO, HC, NOx and PM2.5 ranges from 1% to 19%, depending on the congestion level of the roadway segment. Potential extensions of the proposed OLS algorithm are discussed at the end of this paper.

Baker Ridge and Mercer Island tunnels in both directions. This collaboration will make vital improvements for traffic flow on I-90 while preparing the center roadway for Sound Transit's East Link light rail line from Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue and Redmond. The I-90 tunnels were opened to traffic in 1989 with a full transverse ventilation system and 3% AFFF fixed fire suppression system, and the smoke management system improvements for the tunnels are of a vital importance for safe tunnel operation that includes loaded fuel tankers. The design team performed ventilation system tests, suppression system tests, live fire tests, Saccardo nozzle scale modeling tests and CFD analysis to upgrade the existing smoke management systems with minimum construction impact on tunnel operation. The new fire detection system is the key for timely activation of the smoke management systems. Multiple ventilation strategies were adopted to provide an emergency ventilation system capable of addressing smoke and heat from heavy goods or flammable liquids cargo fires including: sectionalization of the existing full transverse ventilation system for the westbound Mt. Baker Ridge tunnel; jet fans for the eastbound Mt. Baker Ridge tunnel and Saccardo nozzles for the Mercer Island tunnels.

At an unsignalized intersection with two one-way traffic flows, it is assumed that two events are independent between vehicles' arrival of major stream and vehicles' arrival of minor stream. The headways of major stream follow M3 distribution. Based on Raff's definition of critical gap, two calculation models are derived, which are named M3 definition model and revised Raff's model. Both models use total rejected coefficient. Different calculation models are compared by simulation and new models are found to be valid. The conclusion reveals that M3 definition model is simple and valid. Revised Raff's model strictly obeys the definition of Raff's critical gap and its application field is more extensive than Raff's model. It can get a more accurate result than the former Raff's model. The M3 definition model and revised Raff's model can derive accordant result.

With the combination of fluid dynamics and vehicle dynamics, we established the Cellular Automata model (referred to as C) for mixed speed two-lane traffic flow on the rule driving on the right side. We also got the relationship among speed, density and traffic though the traffic simulation platform and MatLab numerical simulation. Then we used the method to find out the large bus share rate, the number of vehicles changing lanes and the influence law of safety factors on traffic flow. And we came to a conclusion that the relationship between traffic flow and load are inverted U shape changes in the low load and high load conditions, The conclusion, which provides a theoretical basis for the reasonable organization of expressway traffic management.

It is a microscopic simulation model designed for the analysis of freeways, urban streets, and corridors or networks. The model includes two predecessor models: FRESIM and NETSIM. FRESIM is a microscopic model of freeway traffic, and NETSIM is a model of urban street traffic. CORSIM has a capability simulating a wide range of traffic flow conditions. It is run within a software environment called the Traffic Software Integrated System (TSIS), which provides an integrated, Windows-based interface and environment for executing the model. A key element of TSIS is the TRAFVU output processor, which allows the analyst to view the network graphically and assess its performance using animation. CORSIM is a microscopic simulation model that tracks the position and movement of each vehicle in the network once each second. The purpose of this study is to investigate traffic flow characteristics under "breakdown and recovery condition" through literature reviews and testing such characteristics in CORSIM.

However, most simulation models have limitations in overcapacity demand conditions. When traffic in a congested area "fills" the available roadway space additional traffic demand may never be allowed to enter the network. The intent of this paper is to explore one possible means to address the issue of unserved vehicles in overcapacity conditions using the VISSIM trip chain. The VISSIM trip chain feature is used for this analysis as it has the advantage of not eliminating a vehicle when congestion hinders its entrance onto a network, instead holding the vehicle until an acceptable gap exists on the entry link. A sample network is built to investigate the difference between standard traffic flow inputs and the trip chain method in overcapacity conditions. Also, simulations with different minimum space headway parameters in the priority rules are analyzed, allowing for an initial investigation into the sensitivity of the model to this parameter. Based on the analysis conducted it is concluded that, with appropriate calibrations, the trip chain feature in VISSIM is a potentially useful method to provide realistic modeling of various overcapacity conditions.

The NaSch rule is adopted to represent vehicle movements on road sections. Two novel rules are proposed to move the vehicles in intersection areas, and an additional rule is developed to avoid the "gridlock" phenomenon. Simulation results show that the network fundamental diagram is very similar to that of road traffic flow. We found that the randomization probability and the maximum vehicle speed have significant impact on network traffic mobility for free-flow state. Their effect may be weak when the network is congested.

J	Manzo, S; Nielsen, OA; Prato, CG				Manzo, Stefano; Nielsen, Otto Anker; Prato, Carlo Giacomo			Effects of Uncertainty in Speed-Flow Curve Parameters on a Large-Scale Model Case Study of the Danish National Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Uncertainty is inherent in transportmodels and prevents the use of a deterministic approach when traffic is modeled. Quantifying uncertainty thus becomes an indispensable step to produce a more informative and reliable output of transport models. In traffic assignment models, volume-delay functions express travel time as a function of traffic flows and the theoretical capacity of the modeled facility. The U.S. Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) formula is one of the most extensively applied volume delay functions in practice. This study investigated uncertainty in the BPR parameters. Initially, BPR parameters were estimated by analyzing observed traffic data related to the Danish highway network. Then, BPR parameter distributions were generated by using the resampling bootstrap technique. Finally, the generated parameter vectors were used to implement sensitivity tests on the four-stage Danish national transport model. The results clearly highlight the importance to modeling purposes of taking into account BPR formula parameter uncertainty, expressed as a distribution of values rather than assumed point values. Indeed, the model output demonstrates a noticeable sensitivity to parameter uncertainty. This aspect is evident particularly for stretches of the network with a high number of competing routes. Model sensitivity was also tested for BPR parameter uncertainty combined with link capacity uncertainty. The resultant increase in model sensitivity demonstrates even further the importance of implementing uncertainty analysis as part of a robust transport modeling process.

Based on multi-agents model, the fined solution is designed to help drivers in finding a parking space at anytime and anywhere. Three services are offered: the search for a vacant place, directions to a parking space and booking a place for parking. The results of this study generated by the platform MATSim transport simulation, show that our approach optimizes the operation of vehicles in a parking need with the aim of reducing congestion, and improve traffic flow in urban area. A comparison between the first method where the vehicles are random and the second method where vehicles are steered to vacant parking spaces shows that the minimization of time looking for a parking space could improve circulation by reducing the number of cars in the morning of 2% and 0.7% of the evening. In addition, the traffic per hour per day was reduced by approximately 4.17%.

Catastrophe theory was generally used to explore the mathematical relationships among the traffic data collected from highway conditions, which could not be appropriate for the urban expressway conditions. Traffic flow data collected from the 3rd ring road expressway in Beijing was used to build flow-density model and speed-density Greenshields model. Then the density was discussed based on the traffic wave speed function with cusp catastrophe theory; in particular, density conditions on median lanes and shoulder lanes were deeply discussed. Meanwhile the chaotic characteristics were analyzed based on the traffic temporal sequence data collected from 29 detectors located at the 3rd ring road expressway, and C-C method was used to reconstruct the phase space and the largest Lyapunov exponents were estimated by Wolf method and the small data sets method. The results indicated that the traffic operation catastrophe density on the median lanes was a bit higher than that on the shoulder lanes; additionally chaotic characteristics obviously existed in the local corridor composed of 29 detectors in the 3rd ring road expressway traffic flow system.

Main reasons of ITS development are related with need to establish sustainable transport systems concept, as it is declared by EU guidelines as the only way for development of future transport system. Here must be understood that different aspects of transportation could be covered, at example: management of urban traffic flows; optimization of transportation process (logistics area); green technologies in vehicles, transport flow management and etc. In frame of the research the first mentioned above case will be discussed. The first case-study is based on application of sensor technologies for collecting data about traffic flows. The obtained information could be usefully integrated in existing management of traffic flows structure from single traffic control center. More over obtained data could be used as a source of data for modeling of different traffic management alternatives. In this case model will be based on the short-term forecasting tool. Here is necessary to combine four elements of the system: sensor technologies, data transferring, simulation of traffic flows and decision making. Also the integration different additional services in the single system are important for system flexibility. In frame of current research the concept of the on-line traffic management system is developed.	[Patlins, A.; Kunicina, N.; Adrian, L.

Various traffic phenomena near ramps can be described by the Cell Transmission Model (CTM). However, real traffic data shows that traffic flow characteristics are far different for the ramp system with different ramp distances. We analyze traffic characteristics of ramp system with both an on-ramp and an off-ramp in Beijing 3rd ring road firstly. Then, it is found that ramp distance between the on-ramp and the off-ramp has a great impact on the capacity, due to the conflict of traffic flow between on-ramp and off-ramp. Finally the traffic conflict is considered in the merge cell and Capacity Drop CTM (CD-CTM) is proposed to embody the conflict. The simulation results suggest that CD-CTM fits the empirical data from Beijing 3rd ring road. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With the availability of traffic data in nowadays, the traffic data is popularly considered to apply for the validation of demand models. It is a crucial step for convincing the model prediction results. The flow-density model, which provides relationships between traffic flow variables, is a well-established approach for traffic prediction. Robust implementations of long-range planning and microsimulation models require calibration and validation of facility and time-dependent parameters (e. g. free flow speed, capacity, wave speed, critical density) which are sensitive to infrastructure, weather and other external factors. Archived data from freeway sensors provide a large sample from which to calibrate these parameters. In this paper, a set of automated traffic state identification tool is developed and applied to historical data to automatically determine the traffic phases. Once the traffic phase is known, we then calibrate the flow-density parameters with the fundamental diagram. Using this tool, with the identified traffic state for many days' data, the traffic parameters for free flow state and congestion state can be calibrated automatically in a fundamental diagram. As a case study, the calibrated traffic parameters in a dynamic traffic model (Cell Transmission Model) CTM are presented. The main findings of this paper is that an automated parameter calibration method is applicable for practical use, and this method provides a convincing result. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The system with an on-ramp and an off-ramp is regarded as the typical scenario to study the effect of the relative location of on-ramp and off-ramp. The system can be classified into two types, the case with an upstream on-ramp and that with a downstream on-ramp. CTM (Cell Transmission Model) is used to model the system and calibrated by the data from the Beijing 3rd ring road. The results show traffic flow characteristics in the two systems are far different. Especially, for the system with a downstream on-ramp, main road has the priority in the merge area, and CTM cannot describe traffic characteristics.

In general, they have conflict with each other. Tradable credits scheme is proved an effective method in Environmental Science. Now more and more scholars introduce it into traffic. Because it possesses the advantages that other methods do not have in alleviating congestion and reducing emissions. In this paper we indicate there always exists a tradable credits scheme that induces a traffic flow distribution with minimum emissions. We proved a given target feasible link flow pattern can be decentralized into user equilibrium by a tradable credits scheme, and sought tradable credits schemes for Pareto-efficient control and management of both traffic congestion and emissions on road networks. There are two models which could describe the Pareto-efficient problem between alleviating congestion and reducing emissions, i.e., bi-level congestion pricing model and weighting problem model. When the emission function is an increasing function, any Pareto-efficient flow pattern can be supported as an user equilibrium by the tradable credit scheme. If the emission function is a non-monotonic function, we divided the network into two cases: loops-free network and loops network which satisfies Gallager's sense. In a loop-free road network, any feasible link flow pattern can be decentralized into user equilibrium by a tradable scheme. In loops network, Pareto-efficient solution may not be decentralized to user equilibrium by tradable credits scheme. However, if the loops network doesn't satisfy Gallager's sense, any feasible Pareto-efficient link flow pattern can be decentralized into user equilibrium by a nonnegative toll scheme/tradable credits scheme. On the contrary, it wouldn't. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

As known, when the downstream section is free flow, the congestion for every bottleneck section starts from the bottleneck cell, and then gradually propagates towards its upstream. Many studies about bottlenecks are based on the assumption that the downstream of each bottleneck is free flow. In this paper, we have investigated ramp systems with the congested downstream. Based on the cell transmission model, a tri-cell ramp system with two bottlenecks is used as an example to explore what the convergence state of the bottleneck section is under the congested downstream section. Three cases have been studied: free-flow downstream, middle-state downstream, and the most congested downstream, and the different convergence states. The results show that 1) if the downstream of the bottleneck is the most congested, the upstream bottleneck section converges to the most congested state no matter what the initial state is; 2) if the downstream is congested, the upstream section converges to congested states, and the degree of congestion in the upstream section increases with; 3) the larger the density in the congested downstream is, the more congested the final state of the ramp system is.

This study is necessary to model the changes in the shape of the vehicle platoons at different sections along the road. It is need to understand these changes in order to define an adequate programming of the traffic light phases. The study started from a survey of traffic flows on a road section of about 650 m.: all vehicles have been followed from the start section and for each of them were recorded the transit times on next sections at known distance. The data have been analyzed with two different methods: Cyclic Flow Profiles and the Weibull distribution. The calibrated CFP, with correct parameter values, well represent the trend and the dispersion of vehicle platoons at the observed road section. The Weibull distribution, basic used to describe life-time reliability characteristics in model failure testing, can be a powerful tool also for the prediction of vehicle platoons on the road sections. Fact, starting from the flow study in a number of sections, it is possible to know the trend of distribution parameters as function of the start distance. The variation of two parameters along the road from the first section (first signal light) appears to be linear for the first parameter (position), almost linear for the second (form).

Real-time and reliability of short-term traffic flow forecasting is directly related to traffic management and collaborative control. There are various methods that have been established to forecast traffic flow, but most of the forecasting models are constructed according to analysis of the historical and current traffic flow series in selected sections or crossings, without considering the dynamic information of related traffic network. According to the traffic flow characters of junction of isomerism road network system, the paper analyzes the relationship between the traffic flow of a certain section with other section's flow, and calculates the dynamic correlation coefficient. Following, the paper selects input variables, and establishes the Radial Basic Function (RBF) neural network model for prediction on the basis of dynamic correlation coefficient. Finally, the paper takes the G2 freeway and Beijing road network that consists of the junction of isomerism road network as an example to forecast the short-term traffic flow. The result of forecasting is very accurate, and the relative errors are within the 15%. It indicates that the model could be used to forecast the short-term traffic flow for junction of isomerism road network system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The congestion can be lessening by employing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS). ITS systems have been demonstrated and implemented in few advanced countries. For an example, the technology of Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) in Japan has completely eliminated the traffic congestion ahead of toll gates and has reduced CO2 emission by 130000 ton-per-year. Recently, an ATIS system so called Floating Car Data (FCD) technique has received many attentions due to its cost-effectiveness and wide coverage in comparison to traditional systems in providing real-time traffic information. The success of the technique is made possible with the existing and vast coverage of the wireless network and information technology. In regard to FCD technique, although many publications have discussed various issues, none has elaborated the traffic data discrepancy between that provided by the FCD technique and the actual traffic data. This paper discusses the issue and demonstrates that there is an optimum averaging time interval in the FCD technique such that the data recorded by a probe vehicle can reasonably predict the traffic data. The analysis is based on experimental data recorded by Sugiyama et al. (2008) where 22 vehicles were deployed to establish a platoon of vehicles moving in a circular road having 230 m perimeter length. Various averaging time intervals are studied, and one that provides the best estimate of the traffic flow is selected as the optimum averaging time interval. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

It means there are no steady states of congested traffic and contradicts with the fundamental diagram approach and three-phase traffic flow theory both of which admit the existence of steady states of congested traffic. In order to verify this assumption, a cellular automaton model with non-hypothetical congested steady state is proposed, which is based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model with additional slow-to-start and the effective desired space gap. Simulations show that this new model can produce the synchronized flow, the transitions from free flow to synchronized flow to wide moving jams, and multiple congested patterns observed by the three-phase theory.

Discovery of hot routes is important to the applications that requiring classifies the traffic flow or profiles the dynamic of the city, such as targeted advertising, traffic management and control. The advances of location-acquisition technologies have led to a huge collection of objects' trajectories in the road network, which give us the chances to finding hot routes conveniently. However, it is difficult to effectively detect hot routes without the support of the available road map. To address this issue, we first develop a Road Network Constructing Algorithm (RNCA) that extract road network from vehicular trajectories using image processing methods, and then propose a Hot Route Inferring Algorithm (HRRA) based on the extracted road network. Meanwhile, a novel road matching operation is also developed to match trajectory points onto roads. We have conducted extensive experiments on real dataset of taxi trajectories. Simulation results show that the proposed RNCA and HRRA are both effective and efficient.

Such road infrastructure needs constant attention in terms of traffic monitoring as even a single disaster on a major artery will disrupt the way of life. Humans cannot be expected to monitor these massive infrastructures over 24/7 and computer vision is increasingly being used to develop automated strategies to notify the human observers of any impending slowdowns and traffic bottlenecks. However, due to extreme costs associated with the current state of the art computer vision based networked monitoring systems, innovative computer vision based systems can be developed which are standalone and efficient in analyzing the traffic flow and tracking vehicles for speed detection. In this article, a traffic monitoring system is suggested that counts vehicles and tracks their speeds in realtime for multi-track freeways in Australia. Proposed algorithm uses Gaussian mixture model for detection of foreground and is capable of tracking the vehicle trajectory and extracts the useful traffic information for vehicle counting. This stationary surveillance system uses a fixed position overhead camera to monitor traffic.

Variable Speed Limit Control Strategy with Collision Probability Assessments Based on Traffic State Prediction	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SAFETY; FREEWAYS; IMPACTS	An increasing number of vehicles on roadways has made traffic safety a serious challenge for transportation engineers. For the mitigation of traffic safety concerns, a variety of active traffic control measures, such as the variable speed limit (VSL), have been intensively investigated and deployed. VSL is usually adopted to advise drivers of a lower speed limit that is more appropriate to a congested traffic condition and takes advantage of the homogeneous traffic flow effect. However, in earlier studies, because of the absence of traffic state prediction, the impact of applied VSL control was not quantitatively analyzed. In this study, a model predictive control framework was adopted for predicting and assessing future traffic states. Taking into consideration the impact of VSL control, the study used a macroscopic traffic flow model. The collision probabilities of the predicted traffic states were assessed with a precursor-based collision prediction model to determine the optimized control signal. With this design, the proposed algorithm controller provided a robust method for determining the VSL control plan to optimize safety performance over a traffic network. The proposed control algorithm was evaluated with a simulation study based on field data that was conducted to reproduce a major ring road in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The proposed algorithm was used to implement VSL control on the studied 11-km freeway stretch. The proposed algorithm control scenario was then compared with the uncontrolled scenario. The evaluation proved that the proposed VSL control algorithm could effectively reduce the probability for collisions in a congested traffic network without significantly compromising mobility.

In this paper, we analysis the influence on green wave tape by queue length of vehicles through congestion data and sensor data on road, draw a queue dissipated model and import it into MAXBAND model. Then present a complex-arterial network mathematical programming model based on the improved MAXBAND model. The complex-arterial networks mathematical programming model can make all the intersectant arterials in the network under green wave tape control. Simulate in vissim simulation software with different vehicle flow data.

Therefore, it is necessary to study green band with turnings in the zone traffic signal coordination control. This article focuses on the method which could compute the optimal route for an extra traffic flow of commuters and set the green band in a square area of 4*3 intersections, given the basic information of road conditions, traffic volume, split setting, etc. In the simulation, this article uses the data from Huilongguan area in Beijing. Using the Synchro to simulate the road network, it distributes the traffic flow of commuters into four routes respectively and gets the reports of network performance after simulation of each situation. The reports shows that the optimal route, which performs better in the measure of effectiveness, such as delay per vehicle, stops delay per vehicle, speed, fuel combustion efficiency, width of green band, bandwidth efficiency, is exactly consistent with the results calculated by Rout-Choice model.

If the traffic flow prediction real time capability is not strong enough, the prediction outcomes will become uncertain. The adaptive particle filter algorithm suggested in this paper is based on confidence level. And this algorithm can adaptively adjust the number of the particles according to the state of the particles and reduce the quantity of the particle filter algorithm calculation so as to improve the real time capability, on the condition of guaranteeing the algorithm precision. The experiment results have verified the effectiveness of the method.

The SOM was constructed in such a way that the prototype vectors represented vehicle-following stimuli (the follower's velocity, relative velocity, and gap) while the output signals represented the response (the follower's acceleration). Vehicle trajectories collected at a northbound segment of Interstate 80 Freeway at Emeryville, CA, were used to train the SOM. The trajectory information of two selected pairs of passenger cars was then fed into the trained SOM to identify similar stimuli experienced by the followers. The observed responses, when the stimuli were classified by the SOM into the same category, were compared to discover the interdriver heterogeneity. The acceleration profile of another passenger car was analyzed in the same fashion to observe the interdriver heterogeneity. The distribution of responses derived from data sets of car-following-car and car-following-truck, respectively, was compared to ascertain inter-vehicle-type heterogeneity.

Numerical tools exist to help road managers to organize services and consequently to trigger de-icing operations. Forecasting strategies have been commonplace since the 1980s, and often based on numerical models. Traffic is one of the influencing parameters, specifically in urban areas. This work was undertaken to evaluate to which extent an accurate description of traffic might improve numerical model dedicated to road surface temperature forecasting. Two sets of experiments were run to detect and to quantify traffic effects on RST. First one consisted in driving above an infrared radiometer, a pyrgeometer and other atmospheric probes to measure the radiative contribution of a passing vehicle at various speeds. In the second set, an infrared camera was installed on a vehicle in an urban traffic flow. This camera was mounted on the roof and focused the pavement right behind the vehicle ahead, both circulating at the same speed. Infrared thermography indicated a fleeting contribution of traffic to RST. The temperature increase in circulated areas, with respect to uncirculated ones, does not last according to collected measurements. Measurements with atmospheric and radiometric probes provided elements to properly take into account traffic in a numerical model and to appreciate its contribution.

Exploring Areawide Dynamics of Pedestrian Crowds Three-Dimensional Approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MODEL; MOVEMENT; FLOW	The main objectives of this paper are to evaluate existing measurement methods of pedestrian traffic flow and to propose a three-dimensional approach that extends Edie's definitions of fundamental traffic variables to multidirectional walking areas by using three-dimensional pedestrian trajectories. Pedestrian crowds have an areawide fundamental diagram that is similar to a network fundamental diagram of vehicular traffic. Pedestrian traffic in a multidirectional area exhibits hysteretic behavior similar to that of some other many-particle physical systems. Some of the underlying dynamics of bidirectional pedestrian streams are explored with empirical data. Pedestrian streams behave somewhat differently from ordinary fluids with regard to the viscosity concept in the models based on fluid dynamics. The velocity profile for both unidirectional and bidirectional pedestrian streams is hyperbolic (with higher values on the boundaries and lower values in the middle), opposite that of fluids. The formation and dissipation of self-organized pedestrian lanes also are explored. A modification to Helbing's social force model is proposed with regard to the attractive force between pedestrians.

Empirical data were collected by extracting trajectories from merging vehicles and adjacent vehicles at two on-ramp bottlenecks in Shanghai, China. These data included 58 normal (free-flow) lane changes (NLCs), 36 cooperative lane changes (CLCs), 135 forced lane changes (FLCs), and 188 unsuccessful lane changes (USLCs). The objective was to develop and compare five discrete choice models (two multinomial logit and three nested logit) to understand merging behavior at on-ramp bottlenecks better. Estimation results showed that the two-level nested logit model considering three merging types (NLC, CLC, and FLC) provided the best fit. The traffic flow condition (bottleneck), the time gap and the space gap of the lag vehicle, and the speed of the merging vehicle were key factors when choosing merging types. The resulting quantitative models can be used to perform a microscopic analysis of the breakdown mechanism and develop a traffic simulation model.

A promising avenue for proactive traffic management is the prediction of near-future traffic conditions in real time by using a traffic flow model. Important calibration parameters of such a model include boundary flows (i.e., amount of traffic expected to enter the network during the prediction horizon). A boundary flow prediction method is proposed that combines the most recent traffic data with historical traffic data. An autoregressive moving average with an exogenous input (ARMAX) model is estimated online with the most recent vehicle detector station data. An optimal multiple-step-ahead predictor of traffic demand is obtained from the estimated ARMAX model by solving a corresponding Bezout equation for each predictor. Results obtained with empirical data collected along a freeway mainline and an on-ramp indicate that this method outperforms prediction methods that rely on only the historical average of the data, especially during days with unusual traffic flow demands, such as a Super Bowl Sunday. The simplicity and robustness make this method useful in practical applications.

Multiscale Traffic Flow Modeling in Mixed Networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; WAVES; BEHAVIOR	Multiscale traffic flow modeling, which combines traffic models of different scales (e.g., of network and traffic representation), offers many opportunities for the simulation and evaluation of traffic measures and policies in large networks. For example, macroscopic continuum models of traffic flow could be used to simulate the propagation of traffic on large freeway corridors and networks efficiently and parsimoniously, whereas microscopic models of traffic flow could be used to simulate those parts of the network where more detail (e.g., lateral behavior) is required, such as at intersections and toll plazas. One key requirement of such a multiscale framework is related to the interface between models of different scales. This interface should ensure consistency in (a) vehicle conservation and (b) vehicle and traveler properties that must be transported over this interface (e.g., vehicle type, occupancy, and destination). In the approach presented, both types of consistency problems can be solved simultaneously, and this approach is illustrated with an integrated example. This multiscale modeling framework enables the coupling of any macroscopic model with any microscopic model (and vice versa) without putting constraints on the internal structure or parameterization in either model.

A unified representation with a parsimonious explanation for traffic observations under free-flow, congested, and dynamic transient conditions is developed by capturing the essential characteristics of forward and backward wave propagation through cumulative flow count variables. New formulations are presented to use Bluetooth vehicle identification records and GPS vehicle location data on a freeway corridor with a merge and diverge. With the addition of nonnegativity and maximum discharge rate constraints, a computationally efficient linear programming model is constructed to estimate traffic states (i.e., density and traffic flow) from cumulative flow counts at each second. The proposed model is implemented and tested systematically on the basis of a real-world next generation simulation (NGSIM) data set.

To efficiently manage traffic flows, in this paper, we compare the effectiveness of two well-known vehicle routing algorithms: the Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and the A* (Astar) algorithm in terms of the total travel time and the travel distance. To this end, we built a generic ITS test-bed and created several real-world driving scenarios using field and simulation data to evaluate the performance of these two routing algorithms. The dataset used in our simulation is six weeks traffic volume data from 08/01/2012 to 09/27/2012 in the Maryland (MD)/Washington DC and Virginia (VA) area. Our simulation data shows that an increase in network size results in scalability problems as the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms diminishes in larger road networks with greater traffic volume densities, flow rates, and congested conditions. In addition, the imprecision of the road network increases as the network size and the traffic volume density increases. Our study shows that the ability of these vehicular routing algorithms to adaptively route traffic depends on the size and type of road networks, and the current roadway conditions.

Generalized Edie's definitions of fundamental traffic flow variables along highways are extended for considering vehicles traveling in networks. These definitions are used to characterize traffic flow in networks and form the basis for estimating relationships among network density, flow, and speed in the form of a network fundamental diagram. The method relies on three-dimensional vehicle trajectories to provide estimates of network flow, density, and speed. Such trajectories may be routinely obtained from particle-based microscopic and mesoscopic simulation models and are increasingly available from tracking devices on vehicles. Numerical results from the simulation of two networks, in Chicago, Illinois, and Salt Lake City, Utah, are presented to illustrate and validate the estimation methodology. As part of the verification process, the study confirms that the traffic flow fundamental identity (Q = K . V) holds at the network level only when networkwide traffic flow variables are defined consistently with Edie's definitions.

The structure of the evacuation demand can significantly affect network performance. A radial-shaped structure results in a more stable network recovery compared with a directional evacuation structure. This study confirms the existence of unloading reloading hysteresis when a network is subject to successive cycles of loading and unloading. If a network undergoes a complete or near-complete recovery, the reloading path in the NFD follows almost the same path as in the initial loading. Results suggest that the linear relationship between average network flow and trip completion rate does not always hold, as previously thought. The relationship becomes highly scattered and nonlinear when the network is highly congested and under disruption and the number of adaptive drivers is sufficiently large. Frequent route switching by adaptive drivers can artificially increase the average network flow but does not necessarily increase the network output (trip completion rate). Adaptive driving increases fluctuations in the NFD; however, it reduces hysteresis and gridlock while increasing network capacity.

The asymmetric cell transmission model (ACTM) is a widely accepted macroscopic model integrated into a variety of freeway traffic control frameworks. The model is based on the original cell transmission model; modified merge equations make it computationally tractable for optimization of ramp metering. However, when the common simplistic calibration of the model is used, an infeasible merging behavior is observed at uncontrolled merges, and the resulting queue lengths are not accurately estimated. This paper proposes an elegant analytical relationship, based on traffic flow theory, for calibrating the two parameters involved in the ACTM merge model. The method ensures the physical consistency of the dynamics involved in queue processes in the proximity of a noncontrolled merge junction. This method should be an essential feature of any freeway traffic model.

The model takes into account heterogeneity of driver-vehicle units with respect to speed and space occupancy: long vehicles with large headways (e.g., trucks) take more space than short vehicles with short headways (e.g., passenger cars). What makes the model unique is that it considers that this effect is larger when traffic volume is greater. This state-dependent space occupancy is reflected in dynamic passenger car equivalent values. The resulting model is shown to satisfy important requirements, such as providing a unique solution and being anisotropic. Simulations compare Fast lane to other multiclass models. The characteristic velocity is shown to depend on the truck share, which is one of the main consequences of the modeling approach.

J	Wu, N; Geistefeldt, J				Wu, Ning; Geistefeldt, Justin			Modeling Reliability in Freeway Networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The stochastic nature of freeway capacity typically has been analyzed at specific points that are considered bottlenecks. The stochastic relationship between the adjacent bottlenecks has not been taken into account. This paper introduces a concept for the stochastic interpretation of capacity and breakdown probability within a larger freeway network consisting of several combined bottlenecks. The presented stochastic methodology delivers a theoretical average capacity and the probability of breakdown for freeway segments of different lengths. The methodology can also be used to identify the effects of consecutive freeway segments and bottlenecks such as on-ramps, off-ramps, and weaving areas having different characteristics. The proposed method makes it possible to determine the breakdown probability as a function of the average volume or density. Hence, the risk of traffic flow disturbance along a freeway segment or within a freeway network can be analyzed.

Real-time panorama is conducive to timely treat traffic accidents and to greatly improve traffic capacity. This paper designs a 3D road scene monitoring framework based on real-time panorama. The system is the combination of large scale panorama, satellite map textures, and 3D scene model, in which users can ramble freely. This paper has the following contributions. Firstly, land-points were extracted followed by motion detection, then comotion algorithm was applied to land-points from adjacent cameras, and homography matrix was constructed. Secondly, reference camera was chosen and transformed to overhead viewpoint; subsequently multiviews were morphed to the same viewpoint and stitched to panorama. Finally, the registration based on high-precision GPS information between 2D road panorama and 3D scene model was also proposed. The proposed framework has been successfully applied to a large road intersection monitoring. Experimental results are furnished at the end of the paper.

The system comprises probe vehicle detection sensors, fixed detection sensors, and traffic state assessment algorithm. First of all, the validity checking of the traffic flow data is taken as preprocessing of this method. And then a new method based on the history data information is proposed to fuse and recover the incomplete data. According to the characteristics of space complementary of data based on the probe vehicle detector and fixed detector, a fusion model of space matching is presented to estimate the mean travel speed of the road. Finally, the traffic flow data include flow, speed and, occupancy rate, which are detected between Beijing Deshengmen bridge and Drum Tower bridge, are fused to assess the traffic state of the road by using the fusion decision model of rough sets and cloud. The accuracy of experiment result can reach more than 98%, and the result is in accordance with the actual road traffic state. This system is effective to assess traffic state, and it is suitable for the urban intelligent transportation system.

Building an efficient mass transportation system is clearly necessary. However, implementing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have also been demonstrated effective in various advanced countries. Recently, the floating vehicle technique (FVT), an ITS implementation, has become cost effective to provide real-time traffic information with proliferation of the smartphones. Although many publications have discussed various issues related to the technique, none of them elaborates the discrepancy of a single floating car data (FCD) and the associated fleet data. This work addresses the issue based on an analysis of Sugiyama et al's experimental data. The results indicate that there is an optimum averaging time interval such that the estimated velocity by the FVT reasonably representing the traffic velocity.

In order to provide continuous monitoring and prompt anomaly detection, an abstract-level autonomous anomaly detection model is developed that is able to detect various categories of abnormal vehicle events with unsupervised learning. The method is based on the cogent confabulation model, which performs statistical inference functions in a neuromorphic formulation. The proposed approach covers the partitioning of a large region, training of the vehicle behavior knowledge base and the detection of anomalies according to the likelihood-ratio test. A software version of the system is implemented to verify the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate the functionality of the detection model and compare the system performance under different configurations.

Since traffic has become an important aspect of our lives, understanding traffic system and how it interacts with various factors is essential. In this paper, the interactions between traffic flow and road topology will be studied, particularly the relationship between a sharp bend in a road segment and traffic jams. As suggested by Sugiyama[1], when car density exceeds a critical density, the fluctuations in the speed of each car will lead to greater fluctuations in speed of the cars behind it. This enhancement of fluctuation leads to the congestion of vehicles. Using a cellular automata model modified from Nagel-Schreckenberg Cellular Automata model[2], the simulation results suggest that the mechanism of traffic jam at bottlenecks is similar to this. Instead of directly causing the congestion in cars, bottleneck on roads only causes the local density of traffic to increase. The resultant congestion is still due to the enhancement of fluctuations. Results of this study opened up a large number of possible analytical studies that could be used as grounds for future works.

Therefore, a road segment-based emission model for estimating light duty vehicle emissions is proposed, where floating car technology is used to collect information of traffic condition of roads. The employed analysis framework consists of three major modules: the Average Speed and the Average Acceleration Module (ASAAM), the Traffic Flow Estimation Module (TFEM) and the Traffic Emission Module (TEM). The ASAAM is used to obtain the average speed and the average acceleration of the fleet on each road segment using FCD. The TFEM is designed to estimate the traffic flow of each road segment in a given period, based on the speed-flow relationship and traffic flow spatial distribution Finally, the TEM estimates emissions from each road segment, based on the results of previous two modules. Hourly on-road light-duty vehicle emissions for each road segment in Shenzhen's traffic network are obtained using this analysis framework. The temporal-spatial distribution patterns of the pollutant emissions of road segments are also summarized The results show high emission road segments cluster in several important regions in Shenzhen. Also, road segments emit more emissions during rush hours than other periods. The presented case study demonstrates that the proposed approach is feasible and easy-to-use to help planners make informed decisions by providing detailed road segment-based emission information.

This study is based on monitoring data of operational traffic obtained from a Weight in Motion (WIM) system. First, according to configuration of vehicles, all vehicles were classified into 14 categories out of which 6 categories were selected as the chief categories of fatigue traffic loads. Then, the statistical distributions of traffic-flow parameters, including vehicle weight, vehicle spacing, traffic volume allocated to each lane, axle weights and spacing, were studied. Finally, fatigue damage equivalent model vehicles for the vehicle categories were derived from the distribution of weights and spacing of axles on the principle of equivalent fatigue damage.

These aging bridge structures have experienced increasing traffic volume and weight, deteriorating components, as well as a large number of stress cycles. This paper presents a case study of fatigue assessment of an interstate highway steel bridge through real time monitoring under traffic. The bridge is a single-span, composite steel I-girder structure with K-type cross frame diaphragms. The study also included numerical analysis using 3D global and local finite element models. Based on the simulated traffic flow, statistical dynamic responses such as displacements and stress-ranges of bridge girders were studied for the cause of fatigue cracks that occurred in some cross frame connections. Meanwhile, long-term field monitoring has also been conducted. Based on the information from field tests, simulated numerical analytical results were verified. Thus, the performance of highway bridges under truck load can be predicted in a more realistic way to estimate the fatigue performance of highway bridges.	[Fu, C.

In order to get the strain-time history data, strain gauge and dynamic data acquisition system have been used, and then was translated into stress time history data. The stress spectrum of 24 hours processed by rain-flow counting method, and used the related regulation of fatigue to evaluate the fatigue life. A fine model was established by the large-scale finite element software to carry out finite element analysis. The results of measuring analyses show that the stress amplitude of fast traffic lane and slow traffic lane are 70MPa and 110MPa respectively, which exceed the fatigue limit of U-rib butt weld, it will easy to failure under the accumulation of the vehicle cyclic loading. The results of finite element analyses show that the heavier vehicles produced more serious fatigue damage, the over-load vehicles should be controlled strictly. Both the finite element simulation and the measured analysis show that the slow traffic lane will be fatigue failure under the present traffic flow, it should pay more attention to there.	[Ji, B.

In cloud computing environment, firstly, SVM parameters are optimized by the parallel genetic algorithm, and then this optimized parallel SVM model is used to predict traffic flow. On the basis of the traffic flow data of Haizhu District in Guangzhou City, the proposed model was verified and compared with the serial GA-SVM model and parallel GA-SVM model based on MPI (message passing interface). The results demonstrate that the parallel GA-SVM model based on cloud computing has higher prediction accuracy, shorter running time, and higher speedup.

This paper proposes a novel method to detect the lane center via rapid extraction and high accuracy clustering of vehicle motion trajectories. First, we use the activity map to realize automatically the extraction of road region, the calibration of dynamic camera, and the setting of three virtual detecting lines. Secondly, the three virtual detecting lines and a local background model with traffic flow feedback are used to extract and group vehicle feature points in unit of vehicle. Then, the feature point groups are described accurately by edge weighted dynamic graph and modified by a motion-similarity Kalman filter during the sparse feature point tracking. After obtaining the vehicle trajectories, a rough k-means incremental clustering with Hausdorff distance is designed to realize the rapid online extraction of lane center with high accuracy. The use of rough set reduces effectively the accuracy decrease, which results from the trajectories that run irregularly. Experimental results prove that the proposed method can detect lane center position efficiently, the affected time of subsequent tasks can be reduced obviously, and the safety of traffic surveillance systems can be enhanced significantly.

Optimal and robust strategies for freeway traffic management under demand and supply uncertainties: an overview and general theory	TRANSPORTMETRICA A-TRANSPORT SCIENCE			English	Article						optimal traffic management; stochastic dynamic programming; robustness; approximate dynamic programming; ramp metering; dynamic pricing	LINEAR-QUADRATIC REGULATORS; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; MOTORWAY NETWORKS; AGENT TECHNOLOGY; STOCHASTIC-MODEL; FLOW; EQUILIBRIUM; CALIBRATION; CONGESTION	This paper investigates optimal decision-making for traffic management under demand and supply uncertainties by stochastic dynamic programming. Traffic flow dynamics under demand and supply uncertainties is described by a simplified version of the stochastic cell transmission model. Based on this model, the optimal traffic management problem is analysed wherein the existence of solution is guaranteed by verifying the well-posed condition. An analytical optimal control law is derived in terms of a set of coupled generalised recursive Riccati equations. As optimal control laws may be fragile with respect to model misspecification, a robust (optimal) decision-making law that aims to act robust with respect to the parameter misspecification in the traffic flow model (which can be originated from model calibration), and to attenuate the effect of disturbances in freeway networks (wherein demand uncertainty is usually regarded as a kind of disturbance) is proposed. Conventionally, network uncertainties have been considered to induce negative effects on traffic management in transportation literature. In contrast, the proposed methodology outlines an interesting issue that is to make benefit (or trade-off) from the inherent network uncertainties. Finally, some practical issues in traffic management that can be addressed by extending the current framework are briefly discussed.	[Zhong, R.

The model is an extension of the full velocity difference (FVD) model by taking into account the lane changing. The extended lane-changing rules are presented to model the lane-changing behaviour. The cases that the car accidents occupy the exterior or interior lane, the medium lane, and two lanes are studied by numerical simulations. The time-space diagrams and the current diagrams are presented, and the traffic jams are investigated. The results show that the car accident has a different effect on the traffic flow when it occupies different lanes. The car accidents have a more serious effect on the whole road when they occupy two lanes. The larger the density is, the greater the influence on the traffic flow becomes.

J	Chang, B; Phares, BM; Zou, H; Couch, T				Chang, Byungik; Phares, Brent M.; Zou, Hao; Couch, Todd			Thermal Analysis of Highway Overhead Support Structures	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Dynamic message signs are increasingly used on freeways, expressways, and major arterials to manage traffic flow better by providing accurate and timely information to drivers. Overhead truss structures that allow for wide displays across multiple travel lanes are typically used to support those signs. Recently, cracks at welded toes in these structures have been identified in multiple states. The AASHTO standard specification defines the loads to be considered during design as wind load, dead load, live load, and ice load, and fatigue design for wind galloping, vortex shedding, natural wind gust, and truck-induced gust. Notably missing from this list is any consideration for thermal loads. Although the number of thermal cycles is relatively low, the temperature variations are relatively large. Should these large temperature ranges result in large stresses, the potential for fatigue failures to initiate, principally from thermal variations, exists. The objectives of this study were to investigate the influence of thermal- and wind-induced loads on bridge-type overhead truss support structures and to provide a resource aimed at improving current design specifications for thermal design. To provide a solid baseline for this work, field monitoring of several overhead trusses was conducted. The evaluation of the collected data was important for understanding the structural behavior and for the advancement of any future code provisions. In addition, finite element modeling was conducted to further study strain and stress magnitudes, which were compared with the field monitoring data. The fatigue life of the truss structures was also estimated on the basis of AASHTO specifications and the numerical modeling results.

The influences of heavy vehicles on lane-changing are analyzed. An improved accumulated speed benefit model is proposed in which drivers generate lane-changing intentions based on accumulated speed benefit of preceding vehicle in target lane over the preceding vehicle in current lane, not just relative to the speed and desired speed of subject vehicle. Drivers may accelerate or decelerate during lane-changing due to different traffic conditions.

ATC sector capacity as a measure of air traffic safety	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: BEYOND THE HORIZON			English	Proceedings Paper	22nd Annual Conference on European Safety and Reliability (ESREL)	SEP 29-OCT 02, 2013	Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS	Netherlands Org Appl Sci Res, Delft Univ Technol, Dutch Soc Risk Management & Reliabil Anal, European Safety & Reliabil Assoc			AIRCRAFT	Air traffic management belongs to the class of complex, hierarchical socio-technical systems. The hierarchy can be divided into four levels: current real-time air traffic control, traffic management in the daily cycle, realization of transportation tasks in half-year period, long-term development of the air traffic system. Ensuring the safety of flight operations is one of the main objectives of air traffic control (ATC) services. An important problem is to quantify the level of safety, both current and future-arising from current and planned control decisions. This paper presents a method for quantitative safety evaluation for the second level of the hierarchy-the process of managing traffic in a daily cycle. The concept of control sector capacity is commonly used this context-both in terms of area control (ACC) sectors and airport terminal areas (TMA). It is used as a basic tool in management of air traffic flows (ATFM). This paper proposes the use of the concept of ATC sector capacity, along with the actual volume of traffic as a measure of air traffic safety. In this paper the definition of air traffic sector capacity is presented. Mathematical models to determine the capacity are proposed, an example model for airport area is presented. Safety indicators based on analysis of the traffic volume and ATC sector capacity are also defined. A method and computer tool for quantitative evaluation of medium-term air traffic safety was elaborated. Brief presentation of results of simulation experiments based on the real air traffic in FIR Warsaw indicating the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed method is shown.

K.; Currie, Graham; Sarvi, Majid; Logan, David			Experimental Microsimulation Modeling of Road Safety Impacts of Bus Priority	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; PERFORMANCE; CALIBRATION	The safety implications of the implementation of bus lanes on road corridors remain unclear, given the mixed findings from previous research. Recent research found improvements in road safety resulting from bus priority in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia; however, the causal factors for this effect remain to be explored. In this study, an experimental microscopic traffic simulation modeling approach was adopted to explore the road safety effects of implementation of bus lanes on a representative road corridor in Melbourne. Models compared the traffic conflict patterns of three traffic configurations: mixed traffic (base case, no priority), curbside lane reallocated for buses, and new curbside lane added for buses. For each configuration, the safety performance of the road corridor, including intersection approaches and bus stop locations, was measured with two safety performance indicators: deceleration rate to avoid a crash and crash potential index. The overall results showed that curbside bus lanes reduced conflict occurrences at intersection approaches and bus stop locations, regardless of the scheme design. The results pointed to reductions in rear-end and sideswipe accidents as being a major driver of the reduced risk of a road accident, consistent with the outcomes found in previous research. Bus priority acts to remove bus movements from traffic flows and provides new and separate road space for curbside turning traffic at intersections. These effects of bus priority act to reduce sideswipe and rear-end traffic conflicts and thus to improve road safety. Implications for policy and future research are suggested.	[Goh, Kelvin C.

To mine useful data, prior knowledge has been used to train the artificial neural network (ANN) to identify the traffic conditions in the traffic information forecasting. Subjective information has hence been introduced into the ANN model. To solve this problem, a new ANN model is proposed based on the data mining technology in this work. The Self-Organized Feature Map (SOFM) is firstly employed to cluster the traffic data through an unsupervised learning and provide the labels for these data. Then labeled data were used to train the GA-Chaos optimized RBF neural network. Herein, the GA-Chaos algorithm is used to train the RBF parameters. Experimental tests use practical data sets from the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to validate the performance of the proposed ANN model. The results show that the proposed method can extract the potential patterns hidden in the traffic data and can accurately predict the future traffic state. The prediction accuracy is beyond 95%.

J	Fang, J				Fang, Jie			Performance Tuning of Coordinated Active Traffic Control Algorithm: Simultaneously Improving Corridor Safety and Mobility Performances	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							VARIABLE-SPEED LIMITS; FREEWAY; IMPACTS	Proactive traffic control based on macroscopic traffic flow model is an innovative approach to active traffic management. An online, model predictive control (MPC) based active traffic control algorithm, DynaTAM, is proposed to implement integrated control through ramp metering (RM) and variable speed limit (VSL). DynaTAM predicts traffic states to anticipate incoming traffic congestion and to provide control plan recommendations for optimizing the network traffic conditions. However, as with other sophisticated prediction-based control algorithms, a system fine-tuning procedure is required for DynaTAM. In this study, two aspects will be addressed to further improve system performance. First, the control algorithm is evaluated to find the correlations between the prediction horizon length and the controlled system performance to suggest the most efficient prediction horizon length for the control algorithm. Second, safety considerations are quantitatively incorporated into the control algorithm. The control algorithm optimizes the traffic network targeting the cost reductions achieved by both improved mobility and reduced crash risk. A field-data-based simulation study is conducted to evaluate the system performance within various parameters and to determine the most suitable algorithm parameters. Optimized by the refined DynaTAM algorithm, the targeted area shows significant improvements in terms of both traffic safety and mobility.

Based on CART method, this paper establishes the relationship between freeway incident frequency and roadway characteristics, traffic variables and environmental factors. The results of CART method indicate that the impact of influencing factors (weather, weekday/weekend, traffic flow and roadway characteristics) of incident frequency is not consistent for different incident types during different time periods. By comparing with Negative Binomial Regression model, CART method is demonstrated to be a good alternative method for analyzing incident frequency. Then the discussion about the relationship between incident frequency and influencing factors is provided, and the future research orientation is pointed out.

However, their effects have not been taken into account in HCM 2000 model.Recently two studies have been carried out to address this issue: 1) Dahl and Lee (2012) proposed an expectation theory based approachto incorporate the effect of HGVs [1]; and2)Qu et al. (2013) deriveda new roundabout capacity model by assuming that each exiting vehicle could provide one entry opportunity for waiting vehicles [2]. In this paper, the two models are integrated using a scenario-based approachtoanalyse the effects of not only exiting vehicles but also HGVs. A comparative study indicates that HCM 2000 model performs well under low to mid traffic conditions while it underestimates the capacities under high traffic conditions in combination with high proportions of exiting vehicles.

According to the concept of two-fluid theory, vehicles in the traffic stream were divided into two classes: stopped (for traffic signal) and moving. The amount of stopped and moving vehicles was estimated by applying fixed number theory and traffic flow theory. Then the model described flow-density relationship was derived on the basis of the concept of space-mean density. After that, impacts of the parameters in the model on the flow-density relationship are analyzed. Finally, twelve simulated conditions were designed and five critical flow was chosen to test the estimated accuracy of the model. Results show that the maximum and average absolute value of relative deviations between exact density and the estimated one was 10.07% and 6.39% respectively.

But little research up to date has discussed in detail how these factors impact the TTC characteristics. In this paper, field Beijing expressway data were collected by video with different locations, lanes, traffic conditions and following vehicle types. Accordingly, some basic descriptive statistics of total TTC samples were shown and analyzed. We then used T-test to analyze the effect of road environments, traffic conditions, and vehicle types on TTC statistically. The results implied three main findings. Firstly, TTC was found to change according to road environments (i.e. TTC on weaving segment is smaller than other locations), secondly, some evidence supported this hypothesis that traffic conditions (especially uncongested traffic condition) affect TTC significantly, and lastly, little correlation was found between TTC means and vehicle types.

Taking Huangpu road as the investigation object, the traffic flow velocity parameters before and after direction changing were investigated respectively. By the method of mathematical statistics, the individual vehicles' velocities and the traffic flow velocity before and after direction changing were compared and analyzed. Using the method of regression analysis, the relationship model between velocity and density of reversible lane was constructed. This paper also discussed the problems of this kind of lane. The research showed that, in terms of traffic flow operation velocity of temporary reversible lane, there is obvious and regular difference between before and after direction changing. There is a certain relationship between the velocity and density. The problem of lower lane utilization ratio of temporary reversible lane usually exists.

However, the actual traffic load models significantly differ from the characteristic load models used in the design. The analysis of former design codes of bridges used in the last century in Latvia showed the considerable increase in values of characteristic traffic loads. The traffic loads proposed in Eurocode 1: Actions on Structures - Part 2: Traffic Loads on Bridges considerably increase the actual traffic loads passing Latvian bridges. Therefore, the use of the actual traffic load models for assessment of the load carrying capacity of the older bridges will extend the service life and save financial funds for the maintenance of the bridges. Earlier, the obtaining of the correct traffic data was complicated. Today after implementation of the Weight-in-Motion system, it is possible to collect vehicle information without interrupting traffic flow. This includes data of the number of axles, vehicle wheelbase, speed and axle loads that describes the actual loading cases on the roads and bridges. The analysis of the recorded data of Weight-in-Motion the system enabled to obtain the load distribution diagrams, to determine the position of the heaviest axel, traffic speed and intensity values. The obtained results of statistical analysis of actual traffic loads allowed developing the integrated traffic load models for bridges, based on actual traffic load in Latvia. Obtained integrated traffic load models for bridges in Latvia is used for evaluation of the value of the adjustment factor a of the load model LM1 proposed in Eurocode 1: Actions on Structures - Part 2: Traffic Loads on Bridges.

Incident-induced delay (IID) refers to the extra travel delay resulting from incidents on top of the recurrent congestion. Quantifying IID would help people better understand the real cost of incidents, maximize the benefit-cost ratio of investment on incident remedy actions, and develop active traffic management and integrated corridor management strategies. By combining a modified queuing diagram and short-term traffic flow forecasting techniques, this study proposes an approach to estimate the temporal IID for a roadway section, given that the incidents occurs between two traffic flow detectors. The approach separates IID from the total travel delay, estimates IID for each individual incident, and only takes volume as input for IID quantification, avoiding using speed data that are widely involved in previous algorithms yet are less available or prone to poor data quality. Therefore, this approach can be easily deployed to broader ranges where only volume data are available. To verify its estimation accuracy, this study captures two incident videos and extracts ground-truth IID data, which is rarely done by previous studies. The verification shows that the IID estimation errors of the proposed approach are within 6% for both cases. The approach has been implemented in a Web-based system, which enables quick, convenient, and reliable freeway IID estimation in the Puget Sound region in the state of Washington.

A new method of detecting traffic accidents is proposed based on temporal data mining, which can identify the unknown and unrecorded accidents by traffic police. Time series model was constructed using ternary numbers to reflect the state of traffic flow based on cell transmission model. In order to deal with the aftereffects of linear drift between time series and to reduce the computational cost, discrete Fourier transform was implemented to turn time series from time domain to frequency domain. The pattern of the time series when an accident happened could be recognized using the historical crash data. Then taking Euclidean distance as the similarity evaluation function, similarity data mining of the transformed time series was carried out. If the result was less than the given threshold, the two time series were similar and an accident happened probably. A numerical example was carried out and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This document presents a survey of the research works related to image processing, traffic load, and the technologies used to re-solve this issue. Results of the implementation of two approaches: morphology-based segmentation and edge detection using sobel operator, which are close to traffic load computation have been shown. Segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into its constituent parts or objects or regions. These regions share common characteristics based on color, intensity, texture, etc. The first step in image analysis is to segment an image based on discontinuity detection technique (Edge-based) or similarity detection technique (Region-based). Morphological operators are tools that affect the shape and boundaries of regions in the image. Starting with dilation and erosion, the typical morphological operation involves an image and a structure element. The edge detection consists of creating a binary image from a grayscale image where the pixels in the binary image are turned off or on depending on whether they belong to region boundaries or not. Image processing is considered as an attractive and flexible technique for automatic analysis of road traffic scenes for the measurement and data collection of road traffic parameters. Combined background differencing and edge detection and segmentation techniques are used to detect vehicles and measure various traffic parameters. Real-time measurement and analysis of road traffic flow parameters such as volume, speed and queue are increasingly required for traffic control and management.	[Gupta, Pratishtha; Purohit, G.

The model designs driver behavior changes because of the effect of turn light of front vehicle,and introduces rules of changing lanes, cutting lanes and yielding the right of way for the rear vehicle. Through computer numerical simulations, this study has presented curve diagrams of relationship between turning rate and energy consumption and also analyzed the effects of driver behavior of the rear vehicles on traffic flow. The results indicate that increased probability of lane change make more turning rate and energy consumption. When probability of lane change is from 0.5 to 1.0, turning rate increases 13.23% and energy consumption increases 22.15%. Compared with the traditional model, STCA model can depict more complex traffic situations and reproduce driver behaviors and more realistic process of traffic.

For this purpose, a road network was established for Jiangsu province, and the topological parameters of this network and the tourism degree of coordination among each prefectural city were calculated as well. The results demonstrate that the inclusion of the spatial structure of the traffic network was not necessary for determining the supply-demand balance for tourism; thus, the collection of traffic flow data is required to perform further research. As a side result, it has been determined that the circuit routes are relatively absent from the Jiangsu traffic network, which might hinder tourism, and tourism resources are undersupplied to most prefectural cities in Jiangsu.

Experiment results show that the lane changing rules do have an important impact on the traffic flow of on-ramp system. The rule without safe-distance could make the capacity of the on-ramp section get its biggest value, while the capacity of upstream and downstream of main road both gets brought down; the rule considering forward and backward safe-distance could make the upstream section, downstream section and the whole system get their biggest value.

J	Chen, B; Zhong, Z; Xie, X; Lu, PZ				Chen, Bin; Zhong, Zheng; Xie, Xu; Lu, Pengzhen			Measurement-Based Vehicle Load Model for Urban Expressway Bridges	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							GPS	Significant changes in vehicle loads have occurred in China due to the development of the automobile industry and transportation within the past two decades, particularly the rapid increase in traffic flow and the large-scale emergence of heavy trucks. However, research into vehicle loadings on urban bridges is not well developed. In this study, based on traffic flow data collected using a weigh-in-motion system installed on an expressway in an urban logistics zone, we analyzed the traffic flow, vehicle types, and gross vehicle weight (GVW) features and developed models for the vehicle load and fatigue load. According to the axle space, axle types, and axle number, the trucks in the traffic flow were classified into 10 representative vehicle types. The probability distribution of the GVW was fitted to a three-class mixed log-normal distribution. Using the improved Gumbel method, we determined the extreme value distribution of the vehicle loadings in the purpose reference period and assessed the vehicle loadings of urban bridges. In addition, using the equivalent damage theory, six equivalent vehicle models were established according to the measurements of the axle weight and axle space, thereby obtaining a simplified model of fatigue vehicle loadings on urban expressway bridges.

Mech., 91, 763-776, 20111, a macroscopic approach, derived from fluid-dynamics models, has been introduced to infer traffic conditions prone to road traffic collisions along highways' sections. In these studies, the governing equations are coupled within an Eulerian framework, which assumes fixed interfaces between the models. A coupling in Lagrangian coordinates would enable us to get rid of this (not very realistic) assumption. In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness and the suitability of the coupling of the governing equations within the Lagrangian framework. Further, we illustrate some features of the proposed approach through some numerical simulations.

Therefore, the railway train flow has shown the strong nonlinear characteristics, which makes it quite difficult to take further relative studies. Fortunately, the cellular automaton model has its own advantages in solving nonlinear problems and traffic flow simulation. Considering the mixed features of multispeed running trains on the passenger dedicated lines, this paper presents a new train model under the moving block system with different types of trains running with the cellular automaton idea. By analyzing such key factors as the maintenance skylight, the proportion of the multispeed running trains, and the distance between adjacent stations and departure intervals, the corresponding running rules for the cellular automaton model are reestablished herewith. By means of this CA model, the program of train running system is designed to analyze the potential impact on railway carrying capacity by various factors; the model can also be implemented to simulate the actual train running process and to draw the train operation diagram by computers. Basically the theory can be applied to organize the train operation on the dedicated passenger lines.

Passenger Car Units at Different Levels of Service for Capacity Analysis of Multilane Interurban Highways in India	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Traffic management; Simulation; Highways and roads; Vehicles; India; Vehicles; Mixed traffic; Simulation; Passenger car unit; Interurban highway; Capacity	VEHICLES	Passenger car units (PCU) of different types of vehicles are required to convert a mixed traffic stream into a homogeneous equivalent, and thereby to express the mixed traffic flow in terms of equivalent number of passenger cars. Earlier studies have reported that PCU for a vehicle is dynamic in nature and changes with traffic volume and proportional share of a vehicle type in the traffic stream. The present study provides PCU values for different types of vehicles typically found on interurban multilane highways in India at different levels of service (LOS). Traffic simulation model VISSIM is used to generate the traffic flow and speed data for conditions that are difficult to obtain from field observations. Important VISSIM parameters are first calibrated to reflect mixed traffic flow behavior and then the software is used to draw the speed-volume relationships for cars and one of the remaining four categories of vehicles in the traffic stream. The proportion of second category of the vehicle was also varied to observe its effects on PCU values. Finally, PCU values are suggested for different type of vehicles at different LOS and for different traffic composition on four-lane and six-lane divided highways.

The primary contribution of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of DMSs in a rural area during a full freeway closure by using field data, driver surveys, and simulation. A full freeway closure scenario offers an opportunity to identify the effects of DMSs, because there is a network-wide shift in traffic demand from the closed route to the alternate route(s). A unique data collection and analysis approach was used to capture regional traffic patterns, including the processing of all traffic movements from four full interchanges. A significant increase in traffic flow on the detour route and a corresponding decrease on the affected route were observed during the freeway closure. Simulation was used to isolate the benefits of DMSs from other traveler information modes such as newspaper, TV, and radio, and to explore the sensitivity of the network to different levels of driver compliance. Depending on the proportion of drivers who chose to divert based on DMSs, monetary benefits were estimated to range between US$2,394 and $65,643 for the three-day freeway closure. Driver surveys conducted during the freeway closure revealed that 57% of the drivers utilized DMS information and 41% of drivers relied solely on DMSs to obtain information related to the closure and the detour route.

J	Marsetic, R; Semrov, D; Zura, M				Marsetic, Rok; Semrov, Darja; Zura, Marijan			ROAD ARTERY TRAFFIC LIGHT OPTIMIZATION WITH USE OF REINFORCEMENT LEARNING	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						reinforcement learning; Q learning; road artery; traffic control; traffic lights		The basic principle of optimal traffic control is the appropriate real-time response to dynamic traffic flow changes. Signal plan efficiency depends on a large number of input parameters. An actuated signal system can adjust very well to traffic conditions, but cannot fully adjust to stochastic traffic volume oscillation. Due to the complexity of the problem analytical methods are not applicable for use in real time, therefore the purpose of this paper is to introduce heuristic method suitable for traffic light optimization in real time. With the evolution of artificial intelligence new possibilities for solving complex problems have been introduced. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that the use of the Q learning algorithm for traffic lights optimization is suitable. The Q learning algorithm was verified on a road artery with three intersections. For estimation of the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm comparison with an actuated signal plan was carried out. The results (average delay per vehicle and the number of vehicles that left road network) show that Q learning algorithm outperforms the actuated signal controllers. The proposed algorithm converges to the minimal delay per vehicle regardless of the stochastic nature of traffic. In this research the impact of the model parameters (learning rate, exploration rate, influence of communication between agents and reward type) on algorithm effectiveness were analysed as well.

We present our work aimed at the application of video based real-time traffic jam detection. Our method can handle both calibrated and un-calibrated scenarios, operating in world and in image coordinate systems respectively. The method is designed to be operated on a smart camera, but is also suitable for a standard personal computer. The combination of state-of-the-art algorithms for vehicle detections and velocity estimation allows robust long-term system operation in due to the high recall rate and very low false alarm rate. The proposed method not only detects traffic jam events in real-time, but also precisely localizes traffic jams by their start and end positions per road lane. We describe also our strategy in making computationally heavy algorithms real-time capable even on hardware with a limited computing power.

The roundabout is modeled as a sequence of 2x2 junctions: with one mainline and secondary incoming and outgoing roads. We consider two cost functionals: the total travel time and the total waiting time, which give an estimate of the time spent by drivers on the network section. These cost functionals are minimized analytically for each junction with respect to the right of way parameter of the incoming road. Then, through numerical simulations, the traffic behavior is studied for the whole roundabout. The numerical approximations compare the traffic behavior for an optimized right of way parameter and for a fixed constant parameter. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The complex indicator has been elaborated using a multicriteria algorithm, based on concordance analysis. We calibrate a synthetic performance indicator for an urban road network, containing all those elements required for characterizing urban network functionality. Specifically, a series of core indicators is identified, integrated and interlinked. The functionality of an urban road network can he determined by analyzing several aspects that commonly affect operating conditions such as traffic flow, safety, road maintenance conditions, accessibility and environmental impact. No methodology is currently available in the scientific literature for measuring urban road network performance, using indicators that combine information about various aspects: the indicators used in the analysis of transport systems assess performance separately from different perspectives. For example, the quality of traffic flow is measured through the Level of Service (HCM, 2010), accessibility performance is assessed through clustering measures (Jiang & Claramunt, 2004) and safety conditions are measured in terms of number of road accidents (Tingvall, Stigson, Eriksson, Johansson, Krafft & Lie, 2010). This paper proposes a unique modeling tool that incorporates the different indicators used separately to calculate network performance for each area. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Generally two queues form in the study area. First one is in front of the booths and the second one is after the booths, due to the existing bottleneck between the booths and the Bridge. Queue/delay performance of the system is analyzed incorporating the queuing theory. According to demand and service time of each server, queue may occur before the booths and/or before the bottleneck. The propagation of the second queue may overlap the first one because of the bottleneck capacity and for sure the increasing demand. Four different scenarios are simulated in order to evaluate capacity of the toll collectors and the bottleneck section. Some traffic management strategies are applied to improve the quality of service by decreasing delays and increasing capacities. In each scenario, average delay time per vehicle, average travel time, occupancy and speed data are obtained with microsimulation software, Vissim. Finally, optimum number of toll collectors is determined by seeking to minimize delays and maximize bottleneck capacity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The performance of an urban road system can be defined according to different thematic areas such as traffic flow, accessibility, maintenance and safety, for which the scientific literature proposes different measurement indicators. However variations in performance are influenced by interventions which differ from one another, such as infrastructure, management, regulation or legislation, etc.. Therefore sometimes it is not easy to understand which areas to act on and what type of action to pursue to improve road network performance. Of particular interest are the tools based on the use of synthetic macro-indicators that are representative of the individual thematic areas and are able to describe the behavior of the entire network as a function of its characteristic elements. These instruments are of major significance when they assess performance not so much in absolute terms but in relative terms, i.e. in relation to other urban areas comparable to the one being examined. Therefore the objective of the proposed paper is to compare performances of different urban networks, using a non-parametric linear programming technique such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), Farrel (1957), in order to provide technical support to the policy maker in the choice of actions to be implemented to make urban road systems efficient. This work is the conclusive study of road system performance analysis using DEA. The study forms part of a research project supported by grant.

Among this type of data, vehicle trajectories are an important source of information for traffic flow theory, driving behaviour modelling, innovation in traffic management and safety and environmental studies. Recent developments in sensing technologies and image processing algorithms reduced the resources (time and costs) required for detailed traffic data collection, promoting the feasibility of site-based and vehicle-based naturalistic driving observation. For testing the core models of a traffic microsimulation application for safety assessment, vehicle trajectories were collected by remote sensing on a typical Portuguese suburban motorway. Multiple short flights over a stretch of an urban motorway allowed for the collection of several partial vehicle trajectories. In this paper the technical details of each step of the methodology used is presented: image collection, image processing, vehicle identification and vehicle tracking. To collect the images, a high-resolution camera was mounted on an aircraft's gyroscopic platform. The camera was connected to a DGPS for extraction of the camera position and allowed the collection of high resolution images at a low frame rate of 2s. After generic image orthorrectification using the flight details and the terrain model, computer vision techniques were used for line rectification: the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm was used for detection and description of image features, and the random sample consensus algorithm for feature matching. Vehicle detection was carried out by median-based background subtraction. After the computation of the detected foreground and the shadow detection using a spectral ratio technique, region segmentation was used to identify candidates for vehicle positions. Finally, vehicles were tracked using a k-shortest disjoints paths algorithm. This approach allows for the optimization of an entire set of trajectories against all possible position candidates using motion-based optimization. Besides the importance of a new trajectory dataset that allows the development of new behavioural models and the validation of existing ones, this paper also describes the application of state-of-the-art algorithms and methods that significantly minimize the resources needed for such data collection.

Most existing Bayesian methods adopt prior OD matrixes, which are always troublesome to be obtained. Since transportation systems normally have stored large amounts of historical link flows, a Bayesian network model using these prior link flows is proposed. Based on some observed link flows, the estimation results are updated. Under normal distribution assumption, the proposed Bayesian network model considers the level of total traffic flow, the variability of link flows, and the violation of the traffic flow conservation law. Both the point estimation and the corresponding probability intervals can be provided by this model. To solve the Bayesian network model, a specific procedure which can avoid matrix inversion is proposed. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the proposed Bayesian network method. The results show that the proposed method has a high accuracy and practical applicability.

An Improved Car-Following Model in Vehicle Networking Based on Network Control	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							H-INFINITY CONTROL; SYSTEMS	Vehicle networking is a system to realize information interoperability between vehicles and people, vehicles and roads, vehicles and vehicles, and cars and transport facilities, through the network information exchange, in order to achieve the effective monitoring of the vehicle and traffic flow. Realizing information interoperability between vehicles and vehicles, which can affect the traffic flow, is an important application of network control system (NCS). In this paper, a car-following model using vehicle networking theory is established, based on network control principle. The car-following model, which is an improvement of the traditional traffic model, describes the traffic in vehicle networking condition. The impact that vehicle networking has on the traffic flow is quantitatively assessed in a particular scene of one-way, no lane changing highway. The examples show that the capacity of the road is effectively enhanced by using vehicle networking.	[Kong, D. Y.] Tongji Univ, Sch Automot Studies, Shanghai 201804, Peoples R China; [Xu, H.

In the situation when the available financial resources for street and bridge construction are limited, the most important issue is to evaluate all possible ways to reduce the total road construction costs what is first of all achieved by reducing geometrical parameters of arterials. These parameters are reduced by changing the design speed, while ensuring an adequate level of traffic safety. Therefore there is a need for a review of standards for the street functions and categories of streets in urban areas. An analysis of average momentary speed impact on urban street and road network design, as well as momentary speed impact on traffic conditions has been done. A relationship between design speed and momentary speed at different capacity ratio of traffic flow has been found.

In this paper, a robust missing traffic flow data imputation approach based on matrix completion is proposed. In the proposed method, the similarity of traffic flow from day to day is exploited to impute missing data by the low-rank hypothesis of constructed traffic flow matrix. And the physical limitation of road capacity and nonnegativity is also considered through the optimization process, which avoids the possibility of producing negative and overcapacity values. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can impute missing data and recover outlier in a unify framework. The experiment results show that the proposed method is more accurate, stable, and reasonable.

Previous studies about the travellers' route choice were mainly based on the expected utility maximization theory. However, with the gradually increasing knowledge about the uncertainty of the transportation system, the researchers have realized that there is much constraint in expected utility maximization theory, because expected utility maximization requires travellers to be 'absolutely rational'; but in fact, travellers are not truly 'absolutely rational'. The anticipated regret theory proposes an alternative framework to the traditional risk-taking in route choice behaviour which might be more scientific and reasonable. We have applied the anticipated regret theory to the analysis of the risk route choosing process, and constructed an anticipated regret utility function. By a simple case which includes two parallel routes, the route choosing results influenced by the risk aversion degree, regret degree and the environment risk degree have been analyzed. Moreover, the user equilibrium model based on the anticipated regret theory has been established. The equivalence and the uniqueness of the model are proved; an efficacious algorithm is also proposed to solve the model. Both the model and the algorithm are demonstrated in a real network. By an experiment, the model results and the real data have been compared. It was found that the model results can be similar to the real data if a proper regret degree parameter is selected. This illustrates that the model can better explain the risk route choosing behaviour. Moreover, it was also found that the traveller' regret degree increases when the environment becomes more and more risky.

An intermodal freight transport system for optimal supply chain logistics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Spatio-temporal data mining; Intermodal transport; Support vector machines; Mixed integer programming	SUPPORT VECTOR REGRESSION; URBAN TRAFFIC FLOW; PREDICTION; CONTAINERS; NETWORKS; MODELS; VOLUME; TRAINS	Complexity in transport networks evokes the need for instant response to the changing dynamics and uncertainties in the upstream operations, where multiple modes of transport are often available, but rarely used in conjunction. This paper proposes a model for strategic transport planning involving a network wide intermodal transport system. The system determines the spatio-temporal states of road based freight networks (unimodal) and future traffic flow in definite time intervals. This information is processed to devise efficient scheduling plans by coordinating and connecting existing rail transport schedules to road based freight systems (intermodal). The traffic flow estimation is performed by kernel based support vector mechanisms while mixed integer programming (MIP) is used to optimize schedules for intermodal transport network by considering various costs and additional capacity constraints. The model has been successfully applied to an existing Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) distribution network in India with encouraging results, (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we present a novel agent-based approach called accident-avoidance full velocity difference model (abbreviated as AA-FVDM) to simulate realistic street-level rural traffics, on top of the existing FVDM. The main distinction between FVDM and AA-FVDM is that FVDM cannot handle a critical real-world traffic problem while AA-FVDM settles this problem and retains the essence of FVDM. We also design a novel scheme to animate the lane-changing maneuvering process (in particular, the execution course). Through numerous simulations, we demonstrate that besides addressing a previously unaddressed real-world traffic problem, our AA-FVDM method efficiently (in real time) simulates large-scale traffic flows (tens of thousands of vehicles) with realistic, smooth effects.

J	Teh, E; Jamson, S; Carsten, O; Jamson, H				Teh, Evona; Jamson, Samantha; Carsten, Oliver; Jamson, Hamish			Temporal fluctuations in driving demand: The effect of traffic complexity on subjective measures of workload and driving performance	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article						Driver workload; Traffic density; Lane change; Subjective measurement	MENTAL WORKLOAD; SITUATION AWARENESS; TASK-DIFFICULTY; DRIVER BEHAVIOR; SIMULATOR	Traffic density has been shown to be a factor of traffic complexity which influences driver workload. However, little research has systematically varied and examined how traffic density affects workload in dynamic traffic conditions. In this driving simulator study, the effects of two dynamically changing traffic complexity factors (Traffic Flow and Lane Change Presence) on workload were examined. These fluctuations in driving demand were then captured using a continuous subjective rating method and driving performance measures. The results indicate a linear upward trend in driver workload with increasing traffic flow, up to moderate traffic flow levels. The analysis also showed that driver workload increased when a lane change occurred in the drivers' forward field of view, with further increases in workload when that lane change occurred in close proximity. Both of these main effects were captured via subjective assessment and with driving performance parameters such as speed variation, mean time headway and variation in lateral position. Understanding how these traffic behaviours dynamically influence driver workload is beneficial in estimating and managing driver workload. The present study suggests possible ways of defining the level of workload associated with surrounding traffic complexity, which could help contribute to the design of an adaptive workload estimator.

Road congestion degree is added to the reinforcement learning algorithm as a medium that passes the influence of one traveler's decision to others. Meanwhile, the agents used in the algorithm are initialized from typical activity patterns extracted from the travel survey diary data of Shangyu city in China. In the simulation, both macroscopic activity-travel characteristics such as traffic flow spatial-temporal distribution and microscopic characteristics such as activity-travel schedules of each agent are obtained. Comparing the simulation results with the survey data, we find that deviation of the peak-hour traffic flow is less than 5%, while the correlation of the simulated versus survey location choice distribution is over 0.9.

The simulation results show that, with the increase of the bend radius, the peak flow will be continuously increased, and the fundamental diagram will become more similar to that of the classic NaSch model; the smaller the bend radius is, the easier it is for the occurrence of blockage; for different bend lengths, all the corresponding traffic flows show that the phenomenon of go-and-stop and the bends exert slight inhibitory effect on traffic flow; under the same bend radius, the inhibition effect of the bends on the traffic flow will be weakened with the increase of the friction coefficiency.

This article presents the most important aspects of the noise mapping project across Santiago, a city of nearly six million inhabitants. The study was performed employing limited information and a low-cost, vehicular traffic noise predictive model. The methodology applied to the Chilean experience can also be used to create noise maps for major cities. An evaluation of noise prediction models, considering simplifications of the modeling environment (buildings) and for the vehicular traffic flow rates attributed to the streets under study, was made. The noise levels were modeled according to recommended exposure values for the above area. The results revealed that the noise levels for the city of Santiago were high in a relevant percentage of the surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Suarez, E.; Barros, J.

J	Krishnamurthy, K; Arasan, VT				Krishnamurthy, Karuppanagounder; Arasan, Venkatachalam Thamizh			Effect of road width and traffic volume on vehicular interactions in heterogeneous traffic	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						flow; headway; traffic safety capacity; transport planning; transportation analysis	SIMULATION; FLOW	Highway traffic flow phenomena involve several complex and stochastic variables with high interdependencies. The variations in roadway, traffic and environmental factors influence the traffic flow quality significantly. Capacity analysis of road sections under different traffic and geometric conditions need to quantify the vehicles of widely varying characteristics to a common and universally acceptable unit. Passenger car unit (PCU) is the universally adopted unit of traffic volume, keeping the passenger car as the standard vehicle' with reference to its static and dynamic characteristics; other vehicles are expressed to its equivalent number in terms of PCUs. The studies carried out in this aspect represent the dynamic nature of impedance caused by a vehicle while moving through a traffic stream. The PCU values recommended by the Highway Capacity Manual are widely applied in many countries; however, their applicability is highly under debate because of the variations in prevailing local traffic conditions. There are several factors that influence the PCU values such as traffic, roadway, vehicle, environmental and control conditions, etc. Apart from vehicular characteristics, the other two major factors that influence the PCU of vehicles are the following: (i) road width and (ii) traffic volume. In this study, estimation of PCU values for the different types of vehicles of a highly heterogeneous traffic on 7.5- and 11.0-m-wide roads, using micro-simulation technique, has been dealt with. It has been found that the PCU value of a vehicle type varies significantly with variation in road width and traffic volume. The results of the study indicate that the PCU values are significantly influenced by the said two factors. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Maximizing traffic flow and minimizing the average waiting time are the goals of intelligent traffic control. Each junction wants to get larger traffic flow. During the course, junctions form a policy of coordination as well as constraints for adjacent junctions to maximize their own interests. A good traffic signal timing policy is helpful to solve the problem. However, as there are so many factors that can affect the traffic control model, it is difficult to find the optimal solution. The disability of traffic light controllers to learn from past experiences caused them to be unable to adaptively fit dynamic changes of traffic flow. Considering dynamic characteristics of the actual traffic environment, reinforcement learning algorithm based traffic control approach can be applied to get optimal scheduling policy. The proposed Sarsa(lambda)-based real-time traffic control optimization model can maintain the traffic signal timing policy more effectively. The Sarsa(lambda)-based model gains traffic cost of the vehicle, which considers delay time, the number of waiting vehicles, and the integrated saturation from its experiences to learn and determine the optimal actions. The experiment results show an inspiring improvement in traffic control, indicating the proposed model is capable of facilitating real-time dynamic traffic control.

J	Fanti, MP; Iacobellis, G; Mangini, AM; Ukovich, W				Fanti, Maria Pia; Iacobellis, Giorgio; Mangini, Agostino Marcello; Ukovich, Walter			Freeway Traffic Modeling and Control in a First-Order Hybrid Petri Net Framework	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						First-order hybrid Petri nets (FOHPN); freeway traffic model; traffic control; variable speed limits	REAL-TIME CONTROL; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; OPTIMAL COORDINATION; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; SOUTHERN PART; FLOW; OPTIMIZATION	The paper presents a model for freeway traffic performance evaluation and control in a First-Order Hybrid Petri Net (FOHPN) framework. Such a hybrid Petri net formalism includes continuous places holding fluid, discrete places containing a non-negative integer number of tokens and transitions, which are either discrete or continuous. In order to suitably describe the dynamics of the freeway traffic flow, we allow updating the transition firing speed as a function of the markings modeling the freeway traffic, as described by the stationary flow-density relationship. Moreover, we propose an online optimal control coordination of speed limits with the objective of maximizing the flow density. The use of FOHPNs offers several significant advantages with respect to the model existing in the related literature: the graphical feature enables an easy modular modeling approach and the mathematical aspects efficiently allow simulating and optimizing the system. The effectiveness of the FOHPN formalism is shown by applying the proposed modeling and control technique to a stretch of a freeway in the North-East of Italy, where a solution of an accident situation is considered. Note to Practitioners-The motivation of the present work is twofold. First, we propose a novel freeway system model in a FOHPN framework, in order to combine both the time-driven dynamics, considering the standard traffic fundamental diagram, and the event-driven dynamics, by modeling accidents, and recovery procedures. Second, we suggest an online optimal control coordination of speed limits with the objective of maximizing the flow density. The obtained model and control strategies can be used on line, when the traffic is congested, to predict the future state and to manage the system by variable speed limits control. Hence, based on the knowledge of the system state and the information about the occurrence of unpredictable events, the model can enable the decision makers to evaluate decisions such as the application of suitable recovery strategies after an accident or the choice of optimal speed limits in congested situations. Future research aims to investigate larger simulation campaigns describing more complex real systems in order to refine the model and the control schemes.

Using linear stability theory, stability condition of the presented model is obtained. Jamming transitions among the freely moving phase, the coexisting phase, and the uniform congested phase are investigated by employing nonlinear analysis. The modified KdV (mKdV) equation near the critical point is derived and the kink-antikink soliton solutions are obtained. Numerical simulations are presented to verify analytical results, showing that DDE can improve the stability of traffic flow effectively.

Emissions impact of road traffic incidents using Advanced Traveller Information Systems in a regional scale	17TH MEETING OF THE EURO WORKING GROUP ON TRANSPORTATION, EWGT2014	Transportation Research Procedia		English	Proceedings Paper	17th Meeting of the EURO-Working-Group on Transportation (EWGT)	JUL 02-04, 2014	Seville, SPAIN	EURO Working Grp, Univ Seville, Transportat Engn Div, Assoc European Operat Res Soc		Advanced Traveller Information Systems; mesoscopic model; incidents; emissions	ROUTE CHOICE; CONSUMPTION; CONGESTION; MODEL	Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) have been used worldwide to mitigate different road traffic impacts such as traffic congestion. However, the impact of these systems in fuel use and emissions is still an important research topic, due to their non-linear behaviour. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the impact of traffic incidents on a regional scale on energy and emissions levels. To achieve these objectives, several scenarios assessing different degrees of information (through the use of ATIS) were analysed. To model both traffic operations and emissions a mesoscopic traffic model (DTALite) and a road emissions methodology (EMEP/EEA) were used. The data related to the characterization of the road network was collected between Oporto and Aveiro, in Portugal. To ensure reliable results, the traffic model was calibrated and validated taking into account statistical methods that compare observed traffic flows and travel times with the values estimated by the model. The simulation platform was then used to assess the impact of traffic incident when it occurs in two different road types (a motorway and a highway), in order to evaluate the impact of usage and availability of information on emissions and fuel consumption. The results show that in a regional road network for each occurred incident, the use of ATIS can allow a maximum reduction of emissions and energy consumption on those routes where they occurred to up 2%. Nonetheless, a global analysis of the network indicates different results depending if the incident occur in a motorway or in a highway. In both cases, drivers tend to choose a route with similar costs to the previously selected. Furthermore, a non-linear trend between the availability of information and the impact on emissions and energy consumption was found. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Several models, algorithms and tools have been developed and implemented to support the management and design of urban networks. Nevertheless, researchers are still working in this field proposing new methods to improve mobility on urban networks in saturated (ordinary and emergency) traffic conditions. According to the recent literature, the global traffic conditions of an urban road network in ordinary conditions may be measured with good approximation by an asymmetric inverse-U shaped diagram called Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD). More specifically, the NFD puts in relation the number of vehicles present in the network with the (link-length weighted) total network traffic flow, in accordance with the fundamental diagram used for motorway links. As a case study, the methodology is applied to the urban network of Melito Porto Salvo (Italy), where a forthcoming disaster is simulated during the morning rush hour of a working day in accordance with the emergency plan drawn up by the Civil Protection Department. The evacuation phases of population from the area with motorized modes, are simulated by means of a dynamic assignment model, previously calibrated and validated. The NFD is compared with the objective function of an optimized network design approach. The objective of the paper is to verify if a global indicator, as it is the Network Fundamental Diagram, could be able to reflect the evolution of traffic conditions and to estimate the effects of control decisions of urban road networks (e.g. by means of traffic signals) during an evacuation phase, as the one described in the application.

Reliability becomes an important performance measure for transportation facilities. A variety of performance measures have been proposed to quantify it. Many of these indicators are based on percentiles of travel time. The knowledge of the distribution of travel time is needed to properly estimate these values. Congestion distorts the distribution and particular statistical distributions are needed. Different distributions have been proposed in the literature. In a previous paper, we presented a comparison of six statistical distributions used to model travel time. These six distributions are the Lognormal, Gamma, Burr (extended by Singh-Maddala), Weibull, a mixture of two Normal distributions and a mixture of two Gamma distributions. In this paper a probabilistic modeling of travel time which takes into account the levels-of-service is given. Levels of service are identified, then travel time distributions are modeled by level of service. This results in a very good fit between the empirical and modeled distributions Moreover, the adjustment was improved, thanks to the calibration of " Bureau of Public Roads" functions, linking the travel time to the traffic flow by level of service. The superiority of the Singh-Maddala distribution appears in many cases. This has been validated, thanks to travel time data from the same site at another period. However the parameters of the distributions vary from one year to another, due to changes in infrastructure. The transferability of the approach, not performed, will be based on travel time data on another site. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In response to rising energy costs and increased environmental concerns, eco-friendly route choices can be provided individually by means of smart navigation tools that allow several vehicle routing options designed to minimize air pollutant emissions and fuel consumption. Simultaneously, the use of intelligent road pricing systems and the use of variable message signs can change the route choice process of drivers (and thus network equilibrium), by varying the perceived attributes of competing routes. However, so far too little attention has been paid to the fact that the ecofriendliness of various routes may change, depending on vehicle characteristics which may cause problems on the efficiency of these systems. This issue has been empirically addressed in this research, using a database of more than 13,330 km of GPS data in six different Origin-Destination (OD) pairs and 9 different routes. Simultaneously, two different approaches for estimating (CO2, HC, CO, NOx) emissions were tested: a) second-by-second vehicle dynamics, using the Vehicle Specific Power (VSP) instantaneous model; and b) route average speed using the EMEP/PEA methodology. The results show that depending on the characteristics of the routes associated with a certain OD pair, the eco-friendly route may differ according to the vehicle model and the emissions estimation method. Innovative approaches to provide accurate emissions and eco-routing information are needed.	[Bandeira, J. M.; Fontes, T.; Pereira, S. R.; Fernandes, P.; Coelho, M.

At motorway merges, it is obvious that when the upstream and/or on-ramp flow is greater than the downstream (bottleneck) capacity, congestion arises. Therefore, queue will form and grow in relation with the demand and bottleneck capacity. The aim of this paper is to analyze the effect of mainstream and on-ramp flows on the congestion phenomena. As there is no ramp-metering application in Istanbul, on-ramp flow has an excessive effect on the congestion. In this study, macroscopic merge behavior is analyzed at one crucial motorway merge in Istanbul. Traffic data is obtained by Remote Traffic Microwave Sensors (RTMS) operated by the Municipality of Istanbul. RTMS data consists of volume, speed, occupancy and heavy vehicle counts per lane while minimum data collection interval is 2 minutes. Examined motorway merge section, main stream and on-ramp flows are observed by separate RTMS. Whole year weekday data of 2012 is used for analysis. It is seen that mainstream flow rate changes from 3360 pcph to 6210 pcph before congestion depends on the on-ramp flow rate that varies from 1755 pcph to 3060 pcph. In addition, on-ramp ratio is found between 0.23 and 0.43 which cause congestion on this motorway merge.

Knowledge of both headway and speed distributions plays a significant role in several fields of traffic flow analysis and simulation. In particular, we refer to operative analysis of road facilities in interrupted and uninterrupted flow conditions. This work identifies typical vehicle speed probability density functions (pdf s), for two-way two-lane road segments. The scarcity of empirical findings on these distributions in the literature (particularly for two-way two-lane roads) was one of the reasons for the study. The endogenous traffic parameters considered to affect speed distributions, flow rate and flow composition were taken into account. Mixture models for vehicle speeds were estimated. The data used for statistical analysis of headway and speeds came from traffic observations carried out on the rural road network of the province of Verona (north-east Italy). In the case in question, regardless of traffic conditions, the Skew-T single model turned out to be the one which best fitted the observed phenomena. The effect of flow rate in both directions (analysed and opposite) on vehicle speed distributions was also analysed. As expected, in all traffic conditions, the curves move to the left and become narrower as the flow rate increases. This effect seems to be less pronounced, where we measure the effect of the opposite flow rate.

The problem is formulated so as to find the signal plan design, the green and inter-green time for each signal group in response to recurrent traffic flow demand at an intersection. The approach used was the group-based Akcelik method for determining critical path, cycle length and green time split for each possible signal plan design. The signal plan design selection was formulated to minimize the total delay. The resulting algorithm was coded in Java and used TraSMAPI to dynamically link it to Aimsun's API, which allows an automatic change of the signal settings at an isolated signal control intersection. A theoretical three arms intersection with a time varying origin-destination demand example is tested to demonstrate the proposed method. The paper contributes to the development of an integrated design of signal plan design and signal timings. The proposed method aims to be sufficiently general for its application in different networks, with few inputs dependent on the local geometry layout. This strategy is able to react to non-schedulable events or unpredictable events without requiring human manipulation.

This kind of intersection is commonly used in the centres of Polish cities on multilane roads and fairly common in the case of tram lines running through a central island. The increase of traffic flow volumes on left turn and U-turn has made this type of roundabout difficult to operate. Small storage areas around central islands are critical places that significantly influence the capacity of this kind of intersection. The use of multiphase traffic signals causes major lengthening of crossing time for pedestrians which results in pedestrian delays at this kind of intersection. During the conducted analyses, microscopic models carried out in Transyt program, were used. They enabled the reconstruction of the traffic conditions and a few other important issues while assessing their capacity.

Based on the M/D/1 queuing model, this paper considers the sum of operating cost of a toll booth per unit time and waiting cost of a customer waiting for service per unit time as an objective function, and the optimal economic cost model in single direction of inbound or outbound and that in both directions for the highway toll station are respectively established. Then, the optimal allocation of operating toll booths for both directions of highway toll station is obtained. Finally, numerical examples are given to further illustrate the influences of the parameters related to the arrival rate of the traffic flow on the optimal allocation of operating toll booths at highway toll station.

This abundance of automotive infotainment devices can reduce significantly driver's decision making process and response times, leading to higher probability of collision, especially under adverse weather conditions. Typical dashboard instrumentation has proven inefficient to tackle such issues and Head-Up Display (HUD) interfaces deemed as an increasingly viable alternative by recent developments in automotive research and manufacturing. This paper presents our current work towards the development of a full-windshield HUD interface that could enhance human responses and provide time-dependant and only critical information for collisions avoidance.

In the proposed model, vehicle movement is categorized into cellular behavior as chasing, overtaking, changing lane, accelerating and decelerating, cellular status is categorized into velocity change and position change, and a set of cellular behavior constraints have been made based on the keep-right-except-to-pass rule and a revised rule allowing freely changing-lane. The main advantages of the proposed model include: the number of lanes is variable so the model is flexible for multi-lane road; a new road initialization method is adopted and capable of dealing with entering lanes in different probabilities. Matlab software package is used to simulate and calculate different indices including traffic flow, safety, and traffic density under different rules, safety conditions, traffic flow conditions and degree of road congestion. Finally, a number of experiments based on the established model were performed to explore the influence of model parameters (e.g., overtaking rules and speed limit) on of traffic indices and the results of the experiments are analyzed and discussed in detail.

The realistic lane changing may cut off the traffic flow into discontinuous flow, giving rise to congestion and vehicle delay. The aim of this paper is to study the car-following behaviors of drivers in real traffic scenes in which lane changing happens. The interrupted traffic flow system model is calibrated by minimizing the deviations between the observed dynamics and the simulated trajectory with a nonlinear optimization procedure-Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm. The reliability and robustness of the nonlinear fits are assessed for the deviation from one trajectory, acceleration and deceleration process respectively. The required errors are 0.0172 and 0.2845, which are sameness to representative one obtained in previous studies. Therefore, a used widely model that reflects the lane changing situation in reality is achieved.

Based on state feedback control strategy of ACC, the macroscopic model for automated traffic flow is established by integrating the dynamical law of traffic flow (conservation equation, flow distribution). Then the macroscopic traffic flow model for automated flow is verified by simulation experiments with periodic boundary. Finally, it is proved that the application of ACC system is beneficial to increase the throughput and improve the traffic flow efficiently by analyzing the fundamental diagram and comparing them to the manual-driven traffic flow.

Compared to traditional methods, the traffic information estimations from cellular network data are readily available, more cost-effective, and easier to deploy and maintain. In this paper, a vehicle speed estimation method is proposed to analyze the voice call signals (i.e., Call Arrival (CA) and Handover (HO)) from cellular networks. Some numerical models are proposed to estimate traffic flow according to HOs and estimate traffic density according to CAs. Then the estimated traffic flow and estimated traffic density are adopted to calculate the estimated vehicle speed. The experimental results show the accuracy of proposed vehicle speed estimation method is 89.75%.

Vehicle ad-hoc network (VANET), an application of the internet of things using in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), has already attracted broad attention in the world in recent years. It mainly provides communications between vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure, which significantly improve road transport efficiency, reduce energy consumption and ease traffic congestion. In this paper, we developed a client to make SUMO and NS3 work parallel by TraCI (Traffic Control Interface) in NS3. It helps NS3 get SUMO's information and sends instructions to change the states of vehicles and traffic lights. We present a realistic road traffic model with kinds of vehicles and intelligent traffic lights. The model is built in SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility). We use OpenStreetMap to generate a realistic map near the bund in Shanghai. The traffic flow is built according to a survey which makes us get meaningful and reliable statistics. A mechanism of changing the traffic lights dynamically is introduced to minimize traffic jams and give high priority to emergency vehicle. As a result, the waiting time and the duration of the vehicles in the scenario have reduced significantly after using the mechanism. The emergency vehicle's waiting time is less than others.

Information about the local traffic is an important factor considering the wider transportation system. The purpose of the method is to reduce control energy and fuel consumption, keep speed limits and travelling time while preceding and following vehicles are taken into consideration. Consequently, the energy-efficient cruise control strategy is able to adapt to the motion of the surrounding vehicles. Moreover, vehicle dynamics, road data and traffic flow in the surroundings are incorporated. The method leads to a multi-objective optimization problem. The design method is illustrated through a complex simulation example based on the CarSim software.

Therefore traffic flow behavior at off-ramps is critical to improve traffic management of urban expressways with better analysis. Drivers' queue-jump behavior near the off-ramp occurs frequently in the city of developing country, which contributes to the traffic complexity. However, the existing microscopic traffic simulation usually neglected drivers' queue-jump behaviors. So, multiple cellular automata based simulation model was built, which specifically targets on queue jump behaviors and the traffic spillback near expressway off-ramp, which the car is contained multiple cellular. Queue-jump rules are incorporated into the car-following and lane changing logics in the model. Using the model, different configurations around off-ramp in combination was simulated. The results show that, easy to recognizable pavement markers is designed to reduce the number of discretionary lane-changes, and multiple cellular cars in simulation reflects the traffic state better.

It is necessary to know the characteristics of the traffic flow on a single road when the road appears to the presence of emergency vehicles. This paper presents an analysis of the characteristics of the traffic flow on a single road when traffic passing through the roads there is an emergency vehicle. Or in other words the traffic flow on the single road is distorted by the emergency vehicles. The analysis is based on the queuing theory through simulation. The road segment observed is a single lane road. Construction of the model is a FIFO queue models, a single server with one service rate level and two-level arrival rate. Traffic conditions are modelled with M/M/1, M/G/1, and G/G/1. The simulation experiment result shows the presence of the emergency vehicles on the road do not affect too large the travel time of the normal traffic. Traffic with the smaller variance will result in the travel time of the normal traffic lower than the higher variance. The G/G/1 model shows the characteristics of the normal vehicles travel time and the emergency vehicles travel time lower than the M/M/1 model and M/G/1 model. The G/G/1 models with lower variance will result in the emergency vehicle travel time is closer to that expected.

A typical model of network with four three-line intersections is established by analyzing the confluence phenomenon, the divergence phenomenon and the extern dynamic input phenomenon, which appears in the actual traffic flow movement. The model depicts a transmission relation of traffic flow between different intersections efficiently. The timing schedule of traffic signal of the intersections can be optimized dynamically to reduce the average network delay and enhance the road capacity. In this study, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to optimize the timing schedule where the average network delay is considered as the objective of optimization. The simulation result shows that the proposed model of network can deal with the signal timing schedule of obstructed and unobstructed traffic phenomenon and the average network delay can be reduced efficiently.

Regardless of Despite its importance in macroscopic traffic flow modeling, comprehensive method for the calibration of fundamental diagram is very limited. Conventional empirical methods adopt a steady state analysis of the aggregated traffic data collected from measurement devices installed on a particular site to calibrate its fundamental diagram. Such kind of calibration methods do not consider the traffic dynamics, which renders the simulation may not be adaptive to the variability of measured data. Nonetheless, determining the fundamental diagram for each detection site is often infeasible. To remedy these, this study presents an automatic calibration method to estimate the parameters of a fundamental diagram through a dynamic approach. The process is conducted in an iterative manner that the fundamental diagram calibrated from last step is incorporated into the cell transmission model (CTM) to simulate its effect on traffic flow modeling. The simulated flow is compared against the measured flow wherein an optimization merit is conducted. The objective of this optimization is to minimize the discrepancy between model generated data and real data in terms of mean squared error based cost functions. The proposed method is validated by several empirical studies under both recurrent and abnormal traffic conditions. The empirical results prove that the proposed automatic calibration algorithm can significantly improve the accuracy of traffic state estimation and adapts to the variability of traffic data compared with several existing methods. The automatic calibration algorithm provides a powerful tool for model calibration when freeways are equipped with sparse detectors, new traffic surveillance systems lack of comprehensive traffic data or the case that lots of detectors lose their effectiveness for ageing systems even under abnormal traffic conditions such as accidents, special events, etc.	[Zhong Renxin; Chen Changjia; He Zhaocheng] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Sch Engn, Res Ctr Intelligent Transportat Syst, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yuan Fangfang] Sun Yat Sen Univ, Dept Automat Control, Guangzhou 510006, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Chow, Andy H.

Such human operators have experienced a wide variety of incidents and traffic congestions. But even the most experienced operators fail to control traffic efficiently during non-recurrent situations. Non-recurrent situation is a situation which has not been seen earlier by a human operator prior to its occurrence. Controlling traffic flow in such a situation is a complex task as it demands quick reaction and expert knowledge. This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach to control traffic flow in non-recurrent traffic situations. The proposed approach uses multiple techniques, most of which are borrowed from Soft Computing such as, NN (Neural Network), FL (Fuzzy Logic) and GA (Genetic Algorithm). This approach involves clustering imprecise data, in the form of Gaussian mixtures, into fuzzy sets using Expectation Maximization algorithm. The approach also includes minimizing the initial population of chromosomes in Genetic algorithm using a novel algorithm. The proposed algorithm used in identification of valid rules for fuzzy system reduces space and time complexity of the process. The proposed approach has been validated using METANET.

This is emphasized in the next generation science standards (NGSS) for high school engineering, where students are expected to engage with the global issues at the interface of science, technology, society and environment [4]. Study of traffic flow patterns is one such real-world problem domain that can stimulate student interest in STEM domains. To scaffold students' modeling and analysis of traffic flow, we have developed a suite of intuitive, easy-to-use and grade-appropriate tools that link problem solving to fundamental STEM concepts, and provide input and output interfaces to more complex and scaled up traffic simulation systems. We have developed a first prototype of the system, called (CSTEM)-S-3 (Challenge-based Community-centered Collaborative STEM learning environment) for ubiquitous learning in the classroom and outside. We evaluated an initial prototype of our system by introducing it to two groups of students. The first group of seven 10th and 11th grade students from a local Nashville High School, pursuing an Engineering track in their high school curriculum, worked on problems that combined math and science concepts. Using various components of our framework, the students first enhanced their knowledge of physics (Newton's laws) and mathematics (elementary calculus) and applied them to solve engineering problems related to reducing traffic congestion and maximizing vehicular throughput by traffic signal programming while experimenting with ranges of transportation parameters. The second group, nine middle school students attending a science summer camp in Chattanooga, TN, focused on the kinematics concepts associated with modeling traffic flow. Feedback from the students is helping us enhance the tool capabilities for use in a STEM curriculum at two high schools in summer and fall, 2014.

In this paper, we present a predictive road traffic management system (PRTMS) based on the Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) architecture. The proposed PRTMS uses a novel communications scheme to estimate the future traffic intensities at different intersections based on a modified linear prediction algorithm. Based on the prediction, a central controller reduces the congestion level by re-routing the vehicles and adaptively changing the signaling cycles. An IEEE 802.11p based vehicle toinfrastructure communications system is used to collect trip information and transmit control signals to enforce multi-junction traffic flow control. Simulations are conducted using an integrated OPNET model comprised of road infrastructure, vehicular mobility management and communications networking to jointly examine the performances of the proposed PRTMS and the VANET. The results indicate that the proposed scheme provides a significant performance improvement in terms of total journey time and waiting time of the vehicles. In addition, the performance of the prediction algorithm is also investigated.

In this paper we will briefly discuss the most important aspects of the topic, while also providing the interested reader with a non-exhaustive list of references that provide a more in-depth treatment of the subject. We start with a brief description of traffic management. Next, we discuss traffic flow and emission models, with an emphasis on macroscopic models, as they are well suited for on-line model-based predictive traffic control, highlighting the importance of the balance between accuracy and control performance. Next, we focus on the use of model-based predictive control (MPC) for coordinated control of various traffic control measures in small-scale freeway networks. Finally, we discuss various ways to improve the computation speed when solving the MPC optimization problem.

NOTICE uses belts of piezo-electric elements embedded in the highways to detect variations in the attributes of traffic flow. By using their piezo-electric elements the belts detect passing vehicles and initiate meaningful interaction with them. NOTICE learns about traffic conditions by collecting data from passing vehicles and, as a rule, this data is highly correlated. Thus, there is no need to collect data from all vehicles, especially in dense traffic, and one of the important issues we investigate in this work is probabilistic data collection where instead of collecting traffic-related data from all vehicle, the belt flips a coin and only collects data from a vehicle with some application dependent probability p. Vehicular Networks and Traffic-related systems are just like mission-oriented sensor networks, both are time varying systems consist of both humans and sensors that collect, communicate and coordinate to accomplish a near real-time solution or mission. The main contribution of this work is to analyze various parameters of probabilistic data collection in the NOTICE architecture and to reveal how they impact data aggregation and the time to detect traffic-related events.

It aims at discovering useful traffic patterns that can help decision makers better manage the transportation system and test and introduce new policies. Discovered patterns can also be used to support road users to reach their destination safely and with reasonable commuting time. In this paper, a number of key challenges associated with transportation systems and possible solutions are discussed. A method that analyzes real-time traffic data to predict future status of traffic flow and incidents is introduced. The proposed method includes three phases: offline, real-time, and decision support phases. In this paper, a decision tree classification model is constructed and validated for an accident dataset. Possible benefits of using the constructed model are demonstrated using results of the classification analysis.

The purposes of this paper are trifold. First, we provide an integrated framework for studying traffic prediction, data compression, abnormal data detection and missing data imputation problems, so that the relations between different problems can be revealed. In this part, we summarize several our works in this direction that had been finished in the last decade. Second, we discuss three most popular detrending methods: simple average detrending, principal component analysis (PCA) based detrending, as well as wavelet based detrending, and account for their intrinsic differences. Third, we present a new finding about trend modeling. We show that the detrending based prediction models previously designed for isolated sensor also work well for multiple sensors. Moreover, we define the so called short-term trend and explain why prediction accuracy can be improved at the points belonging to short trends, when the traffic information from multiple sensors is appropriately used. This new finding indicates that the trend modeling is not only a technique to specify the temporal pattern of traffic flow time series but is also related to the spatial relation of traffic flow time series.

However these sensors are uncommon in developing countries as they are embedded in the roads, and consequently expensive to deploy and impractical to implement on busy roads. Our novel method, VDZ with CCTV snap shots can provide the data needed to construct Fundamental Diagrams and able to show zero speeds at jam density, which provide essential parameters for macroscopic traffic model. The results obtained, without the use of any intrusive sensor, have shown agreement with previous traditional method.

The basic idea in the proposed approach is to switch between control laws computed offline on the basis of a nominal system model and a standard MPC scheme. Then, an offline computed control law is applied to the system until it maintains a suitable performance. This is verified by evaluating the property of natural robustness of the system by means of time-varying conditions depending on the system state and on the amplitude of exogenous perturbations. If the system behaviour, that is characterized by uncertainties, is evolving far from the nominal one, a classical MPC regulator is applied. In the paper, the control scheme is described and its effectiveness is evaluated through a numerical example.

Scheduling and Cooperative Control of Electric Vehicles' Charging at Highway Service Stations	2014 IEEE 53RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON DECISION AND CONTROL (CDC)	IEEE Conference on Decision and Control		English	Proceedings Paper	53rd IEEE Annual Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)	DEC 15-17, 2014	Los Angeles, CA	IEEE, MathWorks, Springer, Altair, dSPACE, Journal Franklin Inst, Soc Ind & Appl Math, United Technologies Res Ctr, Wolfram, EBSCO Informat Serv, Inst Engn & Technol, Now, Taylor & Francis, Cogent Engn			MODEL	Due to their limited ranges, electric vehicles (EVs) need to be periodically charged during their long-distance travels on a highway. Compared to the fossil-fuel powered vehicles, the charging of a single EV takes much more time (up to 30 mins versus 2 mins). As the number of EVs on highways increases, adequate charging infrastructure needs to be put in place. Nonetheless waiting times for EVs to get charged at service stations could still vary significantly unless an appropriate scheduling coordination is in place and individual EVs make correct decisions about their choice of charging locations. This paper attempts to address both the system-level scheduling problem and the individual control problem, while requiring only distributed information about EVs and their charging at service stations along a highway. Specifically, we first develop a higher-level distributed scheduling algorithm to optimize the operation of the overall charging network. The scheduling algorithm uses only local information of traffic flows measured at the neighboring service stations (nodes), and it aims at adjusting the percentage of the EVs to be charged at individual stations so that all the charging resources along the highway are well (uniformly) utilized and the total waiting time is minimized. Then, a lower level cooperative control law is designed for individual EVs to decide whether or not it should charge its battery when approaching a specific service station by meeting the published scheduling level while taking into account its own battery constraint. Analytical designs are presented and their performance improvement is illustrated using simulation.

However, these previous approaches do not accommodate realistic models for traffic density, flow, and velocity. The existing models also fail to uncover the relationships among energy efficiency, capacity, and safety. We investigate traffic networks from a system-level perspective. In result, we provide a time-gap based mathematical traffic model for vehicular traffic flow on highways. Our model explains the widely known triangular fundamental diagram, which represents vehicular traffic systems with the three primary parameters: maximum free-flow velocity, a typical safety length of vehicles, and a mean value of the time-gap of the traffic data during congested conditions. This result is also well validated with measured traffic data using least squares matching and with previous research outcomes about the propagation velocity. In addition, we suggest two distinct analysis techniques to estimate the time-gap from the traffic data measured on highways.

Car-following theory is a significant research direction in the field of VANET, it describes the one-by-one following process of vehicles on the same lane in traffic flow. The paper analyzed Krauss car-following model and proposed a new model based on the speed safe and Krauss model in SUMO 0.21.0 platform to improve the authenticity of model. We implement it on the SUMO platform. This model considers the movement state of the car and the gradual process of deceleration in vehicles braking. Simulation experimental results show the superiority of new model over other ones in simulation that models real streets. It achieves good results in wait time, travel time, lane-change number and safe speed.

Key intersection and public cycle time are determined by comparing cycle time of all intersections. Based on the spacing between adjacent intersections and path speed, signal timing and phase difference are adjusted so that some vehicles can go through multi intersections continuously. Two intersections of Xinhua road and Jianshe road, Xinhua road and Jianghan north road in Wuhan city as an example, simulation of signal timing for multi intersections is implemented based on the vissim software, results show that the average of queue length and delay time are decreased after optimization.

This model first uses gravity-based O-D estimation method to calculate the travel demand matrix of different sub regions. Second, this paper constructs a road network model on the basis of complex network and link resistance model to connect different traffic sub-zones. In addition, on the assumption that reasonable people usually choose the shortest path with minimum link resistance as their travel path, a mapping algorithm from travel demand to volume of traffic flow is introduced in our model. On the basis of the discrete-event simulation method, a simulation prototype system on PC is implemented. Experimental results show that this simulation system can simulate the dynamic evolution of travel demand and traffic flow in real time way and the model is effective.

Conventional solutions can hardly meet the requirements and expectations of domain experts. In this paper we present a data-driven solution by leveraging a visual analysis system to evaluate the real traffic situations based on taxi trajectory data. A sketch-based visual interface is designed to support dynamic query and visual reasoning of traffic situations within multiple coordinated views. In particular, we propose a novel road-based query model for analysts to interactively conduct evaluation tasks. This model is supported by a bi-directional hash structure, TripHash, which enables real-time responses to the data queries over a huge amount of trajectory data. Case studies with a real taxi GPS trajectory dataset (> 30GB) show that our system performs well for on-demand transport assessment and reasoning.

While extracting the high-dimensional, nonlinear and random features of the transportation network is a challenge, which is very useful to improve the accuracy of traffic prediction. In this paper, we propose DeepSense, a novel deep temporal-spatial traffic flow feature learning mechanism, with large scale Taxi GPS traces for traffic prediction. DeepSense includes two switchable feature learning approaches. DeepSense exploits a temporal-spatial deep learning approach for traffic flow prediction with the sufficient spatial and temporal taxi GPS traces in dynamic pattern. Meanwhile, DeepSense takes advantage of a supplementary temporal sequence segment matching approach with the temporal transformation of traffic flow state for a given road segment when there are not enough traffic traces. Experimental results show that DeepSense can achieve higher prediction accuracy with nearly 5% improvements compared with existing methods.

Taking a vacant taxi has become a difficult problem due to the imbalance between demand and supply of taxi service. People want to know where is better to wait for a vacant taxi in order to save their time in the fast-paced city life. Helpful information could be provided to the passengers by mining the historical GPS traces generated by taxis. In this paper, we propose a model based on taxi traffic flow (TTF) model to measure the difficulty of taking a vacant taxi on the road segments nearby. Furthermore, we calculate probability and expected waiting time of taking a vacant taxi based on TTF model. Afterwards, we detect the hotspots on the road segments expecting to offer more available information. Our research is based on the real historical taxi GPS data generated by 12000 taxis in Beijing. We conduct experiments to validate our model eventually and the experimental results are in line with the actual situation well relatively.

Optimizing Road Intersection Traffic Flow Using Stochastic and Heuristic Algorithms	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATIONS (ICC)	IEEE International Conference on Communications		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)	JUN 10-14, 2014	Sydney, AUSTRALIA	IEEE, IEEE Commun Soc, IEEE, New S Wales Sect		VANET; SPSA; heuristic algorithm; adaptive traffic light control	OPTIMIZATION	Vehicular Ad-hoc Network, VANET, offers new opportunities for better road traffic management. Using vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications, several research works were published on road traffic improvement in general and at road intersection in particular. One of the challenging problems is to minimize vehicles' waiting time at the intersection as well optimize traffic flow by adjusting the traffic signals timing. In this area, several methods have been proposed in the literature which can be classified as adaptive, heuristic, pre-timed and others. In these methods traffic density and statistical data are generally used to determine the traffic signals timing. However, these methods either don't offer an optimal solution or are not cost effective in terms of computational time. In this paper, we propose the use of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Algorithm (SPSA) to compute in real time the best traffic signals timing that minimizes the vehicles' travel time at the road intersection. A specific intersection in the city of Moncton with real traffic data was studied. Simulation results show a substantial improvement in term of vehicles' travel time in comparison with the pre-timed setting currently used by the city of Moncton. We also propose a heuristic algorithm which performs well too.

The section for a pedestrian to walk across the street is a conflict region if a vehicle is approaching that area where traffic lights are needed in order to protect pedestrians and also allow a smooth traffic flow. This research uses a multiagent method to build a simulation system to monitor how traffic lights affect the interaction between pedestrians and vehicles. By using agents, different kinds of pedestrians in different age and gender groups can be created to show a more realistic scenario of pedestrian reactions on the street. Agents control individual vehicles to simulate different driving possibilities. By using this system, we can adjust traffic lights differently to see how effective traffic lights can be set. By using agents, different research results on pedestrian models or vehicle models can be implemented independently and can be integrated in simulation. In addition, agents can also carry personal preferences to behave differently under different circumstances.

Several researches have been done related to this topic considering optimal locations of charging stations on road networks. In this paper, we extend the problem by also taking into account optimal locations of charging pads which uses inductive charging technology. Flow Refueling Location Model (FRLM) was proposed to maximize the refueled traffic flow by allocating a fixed number of facilities, e.g., gas stations. This paper extends FRLM to consider both charging station and charging pad allocation to maximize the recharged EV flow. Evaluation on a sample network shows that deploying charging pads on road network enables us to capture more traffic flow than locating charging stations only. Charging pad deployment also significantly shortens the charging time spent by EV drivers.

Electric Vehicles Charging Stations network - A preliminary evaluation about Italian Highways	2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE CONFERENCE (IEVC)			English	Proceedings Paper	2014 IEEE International Electric Vehicle Conference (IEVC)	DEC 17-19, 2014	Florence, ITALY			Electric Vehicle (EV); charging station network; Italian highways		Charging infrastructures have a fundamental role in the diffusion of Electrical Vehicles (EVs). An insufficient number of these could have negative effects on the EVs diffusion. This paper is going to analyze the Italian territory in order to provide an evaluation regarding the number of charging stations that Italian highways need. First of all attention was paid about the number of electrical vehicles situated in each Italian regions. Then, a cartographic study of the territory followed in order to identify the highways network and the traffic flow in it and a study of the main characteristics of the EVs over the past few years was carried. Finally, simulation results have demonstrated that the developed method supports the evaluation about the number of the charging stations that the Italian highways need.

In addition to measures to help vitalize this situation, the automotive sector is also working to resolve issues such as congestion and traffic accidents. With this background, this paper introduces two collaborative projects about intelligent vehicle research and development in Japan. The first project aims to develop an intelligent driving system to achieve a safe and secure traffic society for elderly drivers. The main purpose of this project is to realize an intelligent driving system incorporating an experienced driver model to help recover the deterioration in the recognition, decision-making, and operation capabilities of elderly drivers, and to achieve a significant improvement in road safety. The second is the Smart Traffic Flow Control Project. This project focuses on the fact that an advanced driver assistance system ( ADAS) with driving intelligence has the potential not only to enhance safe and secure driving but also to reduce congestion. This paper uses these topics to describe perspectives about intelligent vehicle technologies.

Naive Creature Learns to Cross a Highway in a Simulated CA-Like Environment	2014 IEEE SYMPOSIUM ON INTELLIGENT AGENTS (IA)			English	Proceedings Paper	2014 IEEE Symposium on Intelligent Agents (IA)	DEC 09-12, 2014	Orlando, FL	IEEE, IEEE Computat Intelligence Soc		autonomous robots; agents; cognitive agents; learning; cellular automata; global cellular automata; global cellular automata with write; Nagel-Schreckenberg model; computational intelligence	TRAFFIC FLOW; WAVES; MODEL	We present a model of simple cognitive agents, called "creatures", and their learning process, a type of "social observational learning", that is each creature learns from the behaviour of other creatures. The creatures may experience fear and/or desire, and are capable of evaluating if a strategy has been applied successfully and of applying this strategy again with small changes to a similar but new situation. The creatures are born as "tabula rasa"; i.e. without built-in knowledge base of their environment and as they learn they build this knowledge base. We study learning outcomes of a population of such creatures when they are learning how to safely cross various types of highways. The highways are implemented as a modified Nagel-Schreckenberg model, a CA based highway model, and each creature is provided with mechanism to reason to cross safely the highway. We present selected simulation results and their analysis.

The cooperative perception can provide upcoming traffic situations ahead, even beyond line-of-sight and field-of-view. From a control perspective, a spatial map for navigation planning is extended up to the boundary of connected vehicles in a see-through manner. By leveraging this augmented perception capability, a better driving decision can be accomplished in terms of traffic flow efficiency and safety improvement. For this purpose, we propose a mirror neuron inspired intention awareness algorithm along with planning and control methods using the algorithm. We demonstrate the feasibility of our proposals through simulations and experiments on the road.

Background transmissions are emitted by the majority of Wi-Fi-enabled devices by means of so called probe requests. We show by a real-world measurement on an Austrian motorway that a sufficient number of probe requests can be received in order to re-identify devices traveling between two locations and to estimate travel times. Our results show that by proper post-processing of measurement data, meaningful travel time information for the respective highway segment can be derived. We also propose a simple method to protect user privacy by pruning the recorded Wi-Fi device identifiers. Doing so allows us to generate travel time estimates without creating reversible relations between measurement data points and individual devices, which could potentially be linked to user identities. Obviously, using truncated identifiers has an impact on the estimation result. Based on the measurement data at hand we can show that there exists a fundamental trade-off between privacy and accuracy.

It is used to solve the multi-lane, open kinetic road traffic flow simulation problem. The Level of road Service (LOS) is used as the evaluation criteria. It is able to describe the behavior of the changes of the road flows, speeds, occupation ratios and other disturbance factors for the global road traffic flows. The simulation results show that the new model is more efficient and able to get better solutions than the kinetic system approach without disturbance.

To reach these goals electro mobility and V2X-communication are important key technologies. To reduce the emissions the automobile industry presented a quantity of electric car models during the last years. While the range of electric cars with about 150 km is adequate for inner city use, the battery-systems are not suitable for truck purpose. To enable electric driving also for long distance heavy goods vehicles ( HGV) SIEMENS developed the eHighway technology. While using the overhead contact line it is possible to continuously provide electric energy to the vehicle and thus drive environmentally cleaner and more energy efficient. With the V2X-equipment of the eHighway and the connection to the traffic control centre ( Conduct+) it is possible to increase the safety, the road capacity and to provide additional information for eHighway-user and all other V2X-equipped road users. While using the information from existing road sensors combined with the V2I-status-information of the road users, Conduct+ generates a holistic overview of traffic events. Via I2V Conduct+ advises the participants about changes in the traffic flow using in-vehicle signage. On a purpose-build test track SIEMENS and the DLR are proving the interaction of Conduct+, eHighway-infrastructure and V2X-equipped-eTrucks. This paper provides an insight into the eHighway-components and the functionality of the system components which enables the accumulation of traffic-data to enable an intelligent traffic control using V2X.

Current approaches address a variety of objectives including congestion management, collision avoidance, energy-efficiency and emission reduction. However, respective solutions typically are designed for and tailored to a predefined set of objectives. Consequently, the effects of drastically changing objectives cannot be assessed easily. To address this situation we present a lightweight approach to estimating multi-objective traffic flow early in systems engineering using non-deterministic models and stochastic optimization techniques. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a basic traffic scenario and conclude with future work.

Part of the solution to this problem is a system that can automatically detect the traffic congestion level in a road segment. This paper reports our work on developing such a system. It assumes a fixed camera is attached on high location, enabling it to monitor traffic flow in a specified road segment. The frame of video stream is analyzed by estimating the traffic density and traffic speed from the moving vehicles. The combination of traffic density and traffic speed is used for classifying the traffic congestion level, either belonging to free flow, slow moving or congestion category. Our evaluation using two traffic videos reveal a high accuracy of traffic congestion level prediction.

CTM (Cell Transmission Model) can describe exactly how traffic shock wave and queue form, yet off-ramp diversion coefficients are set to be time-invariant, which is not conform to the reality that is full of random events. Therefore, CTM could not practically meet the forecast demand. To address this problem, a hybrid modeling strategy based on both CTM and traffic flow diversion coefficients forecast is proposed in this paper. In the proposed method, traffic flow diversion coefficients are firstly forecasted using an advanced NN (Neural Network) with error compensation mechanism, and then CTM is used to forecast traffic state on the basis of the first step's predictions. Simulation results show that, the present model can obtain accurate predictions whose accuracy are 4.6 and 5.8 percent higher than CTM, reaching 92.6 and 93.2 percent, in terms of cell vehicle number and link traffic flow, respectively. For this reason, the present model can practically meet the forecast demand.

We find out that the keep-right-except-to-pass overtaking rule cannot increase the traffic flow effectively, but it can increase the safety of the road to some extent. Then we propose a new role "slow traffic keep right" to improve the performance of the original overtaking rule.

For instance, traffic flow monitoring at an intersection is one of these systems used for transportation network analysis. Main problems in intersection monitoring are vehicle detection and tracking. In this paper, we have developed and implemented a video-based vehicle detection and tracking system. The vehicle detection method is based on a combination of background estimation and dynamic texture modeling. After extracting vehicles from the video frames, a point tracking method has been used for prediction of vehicles' central points in the next frames. Weighted recursive least square has been used for point tracking purpose. Moreover, to solve the occlusion of two or more vehicles problem, fast normalized cross correlation algorithm has been used as a template matching method.

We establish the Keep-Right-Except-to-Pass (KRETP) model, which takes into consideration human behaviors when simulating the KRETP rule in both light and heavy traffic. In this model we divide drivers into two categories: active drivers and conservative drivers. Results shows that when compared with single-lane stochastic cellular automata (STCA) model, the KRETP model does not show any obvious difference in light traffic. In heavy traffic, the KRETP rule also barely improves traffic flow. When further examined under different traffic conditions, the KRETP shows that lane-changing frequency and the possibility of traffic accidents vary directly with traffic flow and inversely with traffic safety.

With predictive models, traffic states evolutions can be predicted, so VSL values can be optimized within model predictive control (MPC) frameworks to keep traffic flow at a high efficiency and suppress propagation of shockwaves, especially during congestion periods. METANET model is a widely used predictive tool, as well as its many extensions. In this paper, a new extension of METANET is proposed based on cooperative vehicle infrastructure system (CVIS), also known as vehicle-infrastructure integration (VII) system. By introducing vehicle models, vehicles' speed and position on each link are recorded, and prediction is changed to a mesoscopic scale, which describes the traffic entities at a high level of detail, but describes their behaviour and interactions at a lower level of detail (Van Woensel et al. 2007). Compared with previous studies that use macroscopic variables for prediction, the new model suits the situations in CVIS, where communication between vehicles and infrastructures will be adopted to replace variable message signs (VMS). Simulation results have shown the capacity of the proposed model in predicting state evolutions. Additionally, VSL's ability to improve traffic efficiency and prevent congestion propagation is proved. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Among various methods multitask neural network has been demonstrated to be a promising and effective model for traffic flow forecasting, while there are still two issues unconsidered: 1) learning unrelated tasks together tends to reduce the model's performance; 2) how to define or learn the distance metric for distinguishing related tasks and unrelated tasks. In this paper, a metric learning based K-means method is proposed to group related tasks together which effectively reduces the semantic gap between domain knowledge and handcrafted feature engineering. Then for each group of tasks, a deep neural network is built for traffic flow forecasting. Experimental results show the metric-based grouping method clusters tasks more reasonably with a better metric than classic Euclidean-based Kmeans. The final results of traffic flow forecasting on real dataset show the metric-based multi-task neural network outperforms the Euclidean-based multi-task neural network.

The forecasting result can be applied to support transportation system operation and management such as operation planning and revenue management. In this paper, a divide-and-conquer method based on neural network and origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation is developed to forecast the short-term passenger flow in high-speed railway system. There are three steps in the forecasting method. Firstly, the numbers of passengers who arrive at each station or depart from each station are obtained from historical passenger flow data, which are OD matrices in this paper. Secondly, short-term passenger flow forecasting of the numbers of passengers who arrive at each station or depart from each station based on neural network is realized. At last, the OD matrices in short-term time are obtained with an OD matrix estimation method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed divide-and-conquer method performs well in forecasting the short-term passenger flow on high-speed railway.

RFID TECHNOLOGY; MODEL; INTEGRATION	With the emergence of global markets, the efficiency of port operations has become a decisive factor for the economy and quality of global supply chains. After decades of streamlining terminal operations, ports still experience process and coordination problems due to a lack of information exchange and decision support. To improve the overall efficiency and quality of port operations, innovative information systems for gathering and processing operational data based on identification, sensing and mobile technologies are required to enhance the visibility of operations in information systems. A port-centric information system also requires the integration of external systems, such as traffic control systems, to further consider external factors. In this paper, we present a cloud-based system architecture for the real-time collection, management, and utilization of operational data with a particular focus on inter-terminal transportation. The proposed system architecture is based on widely adopted standards and utilizes the cost-effectiveness and scalability of a cloud computing infrastructure for processing large amounts of operational data. The information system lowers the bounded rationality of actors providing information and decision support as a service to the port community and other stakeholders. As such, this paper is intended to provide a conceptual view on a system for enhancing the management of real-time data to better manage traffic flows and transport modes, enhance the coordination between intra-terminal and interterminal/landside operations, and reduce empty handling processes.

Methods in this work combine mathematical derivation and simulation analysis. Based on cell transmission model the macroscopic models of arrival and departure air traffic flow in terminal area are established. Meanwhile, the interrelationship and influential factors of the three characteristic parameters as traffic flux, density, and velocity are presented. Then according to such models, the macro emergence of traffic flow evolution is emulated with the NetLogo simulation platform, and the correlativity of basic traffic flow parameters is deduced and verified by means of sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that there are remarkable relations among the three characteristic parameters of the air traffic flow in terminal area. Moreover, such relationships evolve distinctly with the flight procedures, control separations, and ATC strategies.

The time intervals between consecutive cars are supposed to be dependent and have different distribution. Cars with the slow and fast movement are distinguished in the traffic flow. The mathematical model of such traffic flow is represented as a control cybernetic system of a certain class. The methods to derive estimate for the parameters of the control cybernetic system are proposed in order to select the adequate traffic flow model in the form of batches flow. These methods are approved processing the statistical data of the Bartlett traffic flow. Effectiveness of suggested methods for the parameters estimation and algorithms for splitting a real traffic flow into the batches is demonstrated.

Accurate and reliable estimate of real-time traffic state is essential for optimizing network performance during unpredictable events. Inaccurate estimate of current traffic state produces unreliable travel-time estimations which lead to ineffective traffic management strategies during traffic incident. This study highlights the accuracy and reliability of traffic state estimate when a traffic flow prediction model is not provided with information about duration and impact of the incident on traffic flow capacity of the link. Cell Transmission Model (CTM) is used for prediction of traffic state and measurements from the sensor are combined in Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to minimize square of error between predicted and measured traffic state. A simple link is used to highlight the difference between actual traffic state and estimated traffic state using a naive prediction model for real-time traffic state estimation. Analysis of simulation results shows that estimate of traffic state is reliable and accurate for cells upstream of the measurement sensor when incident occurred downstream of measurement sensor. Whereas when incident location is upstream of measurement sensor, the estimated traffic state for downstream cells of measurement sensor is more close to actual traffic condition.

Drivers can have different origins and destinations, and different cost functions. Under natural assumptions, two main results have been established: (i) the existence of a globally optimal solution, minimizing the sum of the costs to all drivers, and (ii) the existence of a Nash equilibrium solution, where no driver can lower his own cost by changing his departure time or the route taken to reach destination. In the special case of one single road, the global optimum and the Nash equilibrium are uniquely determined.

In this model, a probability method is introduced to account for the stochastic variables in a driver's decision, which prove to be non-negligible factors from the results of simulation. We extend the speed control rules and overtaking rules in our model, and compare two different driving rules on the two-lane freeway in multiple speed distributions and different flow conditions. The results show a decrease in density when the expected average speed rises. The accident rate is examined in the model as well to study the security features, which reflects the trade-offs between traffic flow and safety. The probability of a driver's risk appetite and the probability of being a "rule-breaker" are taken into account respectively. By changing these variables, we further establish the relations between flow, density and safety, which enable us to analyze the impact of different rule-breaking behaviors.

Road network emissions have been calculated using standard factors taking into account details of vehicle fleet composition, average speeds and road type. Additionally, the use of microsimulation traffic modelling in conjunction with an instantaneous emissions model (IEM) has been adopted to allow comparison between methodologies and enable congestion sensitive analysis of the impact of air quality management measures on the network. Findings from microscale modelling have revealed that the use of an IEM to calculate emissions as an input for air quality dispersion modelling significantly improved the performance of the dispersion modelling when measured against monitored data. Moreover, this methodology has been successfully applied to assess the performance of a traffic scheme in Durham, UK.

The STN can be defined as the set of observations at neighbouring locations and times that are relevant for forecasting the future values of a series at a particular location at a particular time. Correct specification of the STN can enable forecasting models to capture spatio-temporal dependence, greatly improving predictive performance. In recent years, deficiencies have been revealed in models with globally fixed STN structures, which arise from the problems of heterogeneity, nonstationarity and nonlinearity in spatio-temporal processes. Using the example of a large dataset of travel times collected on London's road network, this study examines the effect of various STN selection methods drawn from the variable selection literature, varying from simple forward/backward subset selection to simultaneous shrinkage and selection operators. The results indicate that STN selection methods based on penalisation are effective. In particular, the maximum concave penalty (MCP) method selects parsimonious models that produce good forecasting performance.

Accurate counts can be used to determine the need for additional pedestrian walkways and intersection reorganization, among other planning initiatives. In this project, a camera-based approach is implemented to create a real-time pedestrian and cyclist counting system which is regularly accurate to 85% and often achieves higher accuracy. The approach retasks a state-of-the-art traffic camera, the Autoscope Solo Terra, for pedestrian and bicyclist counting. Object detection regions are sized to identify multiple pedestrians moving in either direction on an urban side walk and bicyclists in an adjacent bicycle lane. Collected results are processed in real time, eliminating the need for video storage and postprocessing. In this paper, results are presented for a pedestrian walkway for pedestrian flow up to 108 persons/min and the limitations of the implemented system are enumerated. Both pedestrian and cyclist counting accuracy of over 90% is achieved.

In light of this, the study suggests a calculation algorithm as a random test generator to simulate a steady state traffic flow and to provide time headways. Thanks to the outcome produced by numerical simulations, we analysed platoon distributions within traffic flows in a steady-state regime and showed the results of numerical analyses carried out by traffic random process functions. The laws to determine "time headways" were obtained by the Pearson type III generalized distribution.

We explore the related effects of gyroidal road upon uniform traffic flow analytically and numerically. The analytical result shows that the related factors of gyroidal road including the friction coefficient, radius of curvature and slope have great influences on the stability of the uniform flow respectively. The modified KdV (Korteweg-de Vries) equation is derived in the unstable area and the kink solution is obtained near the critical point. A series of simulations are conducted to verify the effects upon uniform traffic flow under different road conditions. It is shown that the amplitudes of the headway oscillation wave were affected by the friction coefficient, radius of curvature and slope respectively.

Complex traffic structure, imbalanced traffic flow, and uncertain event like road accident are among of the identified factors that may cause traffic congestion. Traffic congestion problem causes delay in travelling, increase in travelling cost and accident rate and may affect air pollution. Numerous approaches have been developed and proposed in solving these problems. Among them are traffic signal controls, congestion pricing, turning restrictions and traffic routing. Various methods have been employed include mathematical model, heuristic and meta-heuristics. This paper presents a review on recent approaches that have been proposed for traffic congestion problem and methods used for implementation. This review provides a bigger picture on recent approaches; provide a comparison and suggestion for future research in traffic congestion relief.

Due to the rapid development in urbanization, the complexity of traffic intersections provides challenges for researchers to detect the underlying traffic scenes. With the emerging video based surveillance system, vehicle trajectory can be extracted for observation and prediction via behavioral pattern learning. Prior to the learning, clustering of the extracted vehicle trajectory data is performed to group the data based on similarity measures. In this paper, the implementation of clustering algorithm on the trajectory data is analyzed and issues concerning the trajectory clustering are discussed.

The modeling scheme to predict highway traffic flow is proposed according to these features. The formulas for training wavelet neural network are deduced after the researches on learning process of wavelet neural network. The training algorithm and procedure for wavelet neural network are designed. The prediction model of highway traffic flow based on wavelet neural network is established. The model parameters are adjusted to achieve a good prediction result. The prediction result is tested by using actual traffic flow data. The result shows that the wavelet neural network can predict the highway traffic flow accurately.

Therefore, there is a great need for traffic management and awareness solutions. Many existing solutions are unsuitable for cities like Nairobi due to economic constraints, dynamic events, uncertainty, and poor infrastructure. Recently, a novel approach called Frugal Innovation has been adopted at IBM Tokyo Research. The approach combines very low quality images (VLQI) captured by existing low-cost cameras with network flow algorithms to accurately estimate traffic flow. We extend their work to develop a mobile app, called Twende-Twende, that provides drivers with real-time traffic information and suggested routes. We incorporate locally relevant context (such as references to landmarks) to predict congestion and create traffic awareness.

Traffic flow prediction using orthogonal arrays and Takagi-Sugeno neural fuzzy models	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2014 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)	IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)		English	Proceedings Paper	International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)	JUL 06-11, 2014	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE		Sensor configuration; traffic flow forecasting; Takagi-Sugeno neural fuzzy models; orthogonal array; experimental design methods	NETWORKS	Takagi-Sugeno neural fuzzy models (TS-models) have commonly been applied in the development of traffic flow predictors based on traffic flow data captured by the on-road sensors installed along a freeway. However, using all captured traffic flow data is ineffective for the TS-models for traffic flow predictions. Therefore, an appropriate on-road sensor configuration consisting of significant sensors is essential to develop an accurate TS-model for traffic flow forecasting. Although the trial and error method is usually used to determine the appropriate on-road sensor configuration, it is time-consuming and ineffective in trialing all individual configurations. In this paper, a systematic and effective experimental design method involving orthogonal arrays is used to determine appropriate on-road sensor configurations for TS-models. A case study was conducted based on the development of TS-models using traffic flow data captured by on-road sensors installed on a Western Australia freeway. Results show that an appropriate on-road sensor configuration for the TS-model can be developed in a reasonable amount of time when an orthogonal array is used. Also, the developed TS-model can generate accurate traffic flow forecasting.

Traditional process neural network is usually limited in structure of single hidden layer due to the unfavorable training strategies of neural network with multiple hidden layers and complex temporal weights in process neural network. Deep learning has emerged as an effective pre-training method for neural network with multiple hidden layers. Though deep learning is usually limited in static inputs, it provided us a good solution for training neural network with multiple hidden layers. In this paper, we extended process neural network to deep process neural network. Two basic structures of deep process neural network are discussed. One is the accumulation first deep process neural network and the other is accumulation last deep process neural network. We could build any architecture of deep process neural network based on those two structures. Temporal process inputs are represented as sequences in this work for the purpose of unsupervised feature learning with less prior knowledge. Based on this, we proposed learning algorithms for two basic structures inspired by the numerical learning approach for process neural network and the auto-encoder in deep learning. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrated that deep process neural network is effective in tasks with temporal process inputs. Accuracy of deep process neural network is higher than traditional process neural network while time complexity is near in the task of traffic flow prediction in highway system.

International aid is being provided to construct modern traffic signal infrastructure. But often such an infrastructure does not work well due to the high operating and maintenance costs and the limited knowledge of the local engineers. In this paper, we propose a frugal signal control framework that uses image analysis to estimate traffic flows. It requires only low-cost Web cameras to support a signal control strategy based on the current traffic volume. We can estimate the traffic volumes of the roads near the traffic signals from a few observed points and then adjust the signal control. Through numerical experiments, we confirmed that the proposed framework can reduce an average travel time 20.6% compared to a fixed-time signal control even though the Web cameras are located at 500 m away from intersections.

Aiming at considering simultaneously the bridge-traffic coupling effects and various sources of nonlinearity on the bridge structure, a new time-domain simulation methodology for the system of long-span bridges and moving traffic subjected to spatially-varyingground motion excitations is established. The methodology involves two analytical models, which are the fully-coupled bridge-traffic interaction model based on the mode coordinates and the three dimensional finite element model developed in a commercial program. Different from most existing studies, the fully-coupled bridge-traffic interaction analysis is conducted by coupling the modal-based bridge model, all individual moving vehicles of the stochastic traffic flow, roughness excitation and seismic excitations simultaneously. The fully-coupled bridge-traffic interaction analysis is firstly conducted using mode superposition method to obtain the dynamic response of bridge and moving vehicles subjected to spatially-varyingearthquake excitations, which are simulated by the spectral representation method as one-dimensional, n-variate non-stationary Gaussian random process with a mean value of zero based on a scenario earthquake. The equivalent moving traffic load (EMTL) with respect to time is further obtained based on the stiffness and damping parameters of vehicles and relative displacement of vehicle and bridge at contact point. The time histories of EMTL at bridge deck joints are applied on the bridge finite element model in commercial finite element software for nonlinear seismic analysis. Numerical analysisis further conducted on the prototype long-span cable-stayed bridge and stochastic traffic system subjected to spatially-varying ground motions.

The studied perimeter is situated at the Western edge of the city of Cluj Napoca, Romania, on the borderline between urban and suburban areas. At the moment, the European E60 road is the only functional road link which connects the city to the Western suburb of Floresti. Population increase and suburban expansion led to high traffic volumes, especially during the morning and afternoon commuting peak hours. As traffic is expected to further increase in the future, we conducted this comparative study to see which solution would have the best impact on traffic conditions in the studied area. The traffic data we used was collected by a high-speed weigh-in-motion system, installed on the studied E60 road link. We used this real measured data to make a 15-years traffic forecast, based on Romanian regulations. After observing that road capacity has already started to be exceeded during peak hours, we studied two possible traffic flow improvement scenarios. In order to obtain a better look on the impact of the proposed measures, we studied a broader area, including parts of the adjacent neighbourhoods. The computer-based transport modelling and traffic assignment was done using Citilabs' Cube Voyager software. After setting up the road network and modelling the existing situation, we evaluated the impact of each scenario on the traffic volumes, route assignments and travel times. Results show the differences between the existing traffic conditions and the proposed possible future scenarios, which could be adopted to improve the level of service of the streets in the studied area. In the end, we reached a conclusion regarding the recommended solution.

Therefore, a smart, iterative design process must be started. Taking into account future structural changes and demand shifts, a target timetable is created. First, a demand model for the planning area is set up and calibrated against the current traffic flows of both public transport (train and bus) and individual transport. Second, a prediction of future population changes and structure developments (settlement and road infrastructure) is set up and woven into the demand model. Third, the demand model is fed with the future data and the current timetable to check the development without measures. Fourth, a sensitivity analysis of competing timetable models is checked against the demand model; a detailed analysis of these results is then taken to optimise the best-ranked timetable model. Next, the design of a more detailed timetable can start. By means of an integrated timetable model, the operationally necessary riding times between hubs as well as along the track are defined as well as the rough location of two-track sections. These parameters are then taken over to check infrastructure as well as vehicle options to achieve these goals. In a project-wise analysis, the optimal combination of infrastructure measures is then obtained to be able to run the predicted timetable. Since this timetable has been put beyond dispute beforehand, every single infrastructure measure can be justified including all consequences that result from its implementation. This results in a step-by-step upgrade plan and a definitely optimal, long-term and timetable-based infrastructure development perspective.

Many roads and intersections fail to meet the increasing demands of traffic and thus contribute to an unstable and inefficient traffic flow, increased number of traffic accidents, environmental pollution and the resulting adverse impact on the economy. Among many solutions, roundabouts have proved themselves in many cases to be one of the most successful. In this study the research was conducted on newly built roundabouts that replaced traffic light signalized and unsignalized intersections at two locations in the town of Vinkovci. Collected traffic and project data were analyzed and processed with the help of aaSIDRA analytic deterministic model in order to obtain comparison results for fuel consumption, waiting time and harmful exhaust emissions of CO2, NOx, CO and HC for the past and present state of the intersection. After comparing the results, it was concluded that the new roundabouts have proved themselves as the best solution for reducing adverse effects of traffic and, as such, represent the future of further construction.

It is well known that the specific deceleration and acceleration dynamics of traffic at road intersections can cause different noise levels than free-flow traffic on open road segments. Also, each intersection type has variously distributed sections with different traffic flow conditions: constant speed, stop and go, deceleration and acceleration. The aim of research described in this paper is to establish whether the design of road intersection has influence on traffic noise emissions and to establish which intersection type is most suitable for application in urban areas, where residential buildings are often placed directly next to the noise source in this case, the intersection. Models used for noise modeling in this research consist of two identical intersecting roads connected as follows, by mini roundabout and by intersection with or without traffic lights. Traffic noise calculations were conducted by means of specialized noise prediction software LimA using modified static noise calculation method RLS 90. Accuracy of roundabout noise model described in this paper had been verified in previous studies by comparison of measured noise levels and calculated noise levels on a number of urban roundabouts.

A road network is modelled using a directed graph, consisting of typical roads and junctions, with different traffic flow inputs throughout the day. The model is based on a simple idea of balancing out the traffic flow in the network, considering the capacity of an individual road and traffic overflow through to the related junctions. The evolution of traffic flows and queues in a two-way traffic flow is modelled using an iterative simulation method. The model is used to forecast travel delays and evaluate the network performance in normal conditions and when maintenance works are implemented. The paper illustrates how to calculate travel delays on the network throughout the day, how to estimate the effects of road maintenance works and how to use the results to plan maintenance on the network.

Intelligent Advisory Speed Limit Dedication in Highway Using VANET	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							OPERATIONAL IMPACTS; ROAD; SAFETY; SYSTEM; ALGORITHM; DRIVERS; CRASHES	Variable speed limits (VSLs) as a mean for enhancing road traffic safety are studied for decades to modify the speed limit based on the prevailing road circumstances. In this study the pros and cons of VSL systems and their effects on traffic controlling efficiency are summarized. Despite the potential effectiveness of utilizing VSLs, we have witnessed that the effectiveness of this system is impacted by factors such as VSL control strategy used and the level of driver compliance. Hence, the proposed approach called Intelligent Advisory Speed Limit Dedication (IASLD) as the novel VSL control strategy which considers the driver compliance aims to improve the traffic flow and occupancy of vehicles in addition to amelioration of vehicle's travel times. The IASLD provides the advisory speed limit for each vehicle exclusively based on the vehicle's characteristics including the vehicle type, size, and safety capabilities as well as traffic and weather conditions. The proposed approach takes advantage of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) to accelerate its performance, in the way that simulation results demonstrate the reduction of incident detection time up to 31.2% in comparison with traditional VSL strategy. The simulation results similarly indicate the improvement of traffic flow efficiency, occupancy, and travel time in different conditions.

J	Guzman, AF; Vassallo, JM				Felipe Guzman, Andres; Manuel Vassallo, Jose			Impact of Introducing Longer and Heavier Vehicles on Regional Consumer Price Index and Spanish Road Freight Transport System	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							COSTS	This paper applies an integrated modeling approach to the case of Spain; the approach is based on a random utility-based multiregional input-output model and a road transport network model for assessing the effect of introducing longer and heavier vehicles (LHVs) on the regional consumer price index (CPI) and on the transportation system. The approach strongly supports the concept that changes in transport costs derived from the LHV allowance as well as the economic structure of regions have direct and indirect effects on the economy and on the transportation system. Results show that the introduction of LHVs might reduce prices paid by consumers for a representative basket of goods and services in the regions of Spain and would also lead to a reduction in the regional CPL In addition, the magnitude and extent of changes in the transportation system are estimated by using the commodity-based structure of the approach to identify the effect of traffic changes on traffic flows and on pollutant emissions over the whole network.

However, the rich data from probe vehicles that have become available in recent years can assist with such traffic monitoring. Hydrodynamic theory and horizontal queuing theory are used to derive the joint probability distribution function of vehicle location and speed on an arterial road for undersaturated and congested traffic conditions. Specifically considered are the effects of signal controllers (including deceleration, acceleration, and queuing) on the distributions of location and speed. This probabilistic model is parameterized by link parameters (red signal time, cycle time, and critical flow density), driving behavior (average deceleration and acceleration, average speed, and variation of arrival flow and dissipating flow), and traffic state (arrival flow density) obtained from historical probe data (for location and speed) with maximum likelihood estimates. In a numerical experiment with data collected from private cars in Toyota City, Japan, for the 2011 Green Project, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test validates the use of the proposed distributions of vehicle location and speed.

Some previous studies either assumed that the points of congested traffic flows were completely random or that the implicit rules of hidden distribution were difficult to describe. Although the scattering features are influenced by various factors (e. g. lane-changing manoeuvers, merging behaviours and driver heterogeneity), we believe that they are mainly dominated by the microscopic headway/spacing distributions. In this paper, we relax the assumption of deterministic headway/spacing in Newell's simplified car-following model and allow random headways/spacings in a homogeneous platoon (vehicles run closely at the same velocity). Further extending the conventional deterministic reciprocal relationship between flow rate and headway, we find that the reciprocal of average headway of a homogeneous platoon and the corresponding flow rate should follow the same distribution. Based on these two extensions, we can link the conditional distributions of average headway in a homogeneous platoon and the conditional distributions of flow rate, all with respect to velocity. When the aggregation time interval is small enough (e. g. 30 s), tests on Performance Measurement System (PeMS) data reveal that the seemingly disorderly scattering points in the macroscopic flow-density plot follow the estimated flow rate distributions from Next Generation Simulation vehicular trajectories. While if the aggregation time interval increases (e. g. to 5 min), the measured vehicles probably pass the loop detectors at different velocities and form heterogeneous platoons. It becomes difficult to find a definite distribution model that can fit average headway/spacing for heterogeneous platoons. However, most points in flow-velocity plot still locate within a certain 2D region, whose boundaries can be obtained from the homogeneous platoon model. Finally, tests on PeMS data verify the estimated boundaries.

In this paper an asymmetric two-lanes cellular automata (CA) model for traffic flow is presented. The aim is to reproduce the actual usage of twolanes highway space and to make the lane change modeling more in line with reality, when different types of vehicles are considered. For this purpose, the model determines both the utility of a given lane change and the risk associated with it, by means of a set of lane changing rules in terms of accelerations and safe braking distances. Simulation results on a system with periodic conditions and two types of vehicles with different length and different limited velocities are realized. In contrast to the most CA model existing in the literature, it is shown that the traffic flow is not dominated by the introduction of large vehicles with small maximum velocity, when the change of lane is not prohibited for them, and the lane usage inversion observed in the reality is still reproduced. Moreover, the model avoids, at least partially, multiple lane-changes of vehicles in consecutive time-steps. The model preserves the computational simplicity of CA traffic models, that makes real time implementation feasible.

This paper presents an exhaustive intersection control applicable for continuous traffic simulators. Our work contains many types of road crossings and junctions occurring in real road networks, including unregulated intersections without prioritization (right-beforeleft rule), traffic light controlled ones, intersections regulated with road signs and combinations of them with different numbers of road segments inwards and outwards. Special situations such as route changes before intersections and multi-lane situations are addressed. The models are implemented for the continuous traffic simulator TraffSim, which demonstrates their applicability and range of features. With the introduced set of rules and situations, a great majority of intersections of real road networks can be parametrized and simulated virtually and the requirements for traffic flow investigations through dynamic simulations are fulfilled.

J	Wu, JJ; Sun, HJ				Wu Jianjun; Sun Huijun			Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of Mixed Traffic Flow Time Series with a Blockage	COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-SIMULATION AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Blockage; Detrended fluctuation analysis; Mixed traffic flow; Time series	LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON; MODEL; SYSTEMS; WAVE	Finding the influence of traffic accident on the road is helpful to analyze the characteristics of traffic flow, and take reasonable and effective control measures. Here, the detrended fluctuation analysis method is applied to investigate the complexity of time series in mixed traffic flow with a blockage induced by an accident. As a parameter to depict the long-term evolutionary behavior of the time series in traffic flow, the scaling exponent is analyzed. According to the scaling exponent, it is shown that the traffic flow time series can display long-range correlation characteristics, short-range correlation characteristics, and non-power-law relation in the long-range correlation characteristics, which is strongly dependent on the entering probability of vehicle, the ratio of slow vehicle and the blockage duration time.

The numerical results show that the road capacity destroys the stability of uniform flow and produces stop-and-go traffic under a moderate density and that the road capacity enhances the traffic risk coefficient and reduces the traffic system's reliability. In addition, the numerical results show that properly improving the road condition can enhance the road capacity, reduce the traffic risk coefficient and enhance the traffic system's reliability.

J	Buric, L; Janovsky, V				Buric, Lubor; Janovsky, Vladimir			A traffic flow model with overtaking as a Filippov system	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Road traffic; Microscopic models; Overtaking; Dynamical systems; Piecewise smooth dynamics	REACTION-TIME	We investigate microscopic models of road traffic. In particular, we consider a car-following model for a single-line traffic flow of N identical cars on a circular road. The classical differentiable model breaks down at the time instant when two cars collide. However, the natural action of a driver would be to overtake a slower car. In our previous work, we proposed a model which simulates the overtaking. We observed a large variety of oscillatory solutions (oscillatory patterns) of the model. In the present contribution, we formulate our model as a particular Filippov system, i.e., ODEs with discontinuous right hand sides. Hence, we can identify our problem with a well defined solution class. We define oscillatory patterns as invariant objects of this Filippov system. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, seldom strategies have considered the information delay and user equilibrium (UE) objective. Here, a derivative cost feedback strategy (DCFS) is proposed to reduce the influence of the delay, based on the UE principle. The simulation results show that in both no-delay and delay information cases, DCFS are the best and can make the system reaching the UE. Because DCFS can predict the trend of the travel cost.

The linear stability analysis and nonlinear analysis show that the driver anticipation effect of next-nearest-neighbor site can enlarge the stable area of traffic flow. The space can be divided into three regions: stable, metastable, and unstable. Numerical simulation further illuminates that the driver anticipation effect of the next-nearest-neighbor site can stabilize traffic flow in our modified lattice model, which is consistent with the analytical results.

Pedestrians' estimates of their own nighttime conspicuity are unaffected by severe reductions in headlight illumination	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						Pedestrians; Driving; Night vision; Conspicuity; Headlamps	TRAFFIC SAFETY; VISIBILITY; DEGRADATION; FREQUENCY; ACCIDENTS; DRIVERS	Introduction: At night pedestrians tend to overestimate their conspicuity to oncoming drivers, but little is known about factors affecting pedestrians' conspicuity estimates. This study examines how headlamp intensity and pedestrians' clothing influence judgments of their own conspicuity. Method: Forty-eight undergraduate students estimated their own conspicuity on an unilluminated closed road by walking in front of a stationary vehicle to the point at which they judged that they were just recognizable to the driver. Unknown to the participants, high beam intensity was manipulated between subjects by placing neutral density filters on the headlamps. Results: Estimated conspicuity distances did not significantly vary with changes in headlamp intensity even when only 3% of the illumination from the headlamps was present. Practical applications: These findings underscore the need to educate pedestrians about the visual challenges that drivers face at night and the need to minimize pedestrians' exposure to traffic flow at night.

Furthermore, computer numerical simulation result indicates that the procedure of sensitive lane change can effectively reduce the lane change ratio of the straight moving vehicles, thus obviously it has an inhibitory effect on unnecessary lane change; what is more, the longer the sensitive lane change zone, the more effective the inhibitory function is. However, the traffic signs at ramp cannot be set as far as possible. Lower the lane change ratio is, shorter the sensitive lane change zone needed is. The traffic signs at ramp are set with proper distance according to the lane change ratio can effectively increase systematic traffic flow as well as the critical entrance probability.

To embody the features of bicycles and riders, the repulsive force among the riders and the velocity effect are taken into consideration in this new model. A new concept called lane-changing cost is proposed to study the effect of driving styles, and a new lane-changing rule is proposed based on the traffic environment comparison. The simulation results show that 1) the model can accurately describe the bicycle flow, and the obtained statistics accords with empirical data; 2) the capacity of the road of per unit width deceases as road-width increases; 3) aggressive driving style substantially increases the lane-changing times, which reduces the capacity of the road.

This study describes a preliminary study on an automated on-ramp merging control algorithm for vehicles on freeways under condition of Internet-connected vehicles. On the basis of vehicular operation characteristics during the merging process analysis, a cooperative driving algorithm based on Internet of vehicles was designed to achieve ramp merging without collision. Then two on-ramp merging cases, including one vehicle and two vehicles merging into the platoon on main lane, were discussed in detail. Simulation works were carried out and the results proved that the on-ramp merging algorithm was effective, but the vehicle following the leading vehicle on ramp lane is disturbed seriously by the leading vehicle. At the same time, the simulation results also showed the scenario that merging a platoon into the two vehicles on main lane affects the traffic flow more seriously than letting each individual vehicle on ramp lane consecutively to merge in between the two vehicles in the main lane under the same initial condition.

This study presents two dynamic speed guidance (DSG) strategies based on the traffic environment and facility deployment to congregate the traffic flow and optimise the arterial coordinated signal control system. One of them is the in-car display for individual guidance, and the other is the roadside display for group guidance. The two DSG strategies are calculated using the rolling horizon approach. A simulation platform that integrates data communication, traffic mobility and DSG application is programmed based on VISSIM, a microscopic simulation model. A section of Cao'an highway is used to assess the efficiency of two DSG strategies. The assessment results show that both the average stops and travel time of arterial vehicles can be optimised with the application of the two DSG strategies. In addition, the in-car strategy provides a significant benefit for on-board unit equipped vehicles, even in a low level of market penetration rate.

Historical loop detector data for sideswipe crashes and corresponding non-crash cases were collected from Interstate-894 in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. Two sets of significant explanatory features were aggregated from the collected detector data to capture the prevailing traffic state and variances between adjacent lanes. Then, three SVMs with different nonlinear kernel function were formulated with the significant features as inputs. To comparatively evaluate the performance of SVM models against other commonly applied crash potential predictors, the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network models were also developed to predict sideswipe crash potential. The results showed that SVM models offers similar overall accuracy as the premier MLP model, but SVMs achieved better sideswipe crash identification at higher false alarm rates. The research also investigated the potential of using the SVM model for evaluating the impacts of traffic factors on sideswipe crash. Sensitivity analysis conducted on the trained SVM models successfully identified the variables' impact on sideswipe crash. These results affirmed the superior performance of SVM technique in crash potential prediction analysis.

Travel reliability, related to the flow breakdown probability, is conveyed to drivers in the form of a dynamic toll, for consideration in their route selection. In addition, to manage the traffic proactively a rolling horizon approach is used to generate dynamic tolls based on predicted traffic conditions. The experimental results show that anticipatory reliability tolls could divert travellers away from actual or likely bottlenecks that experience unstable flow, and thus contribute to reducing congestion on toll roads and increasing system utilisation.

Impact of distracted driving on safety and traffic flow	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Distracted driving; Safety; Traffic flow; Driving simulation	CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; PERFORMANCE; DRIVER; CRASHES	Studies have documented a link between distracted driving and diminished safety; however, an association between distracted driving and traffic congestion has not been investigated in depth. The present study examined the behavior of teens and young adults operating a driving simulator while engaged in various distractions (i.e., cell phone, texting, and undistracted) and driving conditions (i.e., free flow, stable flow, and oversaturation). Seventy five participants 16-25 years of age (split into 2 groups: novice drivers and young adults) drove a STISIM simulator three times, each time with one of three randomly presented distractions. Each drive was designed to represent daytime scenery on a 4 lane divided roadway and included three equal roadway portions representing Levels of Service (LOS) A, C, and E as defined in the 2000 Highway Capacity Manual. Participants also completed questionnaires documenting demographics and driving history. Both safety and traffic flow related driving outcomes were considered. A Repeated Measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance was employed to analyze continuous outcome variables and a Generalized Estimate Equation (GEE) Poisson model was used to analyze count variables. Results revealed that, in general more lane deviations and crashes occurred during texting. Distraction (in most cases, text messaging) had a significantly negative impact on traffic flow, such that participants exhibited greater fluctuation in speed, changed lanes significantly fewer times, and took longer to complete the scenario. In turn, more simulated vehicles passed the participant drivers while they were texting or talking on a cell phone than while undistracted. The results indicate that distracted driving, particularly texting, may lead to reduced safety and traffic flow, thus having a negative impact on traffic operations. No significant differences were detected between age groups, suggesting that all drivers, regardless of age, may drive in a manner that impacts safety and traffic flow negatively when distracted.

Jeffrey			Low-wind and other microclimatic factors in near-road black carbon variability: A case study and assessment implications	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Black carbon; On-road traffic emission; Gaussian dispersion; Near-road transport; Climate change	SULFATE DISPERSION EXPERIMENT; AEROSOL-PARTICLES; AIR-QUALITY; ULTRAFINE PARTICLES; OPTICAL-ABSORPTION; BOUNDARY-LAYER; MODEL; PLUME; ATMOSPHERE; HIGHWAY	Airborne black carbon from urban traffic is a climate forcing agent and has been associated with health risks to near-road populations. In this paper, we describe a case study of black carbon concentration and compositional variability at and near a traffic-laden multi-lane highway in Cincinnati, Ohio, using an onsite aethalometer and filter-based NIOSH Method 5040 measurements; the former measured 1-min average black carbon concentrations and the latter determined the levels of organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) averaged over an approximately 2-h time interval. The results show significant wind and temperature effects on black carbon concentration and composition in a way more complex than predicted by Gaussian dispersion models. Under oblique low winds, namely u(x)[= u x sin(theta)] similar to (0, -0.5 m s(-1)), which mostly occurred during morning hours, black carbon concentrations per unit traffic flow were highest and had large variation. The variability did not always follow Gaussian dispersion but was characteristic of a uniform distribution at a near-road distance. Under all other wind conditions, the near-road black carbon variation met Gaussian dispersion characteristics. Significant differences in roadside dispersion are observed between DC and EC fractions, between PM2.5 and PM10-2.5, and between the morning period and rest of the day. In a general case, the overall black carbon variability at the multi-lane highway can be stated as bimodal consisting of Gaussian dispersion and non-Gaussian uniform distribution. Transition between the two types depends on wind velocity and wind angle to the traffic flow. In the order of decreasing importance, the microclimatic controlling factors over the black carbon variability are: 1) wind velocity and the angle with traffic; 2) diurnal temperature variations due to thermal buoyancy; and 3) downwind Gaussian dispersion. Combinations of these factors may have created various traffic-microclimate interactions that have significant impact on near-road black carbon transport. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Rahman, M; Chowdhury, M; Xie, YC; He, YM				Rahman, Mizanur; Chowdhury, Mashrur; Xie, Yuanchang; He, Yiming			Review of Microscopic Lane-Changing Models and Future Research Opportunities	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Review						Driver behavior; lane-changing models	MULTILANE TRAFFIC FLOW; COLLISION-AVOIDANCE; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DRIVING BEHAVIOR; SIMULATION; 2-LANE; DENSITY; MOTORWAY; SYSTEMS	Driver behaviors, particularly lane-changing behaviors, have an important effect on the safety and throughput of the roadway-vehicle-based transportation system. Lane-changing models are a vital component of various microscopic traffic simulation tools, which are extensively used and playing an increasingly important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems studies. The authors conducted a detailed review and systematic comparison of existing microscopic lane-changing models that are related to roadway traffic simulation to provide a better understanding of respective properties, including strengths and weaknesses of the lane-changing models, and to identify potential for model improvement using existing and emerging data collection technologies. Many models have been developed in the last few decades to capture the uncertainty in lane change modeling; however, lane-changing behavior in the real world is very complex due to driver distraction (e. g., texting and cellphone or smartphone use) and environmental (e. g., pavement and lighting conditions) and geometric (e. g., horizontal and vertical curves) factors of the roadway, which have not been adequately considered in existing models. Therefore, large and detailed microscopic vehicle trajectory data sets are needed to develop new lane changing models that address these issues, and to calibrate and validate lane-changing models for representing the real world reliably. Possible measures to improve the accuracy and reliability of lane-changing models are also discussed in this paper.

J	Cho, S				Cho, Seongkil			Revisiting shock wave theory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						mathematical modelling; roads & highways; traffic engineering	TRAFFIC FLOW; DYNAMICS	According to Lighthill and Whitham's shock wave model, there exists a shock wave even in a homogeneous speed condition. They referred to this wave as unobservable, that is analogous to a radio wave that cannot be seen. Other researchers described this wave as an imaginary but useful analytical tool. This paper initially attempted to identify how such a counterintuitive conclusion resulted in Lighthill and Whitham's shock wave model. It is shown that the existing shock wave model significantly relaxed the speed-space relationship change in accordance with the flow condition during the formulation of the model. A new model is derived in later parts of the paper by deploying stringent speed-space relationships between two consecutive vehicles in traffic. In the new model, the shock wave in a homogeneous speed traffic stream is identical to the ambient vehicle speed, and thus no radio-wave-like shock wave existed.

J	Mauro, R; Giuffre, O; Grana, A				Mauro, Raffaele; Giuffre, Orazio; Grana, Anna			Speed Stochastic Processes and Freeway Reliability Estimation: Evidence from the A22 Freeway, Italy	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Highways and roads; Optimization; Italy; Stochastic processes; Traffic speed; Freeway; Reliability; Spot speed process; Transport optimization	CAPACITY; MODELS; SYSTEM	In this paper, a criterion for predicting the reliability of freeway traffic flow is presented. The idea is based on an analysis of spot speed time series divided into sequences of events of random and homogeneous traffic processes. For each process, the flow rate and density were calculated; then the relationships between parameters of spot speed processes and vehicular density were obtained. Using these relationships and a simulation procedure for the spot speed process, a formulation for predicting the reliability of traffic flow moving along the offside lane on the freeway roadway was derived. Through this formulation and the measurements of flow rate and speed, the probability of instability of the roadway under examination was calculated. Furthermore, with an inverse procedure, the capacity of a lane was estimated: setting the reliability value close to 1 and considering a 15min interval, the resulting flow rate represented the capacity. Thus, the simulation procedure was used to provide, in real time, the incoming instability conditions on the roadway and to estimate roadway capacity for the A22 Brenner Freeway, Italy.

An improved cellular automaton model with the consideration of a multi-point tollbooth	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multi-point tollbooth; Traffic flow; Cellular automaton	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; MACRO MODEL; CONTINUUM MODEL; HIGHWAY; DRIVERS	Based on the classical Nagel-Schreckenberg model, we in this paper propose an improved cellular automaton (CA) model to study the influences of a multi-point tollbooth on traffic flow. The numerical results show that the multi-point tollbooth can be looked at as a bottle-neck and that it can improve the road capacity compared with other tolling stations, which shows that the proposed model is more effective than other traffic flow models. In addition, the results can help readers to better understand the effects of a multi-point tollbooth on traffic flow and help traffic engineers to reasonably design the tolling station.

To reduce traffic delays and traffic emissions for urban traffic networks, this paper first proposes an integrated macroscopic traffic model that integrates a macroscopic urban traffic flow model with a microscopic traffic emission model for individual vehicles. This integrated model is able to predict the traffic flow states and the emissions released by every vehicle at different operational conditions, i.e., the speed and the acceleration. Then, model predictive control (MPC) is applied to control urban traffic networks based on this integrated traffic model, aiming at reducing both travel delays and traffic emissions of different gases. Finally, simulations are performed to assess this multiobjective control approach. The obtained simulation results illustrate the control effects of the model predictive controller.

Supervised Weighting-Online Learning Algorithm for Short-Term Traffic Flow Prediction	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); online learning weighted support-vector regression (OLWSVR); short-term traffic flow forecast; supervised algorithm	TRAVEL-TIME PREDICTION; NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; VOLUME; MODEL	Prediction of short-term traffic flow has become one of the major research fields in intelligent transportation systems. Accurately estimated traffic flow forecasts are important for operating effective and proactive traffic management systems in the context of dynamic traffic assignment. For predicting short-term traffic flows, recent traffic information is clearly a more significant indicator of the near-future traffic flow. In other words, the relative significance depending on the time difference between traffic flow data should be considered. Although there have been several research works for short-term traffic flow predictions, they are offline methods. This paper presents a novel prediction model, called online learning weighted support-vector regression (OLWSVR), for short-term traffic flow predictions. The OLWSVR model is compared with several well-known prediction models, including artificial neural network models, locally weighted regression, conventional support-vector regression, and online learning support-vector regression. The results show that the performance of the proposed model is superior to that of existing models.

J	Cong, Z; De Schutter, B; Babuska, R				Cong, Zhe; De Schutter, Bart; Babuska, Robert			Ant Colony Routing algorithm for freeway networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Ant Colony Optimization; Model Predictive Control; Dynamic traffic routing; Stench pheromone	ASSIGNMENT; SYSTEM; MODEL	Dynamic traffic routing refers to the process of (re)directing vehicles at junctions in a traffic network according to the evolving traffic conditions. The traffic management center can determine desired routes for drivers in order to optimize the performance of the traffic network by dynamic traffic routing. However, a traffic network may have thousands of links and nodes, resulting in a large-scale and computationally complex non-linear, non-convex optimization problem. To solve this problem, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is chosen as the optimization method in this paper because of its powerful optimization heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems. ACO is implemented online to determine the control signal - i.e., the splitting rates at each node. However, using standard ACO for traffic routing is characterized by four main disadvantages: 1. traffic flows for different origins and destinations cannot be distinguished; 2. all ants may converge to one route, causing congestion; 3. constraints cannot be taken into account; and 4. neither can dynamic link costs. These problems are addressed by adopting a novel ACO algorithm with stench pheromone and with colored ants, called Ant Colony Routing (ACR). Using the stench pheromone, the ACR algorithm can distribute the vehicles over the traffic network with less or no traffic congestion, as well as reduce the number of vehicles near some sensitive zones, such as hospitals and schools. With colored ants, the traffic flows for multiple origins and destinations can be represented. The proposed approach is also implemented in a simulation-based case study in the Walcheren area, the Netherlands, illustrating the effectiveness of the approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Zahran, EMM				Zahran, E. M. M.			A Novel Approach to improve the Air Quality Predictions of Air Pollution Dispersion Modelling systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Calibration; Validation; Background concentrations; Modelling and air pollution	ALGORITHMS	The aim of this research paper is the introduction of a novel mathematical approach to improve the accuracy of the results of air pollution dispersion models based on the calibration of input background concentrations. Using the Dunkirk area of the City of Nottingham in the UK as a case study, an air pollution model in ADMS-Roads was created for developing the mathematical approach. The iterative application of this approach to the input-background concentrations effectively reduced the error between IRA Only the annual mean, but also the hourly, calculated and monitored air pollution concentrations. The traffic flow profiles of the modelled road network were included in the air pollution model and their impact on the model results, after the application of the calibration approach, was investigated. The inclusion of the traffic flow profiles reduced further the error between the hourly, but not the annual means of, calculated and monitored concentrations.

J	Xu, H; Liu, HC; Gong, HX				Xu, Hao; Liu, Hongchao; Gong, Huaxin			Modeling the asymmetry in traffic flow (a): Microscopic approach	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Asymmetric car-following; Microscopic model; Anisotropic	DYNAMICS	The asymmetric characteristic of a vehicle's ability in deceleration and acceleration, as well as its impact to micro- and macroscopic traffic flow has caused increased attention from both theoretical and practical sides. However, how to realistically model this property remains a challenge to researchers. This paper is one of the two studies on this topic, which is focused on the modeling at the microscopic level from the investigation of car-following behavior. The second part of the study [H. Liu, H. Xu, H. Gong, Modeling the asymmetry in traffic flow (b): macroscopic approach, Appl. Math. Model. (submitted for publication)] is focused on the modeling of this asymmetric property from the macroscopic scale. In this paper, we first present an asymmetric full velocity difference car-following approach, in which a higher order differential equation is developed to take into account the effect of asymmetric acceleration and deceleration in car-following. Then, efforts are dedicated to calibrate the sensitivity coefficients from field data to complete the theoretical approach. Using the data recorded from the main lane traffic and ramp traffic of a segment of the US101 freeway, the two sensitivity coefficients have been successfully calibrated from both congested and light traffic environments. The experimental study reveals that in the studied traffic flow, the intensity of positive velocity difference term is significantly higher than the negative velocity difference term, which agrees well with the results from studies on vehicle mechanics.

J	Gupta, AK; Redhu, P				Gupta, Arvind Kumar; Redhu, Poonam			Analyses of driver's anticipation effect in sensing relative flux in a new lattice model for two-lane traffic system	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Driver's anticipation effect; Two-lane system	MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; CONTINUUM MODELS; MACRO MODEL; FLOW; DIFFERENCE	In this paper, a new lattice hydrodynamic traffic flow model is proposed by considering the driver's anticipation effect in sensing relative flux (DAESRF) for two-lane system. The effect of anticipation parameter on the stability of traffic flow is examined through linear stability analysis and shown that the anticipation term can significantly enlarge the stability region on the phase diagram. To describe the phase transition of traffic flow, mKdV equation near the critical point is derived through nonlinear analysis. The theoretical findings have been verified using numerical simulation which confirms that traffic jam can be suppressed efficiently by considering the anticipation effect in the new lattice model for two-lane traffic.

Here we study long-term traffic recordings consisting of approximate to 2900 days of flow, density, and velocity time series with minute resolution from a Spanish motorway. We calculate fluctuations, cross-correlations, and long-term persistence properties of these quantities in the flow-density diagram. This leads to a data-driven definition of (local) traffic states based on the dynamical properties of the data, which differ from those given in standard guidelines. We find that detrending techniques must be used for persistence analysis because of non-stationary daily and weekly traffic flow patterns. We compare our results for the measured data with analysis results for a microscopic traffic model, finding good agreement in most quantities. However, the simulations cannot easily reproduce the congested traffic states observed in the data. We show how fluctuations and cross-correlations in traffic data may be used for prediction, i.e., as indications of increasing or decreasing velocities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Variables with respect to road conditions, time variables, and participant characteristics were studied separately at first and then jointly in a logistic multiple regression model allowing to weigh different accounts of single vehicle as opposed to multivehicle crash occurrence. The most important variables to differentiate between single and multivehicle crashes were traffic flow, the presence of a junction and the presence of a physical division between carriageways. Heavy good vehicles and motorcycles were less likely to be involved in single vehicle crashes than cars. Moreover crashes of impaired drivers with more passengers were more likely to be single vehicle crashes than those of other drivers. Young drivers, rural roads, nights and weekends were all shown to have a higher proportion of single vehicle crashes but in the multivariate analysis these effects were demonstrated to be mediated by the road conditions named above.

It is found that, as in highway traffic [Kerner, Phys. Rev. E 85, 036110 (2012)], such a jam-absorption effect in city traffic is explained by a strong driver's speed adaptation: Time headways (space gaps) between vehicles increase upstream of a moving queue (moving jam), resulting in moving queue dissolution. It turns out that at given traffic signal parameters, the stronger the speed adaptation effect, the shorter the mean distance between the signal location and the road location at which moving queues dissolve fully and oversaturated traffic consists of synchronized flow only. A comparison of the synchronized flow in city traffic found in this Brief Report with synchronized flow in highway traffic is made.

Pavement texture from high-speed laser for pavement management system	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PAVEMENT ENGINEERING			English	Article						pavement management system; skid resistance; high-speed laser; locked-wheel skid trailer; pavement texture; mean profile depth	SURFACE MACROTEXTURE	The locked-wheel skid trailer (ASTM E274) is commonly used to estimate the skid resistance of pavements in the United States. However, this method is very expensive and disturbs the traffic flows during the test. Hence, a correlation was developed between skid resistance or skid number (SN40R) values obtained using skid tester and the texture data or mean profile depth (MPD), collected using a vehicle-mounted laser operating at highway speeds from nine highway test sections. This paper describes two field tests performed to validate the above-mentioned Skid Resistance versus MPD correlation and to also develop a rapid screening methodology for skid resistance of a network of pavements. In addition to the locked-wheel skid trailer and vehicle-mounted laser, several other tests such as the Dynamic Friction Test (DFT), circular texture meter (CTM) and sand patch tests were also performed. The MPD values obtained from the vehicle-mounted laser operating at highway speeds and cumulative daily traffic volumes for each pavement were used to estimate the equivalent SN40R values. The measured and estimated SN40R values compared well with a maximum variance of less than 5. The proposed screening methodology to estimate skid numbers from measured texture data was embedded into computer code and was incorporated into the Pavement Management System for rapid screening of skid resistance.

Our key objective is to provide these models to users who, through planning with these models, can prevent events or more effectively react to them. The first of the three models is an industrial systems simulation tool that closely replicates rail passenger traffic flows between New York Penn Station and Trenton, New Jersey. Second, we built and used a line source plume model to trace chemical plumes released by a slow-moving freight train that could impact rail passengers, as well as people in surrounding areas. Third, we crafted an economic simulation model that estimates the regional economic consequences of a variety of rail-related hazard events through the year 2020. Each model can work independently of the others. However, used together they help provide a coherent story about what could happen and set the stage for planning that should make rail-centered transport systems more resistant and resilient to hazard events. We highlight the limitations and opportunities presented by using these models individually or in sequence.

J	Jin, WL				Jin, Wen-Long			Stability and bifurcation in network traffic flow: A Poincare map approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Network kinematic wave theory; Diverge-merge network; Circular information propagation; Poincare map; Stability; Bifurcation		Previous studies have shown that, in a diverge-merge network with two intermediate links (the DM network), the kinematic wave model always admits stationary solutions under constant boundary conditions, but periodic oscillations can develop from empty initial conditions. Such contradictory observations suggest that the stationary states be unstable. In this study we develop a systematic approach to investigate the stability property of stationary states in this and other networks within the framework of network kinematic wave theories. Based on the observation that kinematic waves propagate in a circular path when only one of the two intermediate links is congested, we derive a one-dimensional, discrete Poincare map in the out-flux at a Poincare section. We then prove that the fixed points of the Poincare map correspond to stationary flow-rates on the two links. With Lyapunov's first method, we demonstrate that the Poincare map can be finite-time stable, asymptotically stable, or unstable. When unstable, the map is found to have periodical points of period two, but no chaotic solutions. We further analyze the bifurcation in the stability of the Poincare map caused by varying route choice proportions. We apply the Poincare map approach to analyzing traffic patterns in more general (DM)(n) and beltway networks, which are sufficient and necessary structures for network-induced unstable traffic and gridlock, respectively. This study demonstrates that the Poincare map approach can be efficiently applied to analyze traffic dynamics in any road networks with circular information propagation and provides new insights into unstable traffic dynamics caused by interactions among network bottlenecks.

J	Zheng, N; Geroliminis, N				Zheng, Nan; Geroliminis, Nikolas			On the distribution of urban road space for multimodal congested networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Space allocation; Multi-modal; Macroscopic fundamental diagram; Optimization; Traffic flow; Public transport	OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES; MODEL; VARIABILITY; CAPACITY; SYSTEMS	Transport systems in real cities are complex with many modes of transport sharing and competing for limited road space. This work intends to understand how space distributions for modes and interactions among modes affect network traffic performance. While the connection between performance of transport systems and general land allocation is the subject of extensive research, space allocation for interacting modes of transport is an open research question. Quantifying the impact of road space distribution on the performance of a congested multimodal transport system with a dynamic aggregated model remains a challenge. In this paper, a multimodal macroscopic fundamental diagram (MFD) is developed to represent the traffic dynamics of a multimodal transport system. Optimization is performed with the objective of minimizing the total passenger hours traveled (PHT) to serve the total demand by redistributing road space among modes. Pricing strategies are also investigated to provide a higher demand shift to more efficient modes. We find by an application to a bi-modal two-region city that (i) the proposed model captures the operational characteristics of each mode, and (ii) optimal dynamic space distribution strategies can be developed. In practice, the approach can serve as a physical dynamic model to inform space distribution strategies for policy makers with different goals of mobility. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In our previous studies (Jin, 2010a,b), a phenomenological model of lane-changing traffic flow was proposed, calibrated, and analyzed based on a new concept of lane-changing intensity. In this study, we further consider weaving and non-weaving vehicles as two commodities and develop a multi-commodity, behavioral Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) model of lane-changing traffic flow. Based on a macroscopic model of lane-changing behaviors, we derive a fundamental diagram with parameters determined by car-following and lane-changing characteristics as well as road geometry and traffic composition. We further calibrate and validate fundamental diagrams corresponding to a triangular car-following fundamental diagram with NGSIM data. We introduce an entropy condition for the multi-commodity LWR model and solve the Riemann problem inside a homogeneous lane-changing area. From the Riemann solutions, we derive a flux function in terms of traffic demand and supply. Then we apply the model to study lane-changing traffic dynamics inside a lane-drop area and show that the smoothing effect of HOV lanes is consistent with observations in existing studies. The new theory of lane-changing traffic flow can be readily incorporated into Cell Transmission Model, and this study could lead to better strategies for mitigating bottleneck effects of lane-changing traffic flow.

Marginal costs of freeway traffic congestion with on-road pollution exposure externality	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						External costs; Traffic congestion; On-road; In-vehicle; Pollution exposure; Vehicle emissions	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; FUEL CONSUMPTION; ENVIRONMENTAL EXTERNALITIES; URBAN TRANSPORT; HEALTH-BENEFITS; UNITED-STATES; VEHICLE USE; MORTALITY; EMISSIONS; CAPACITY	The health cost of on-road air pollution exposure is a component of traffic marginal costs that has not previously been assessed. The main objective of this paper is to introduce on-road pollution exposure as an externality of traffic, particularly important during traffic congestion when on-road pollution exposure is highest. Marginal private and external cost equations are developed that include on-road pollution exposure in addition to time, fuel, and pollution emissions components. The marginal external cost of on-road exposure includes terms for the marginal vehicle's emissions, the increased emissions from all vehicles caused by additional congestion from the marginal vehicle, and the additional exposure duration for all travelers caused by additional congestion from the marginal vehicle. A sensitivity analysis shows that on-road pollution exposure can be a large portion (18%) of marginal social costs of traffic flow near freeway capacity, ranging from 4% to 38% with different exposure parameters. In an optimal pricing scenario, excluding the on-road exposure externality can lead to 6% residual welfare loss because of sub-optimal tolls. While regional pollution generates greater costs in uncongested conditions, on-road exposure comes to dominate health costs on congested freeways because of increased duration and intensity of exposure. The estimated marginal cost and benefit curves indicate a theoretical preference for price controls to address the externality problem. The inclusion of on-road exposure costs reduces the magnitudes of projects required to cover implementation costs for intelligent transportation system (ITS) improvements; the net benefits of road-pricing ITS systems are increased more than the net benefits of ITS traffic flow improvements. When considering distinct vehicle classes, inclusion of on-road exposure costs greatly increases heavy-duty vehicle marginal costs because of their higher emissions rates and greater roadway capacity utilization. Lastly, there are large uncertainties associated with the parameters utilized in the estimation of health outcomes that are a function of travel pollution intensity and duration. More research is needed to develop on-road exposure modeling tools that link repeated short-duration exposure and health outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fowe, AJ; Chan, YP				Fowe, Adeyemi J.; Chan, Yupo			A microstate spatial-inference model for network-traffic estimation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Spatial inference; Traffic estimation; Entropy maximization; Golden-section search	SENSOR LOCATIONS	In an Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS), sensors are often used to monitor and obtain traffic information on a real-time basis. Knowing that traffic sensors cover only a fraction of the road network, we investigate how to estimate traffic volumes on arcs that are not covered by sensors. By exploiting the spatial properties and the topology of a network, we derive a microstate model that can be used to estimate these traffic volumes. Based on entropy maximization, we present a microstate surrogate for competing techniques such as traffic assignment, and algebraic method or topological approach in estimating traffic flow. Being an entropy model, it also has advantage over these competing techniques in terms of the prerequisite information required to enable the model. Being a microstate rather than a steady-state model, it takes into account the fluctuation of traffic and it executes fast enough to allow real-time estimation of traffic flow. By covering the entire network flow this way with only a limited number of sensors, it will help in better driver routing decisions and traffic management tactics while being cognizant of today's budgetary constraints facing operating agencies. The algorithm has been tested successfully in Little Rock, Arkansas and in a controlled experiment with a randomly generated 100-node/522-arc grid network.

We establish the driver model by regarding each vehicle as an intelligent agent which constitutes the multi-agent system by integrating the cellular automation model at the traffic circle. Besides, we put forward the problem how to eliminate the conflicts between the vehicle agents by priority strategy and dynamic negotiation mechanism. Take the traffic flow at the classic traffic circle of the suburban area of a small-medium city as the sample data to simulate and verify the accuracy of the model, and study the influences of some factors on the flow of motor vehicle, such as the proportion of different driver type and track changing probability, etc. The experimental result shows that the model constructed is consistent with the actual situation. Meanwhile, it is found that the driver characteristics have obvious influences on the flow, and the track changing probability follows, which does not have obvious influences on the fluctuation in the flow.

J	Li, CS; Chen, MC				Li, Chi-Sen; Chen, Mu-Chen			Identifying important variables for predicting travel time of freeway with non-recurrent congestion with neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Travel time prediction; Freeway; Electronic toll collection; Non-recurrent congestion; Neural networks	SHORT-TERM PREDICTION; REAL-TIME; TRAFFIC PREDICTION; IDENTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; BUSINESS; MODELS; SYSTEM	The provision of long-distance travel time information has been a major factor facilitating the intelligent transportation system to become more successful. Previous studies have pointed out that non-recurrent congestion is the major cause of freeway delay. The long travel distance complicates the characteristics of traffic flow. Hence, how to improve the prediction capability of long-distance travel time in the case of non-recurrent congestion is an important issue that must be overcome in the field of travel time prediction. This study constructs the travel time prediction model for a segment of 36.1 kms (including eight interchanges) in the National Freeway No. 1, Taiwan, by using the multilayer perceptron. To improve the prediction capability of the model in the case of non-recurrent congestion, this study collects data of average spot speed and heavy vehicle volume gathered by dual-loop vehicle detectors, in addition to rainfall and temporal feature. Furthermore, the historical travel time inferred from the original data of electronic toll collection (ETC) system is also used as the input variable, and the actual travel time inferred from ETC is used as the training target to establish a robust prediction model. As suggested by the results of 168 experimental combinations, the most appropriate prediction model established in this study is a highly accurate forecasting model with MAPE of 6.47 %.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Yang, C				Zhu, Zuojin; Yang, Chun			Visco-elastic traffic flow model	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						visco-elastic traffic model; congested traffic flows; traffic relaxation time; traffic sound speed	PHYSICS; WAVES; PHASE	To increase our understanding of the operations of traffic system, a visco-elastic traffic model was proposed in analogy of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. The traffic model is based on mass and momentum conservations, and includes a constitutive relation similar to that of linear visco-elastic fluids. The further inclusion of the elastic effect allows us to describe a high-order traffic model more comprehensively because the use of relaxation time indicates that vehicle drivers adjust their time headway in a reasonable and safe range. The self-organizing behaviour is described by introducing the effects of pressure and visco-elasticity from the point of view in fluid mechanics. Both the viscosity and elasticity can be determined by using the relaxation time and the traffic sound speed. The sound speed can be approximately represented by the road operational parameters including the free-flow speed, the jam density, and the density of saturation if the jam pressure in traffic flows is identical to the total pressure at the flow saturation point. A linear stability analysis showed that the traffic flow should be absolutely unstable for disturbances with short spatial wavelengths. There are two critical points of regime transition in traffic flows. The first point happens at the density of saturation, and the second point occurs at a density relating on the sound speed and the fundamental diagram of traffic flows. By using a triangular form flow-density relation, a numerical test based on the new model is carried out for congested traffic flows on a loop road without ramp effect. The numerical results are discussed and compared with the result of theoretical analysis and observation data of traffic flows. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The proposed method combines the DLM model with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the probability of flow breakdown and delays associated with congestion. By viewing travel time fluctuations as a time-varying stochastic process due to unforeseen events (e.g.,incidents, accidents, or bad weather), the proposed dynamic linear model with Markov switching (SDLM) employs the HMM to determine the optimal traffic state sequence corresponding to a given travel time and flow rate observation sequence. The experimental results based on automatic license plate recognition data of a Jingtong Expressway stretch in Beijing City suggest that the proposed method can provide accurate and reliable travel time prediction under various traffic conditions.

J	Dhamaniya, A; Chandra, S				Dhamaniya, Ashish; Chandra, Satish			Concept of Stream Equivalency Factor for Heterogeneous Traffic on Urban Arterial Roads	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						Speed; Mixed traffic; Urban arterial; Equivalency factor; Simulation	PASSENGER CAR EQUIVALENTS; CAPACITY; UNITS	Mixed traffic flow is often converted to equivalent flow in passenger car units (PCUs) by multiplying the number of each category of vehicles in the traffic stream by their respective PCU factors and then adding them up. PCU is a complex parameter and depends on multitude of factors. This paper presents a methodology to convert a mixed traffic stream into a homogeneous equivalent without making use of PCU factors. Traffic volume and speed data collected on different six-lane urban arterial roads in India are analyzed to determine PCU values of five different categories of vehicles found on these roads. These PCU values are used to convert heterogeneous traffic volume in vehicles per hour to homogeneous volume in PCU per hour. A new term stream equivalency factor (SEF) is introduced in this study and denoted by K. It is the ratio of traffic volume in PCU per hour and volume in vehicles per hour. The K factor is related to traffic composition and volume on a road through the regression analysis method. A microsimulation program is used to generate the traffic flow data for two, three, four, and five categories of vehicles in the traffic stream, and these data were utilized to present a generalized solution for determining the value of K for any combination of traffic composition and volume on a road. The proposed method is simple to use and expected to eliminate the problem of estimation of PCU factors required in many studies.

In such cases, a traffic separation scheme (TSS) can be established to guide the ship traffic. This paper is based on work performed in connection with a proposed bridge across Fehmarnbelt between Denmark and Germany, and the purpose is to estimate the efficiency of a TSS guiding traffic through the main bridge openings. The efficiency in terms of getting the traffic through the traffic lanes without the TSS hindering traffic flow is an important decision parameter in the bridge design process.

This is due to the unique geometric feature of CFI, which comprises one primary intersection and several crossover intersections. The interdependent relationship between traffic delays and queues at a CFI with five closely spaced intersections cannot be fully captured with the existing analysis models, which were developed primarily for conventional intersections. In response to such a need, this study presents a comprehensive analysis for the overall CFI delay, identifies the potential queue spillback locations, and develops a set of planning-stage models for the CFI design geometry. To facilitate the application of these proposed models, this paper also includes a case study of a CFI at the intersection of MD 4 and MD 235 constructed by the Maryland State Highway Administration.

Using data obtained from a 22-mile freeway segment on the I-880N freeway in San Francisco Bay Area in the United States, Fisher discriminant analysis was conducted to derive a linear combination of traffic flow parameters which can be used to distinguish traffic states which may lead to crashes from normal traffic conditions which were potentially safe. A new variable termed "crash risk index" was defined based on the discriminant function. A crash risk index which is smaller than 0 represents a hazardous traffic condition potentially leading to a crash. Accordingly, a crash risk index which is greater than 0 represents normal traffic conditions which, theoretically, will not lead to crash occurrences. The research team tested the prediction performance of using the crash risk index to identify hazardous traffic conditions on freeway mainlines. An overall prediction accuracy of about 65.7% was achieved. Conditional logistic regression analysis was then conducted to evaluate the impacts of crash risk indexes on the likelihood of crash occurrences. It was found that the likelihood of freeway crashes increased with the decreases in crash risk index. One unit decrease in crash risk index increased the risk of crash occurrence by 180.3%. The research team also looked extensively at the impacts of crash risk indexes at different time slices. It was found that the impacts of crash risk index decrease with time and the crash risk index at the time slice most immediately before crashes had the greatest impact on crash occurrences.

Criticism of generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of traffic and transportation theory: A brief review	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Review						Highway capacity; Lighthill-Whitham-Richards theory; General Motors class of traffic flow models; Wardrop' UE and SO principles; Three-phase traffic theory; Breakdown minimization principle	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DYNAMIC USER EQUILIBRIUM; NETWORK DESIGN PROBLEM; CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES; SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; PHASE-DIAGRAM; ON-RAMP; TRAVEL-TIME	It is explained why the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown (a transition from free flow to congested traffic) should be the empirical basis for any traffic and transportation theory that can be reliably used for control and optimization in traffic networks. It is shown that the generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory are not consistent with the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck. To these fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory belong (i) Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) theory, (ii) the General Motors (GM) model class (for example, Herman, Gazis et al. GM model, Gipps's model, Payne's model, Newell's optimal velocity (OV) model, Wiedemann's model, Bando et al. OV model, Treiber's IDM, Krauss's model), (iii) the understanding of highway capacity as a particular (fixed or stochastic) value, and (iv) principles for traffic and transportation network optimization and control (for example, Wardrop's user equilibrium (UE) and system optimum (SO) principles). Alternatively to these generally accepted fundamentals and methodologies of the traffic and transportation theory, we discuss the three-phase traffic theory as the basis for traffic flow modeling as well as briefly consider the network breakdown minimization (BM) principle for the optimization of traffic and transportation networks with road bottlenecks.

To describe the synchronized flow phase of Kerner's three-phase theory in accordance with empirical data, we have changed some rules of vehicle motion with the aim to improve speed and acceleration vehicle behavior in synchronized flow simulated with earlier cellular automaton models with brake lights. The fundamental diagrams and spatial temporal diagrams are analyzed, as well as the complexity of the traffic evolution, the emergence process of wide moving jam. Simulation results show that our new model can reproduce the three traffic phases: free flow, synchronized flow and wide moving jam. In addition, our new model can well describe the complexity of traffic evolution: (1) with initial homogeneous distribution and large densities, the traffic will evolve into multiple steady states, in which the numbers of wide moving jams are not invariable. (2) With initial homogeneous distribution and the middle range of density, the wide moving jam will emerge stochastically. (3) With initial mega-jam distribution and the density close to a point with the low value, the initial mega-jam will disappear stochastically. (4) For the cases with multiple wide moving jams, the process is analyzed involving the generation of narrow moving jam due to "pinch effect", which leads to wide moving jam emergence.

J	Li, L; Quddus, M; Zhao, L				Li, Liang; Quddus, Mohammed; Zhao, Lin			High accuracy tightly-coupled integrity monitoring algorithm for map-matching	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Land vehicle navigation; Map-matching; Integrity; RAIM; Extended Kalman filter	PERFORMANCE; GPS	A map-matching algorithm employs data from Global Positioning System (GPS), a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based road map and other sensors to first identify the correct link on which a vehicle travels and then to determine the physical location of the vehicle on the link. Due to uncertainties associated with the raw measurements from GPS/other sensors, the road map and the related methods, it is essential to monitor the integrity of map-matching results, especially for safety and mission-critical intelligent transport systems such as positioning and navigation of autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles. Current integrity methods for map-matching are inadequate and unreliable as they fail to satisfy the integrity requirement due mainly to incorrect treatment of all the related uncertainties simultaneously. The aim of this paper is therefore to develop a new tightly-coupled integrity monitoring method for map-matching by properly treating the uncertainties from all sources concurrently. In this method, the raw measurements from GPS, low-cost Dead-Reckoning (DR) sensors and Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are first integrated using an extended Kalman Filter to continuously obtain better position fixes. A weight-based topological map-matching process is then developed to map-match position fixes onto the road map. The accuracy of the map-matching process is enhanced by employing a range of network features such as grade separation, traffic flow directions and the geometry of road link. The Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM) technique, which has been successfully applied to monitor the integrity of aircraft navigation, is modified and enhanced so as to apply it to monitor the quality of map-matching. In the enhanced RAIM method, two modifications are made: (1) a variable false alarm rate (as opposed to a constant false alarm rate) is considered to improve the fault detection performance in selecting the links, especially near junctions. (2) a sigma inflation for a non-Gaussian distribution of measurement noises is applied for the purpose of satisfying the integrity risk requirement. The implementation and validation of the enhanced RAIM method is accomplished by utilising the required navigation performance parameters (in terms of accuracy, integrity and availability) of safety and mission-critical intelligent transport systems. The required data were collected from Nottingham and central London. In terms of map-matching, the results suggest that the developed map-matching method is capable of identifying at least 97.7% of the links correctly in the case of frequent GPS outages. In terms of integrity, the enhanced RAIM method provides better the fault detection performance relative to the traditional RAIM.

Existing techniques can reveal where/when congested areas are formed, developed, and moved on one or several highway roads, but it is still challenging to visualise the evolution of traffic congestion on the whole road network, especially on dense urban networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three 3D exploratory visualisation techniques: the isosurface, the constrained isosurface, and the wall map. These three techniques have different advantages and should be combined to leverage their respective strong points. We present our visualisation techniques with the case of link travel time data from Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) in London.

The primary objectives are to characterize gridlock and understand its dynamics. This study addresses a gap in the literature with regard to the existence of exit flow and recovery period. The one-dimensional theoretical Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) only represents steady-state behavior and holds only when the inputs change slowly in time and traffic is distributed homogenously in space. Also, it does not describe the hysteretic behavior of the network traffic when a gridlock forms or when network recovers. Thus, a model is proposed to reproduce hysteresis and gridlock when homogeneity and steady-state conditions do not hold. It is conjectured that the network average flow can be approximated as a non-linear function of network average density and variation in link densities. The proposed model is calibrated for the Chicago Central Business District (CBD) network. We also show that complex urban networks with multiple route choices, similar to the idealized network tested previously in the literature, tend to jam at a range of densities that are smaller than the theoretical average network jam density. Also it is demonstrated that networks tend to gridlock in many different ways with different configurations. This study examines how mobility of urban street networks could be improved by managing vehicle accumulation and redistributing network traffic via strategies such as demand management and disseminating real-time traveler information (adaptive driving). This study thus defines and explores some key characteristics and dynamics of urban street network gridlocks including gridlock formation, propagation, recovery, size, etc. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Peng, GH				Peng Guang-Han			A New Lattice Model of Two-Lane Traffic Flow with the Consideration of the Honk Effect	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						traffic flow; lattice model; honk effect; wide moving jam	OPTIMAL CURRENT DIFFERENCE; MODIFIED KDV EQUATION; JAMMING TRANSITION; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; PEDESTRIAN FLOW	In this paper, a new lattice model of two-lane traffic flow with the honk effect term is proposed to study the influence of the honk effect on wide moving jams under lane changing. The linear stability condition on two-lane highway is obtained by applying the linear stability theory. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation near the critical point is derived and the coexisting curves resulted from the modified KdV equation can be described, which shows that the critical point, the coexisting curve and the neutral stability line decrease with increasing the honk effect coefficient. A wide moving jam can be conceivably described approximately in the unstable region. Numerical simulation is performed to verify the analytic results. The results show that the honk effect could suppress effectively the congested traffic patterns about wide moving jam propagation in lattice model of two-lane traffic flow.

The emission model was derived based on Bando's optimal velocity model with a consideration of slope. Simulations were conducted to examine the relationship between the CO2 emission rate of vehicles and slope of road, traffic density, and road length. Analysis of the results shows that some original laws of CO2 emission in traffic flow with congestion were exhibited. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lv, W; Song, WG; Fang, ZM; Ma, J				Lv, Wei; Song, Wei-guo; Fang, Zhi-ming; Ma, Jian			Modelling of lane-changing behaviour integrating with merging effect before a city road bottleneck	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Lane-changing; Merging effect; Merging distance; Merging probability; Bottleneck	TRAFFIC-FLOW MODEL; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; SIMULATIONS; TRANSITION; STATES; RULES	Merging behaviour is a compulsive action in a discretionary lane-changing traffic system, especially in a system with a bottleneck. This paper aims to investigate the generic lane-changing behaviour considering the merging effect before a city road bottleneck. Thus firstly the merging behaviour is distinguished from other generic lane-changing behaviour. Combining discretionary lane-changing and compulsive merging, we developed an integrative traffic model, in which a method to calculate the lane-changing probability and the merging probability was proposed. A simulation scenario derived from real life was conducted to validate the proposed programming algorithm. Finally, a discussion on the simulation findings shows that the merging influence can be expanded and the merging behaviour can increase the probability of local traffic jamming in its affected area of the adjacent lane. The distribution of the merging distance provides fundamental insights for actual traffic management. The result of the clearance time implies the position of the incident point has a significant effect on the clearing time and it is important to ensure the end (exit) of the road is unimpeded in traffic evacuation.

Two simple feedback controllers for local MTFC via VSL are proposed. Both controllers are evaluated and compared to a previously developed local MTFC feedback cascade controller and to a sophisticated optimal control approach. All feedback controllers rely on readily available real-time measurements, are simple and robust, and take into account a number of practical and safety restrictions; therefore, they are suitable for implementation in the field as a new or as part of an existing intelligent transportation systems infrastructure. The evaluations are conducted for a hypothetical freeway network by use of a validated second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The results show that the feedback controllers exhibit a satisfactory control behavior and, indeed, approach the optimal control results. Recommendations for the operation of the feedback controllers are given.

J	Bulan, O; Bernal, EA; Loce, RP				Bulan, Orhan; Bernal, Edgar A.; Loce, Robert P.			Efficient processing of transportation surveillance videos in the compressed domain	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article							SPEED; VEHICLES; MODEL	Video surveillance is used extensively in intelligent transportation systems to enforce laws, collect tolls, and regularize traffic flow. Benefits to society include reduced fuel consumption and emissions, improved safety, and reduced traffic congestion. These video cameras installed at traffic lights, highways, toll booths, etc., continuously capture video and hence generate a vast amount of data that are stored in large databases. The captured video is typically compressed before being transmitted and/or stored. While all the archived information is present in the compressed video, most current applications operate on uncompressed video. The aim is to improve the efficiency of processing by utilizing features of the compression process and the compressed video stream. Key methods that are employed involve intelligent selection of reference frames (I-frames) and exploitation of the compression motion vectors. Although specific applications in the transportation imaging domain are presented, the methods proposed here can generally impact the ability to mine vast amounts of video data for usable information in many diverse settings. Applications presented include rapid search for target vehicles (Amber Alert, Silver Alert, stolen car, etc.), vehicle counting, stop sign/light enforcement, and vehicle speed estimation.

Modeling vehicle operating speed on urban roads in Montreal: A panel mixed ordered probit fractional split model	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						Fractional split models; Mixed ordered response fractional split models; Vehicle operating speed; Montreal	2-LANE; DESIGN	Vehicle operating speed measured on roadways is a critical component for a host of analysis in the transportation field including transportation safety, traffic flow modeling, roadway geometric design, vehicle emissions modeling, and road user route decisions. The current research effort contributes to the literature on examining vehicle speed on urban roads methodologically and substantively. In terms of methodology, we formulate a new econometric model framework for examining speed profiles. The proposed model is an ordered response formulation of a fractional split model. The ordered nature of the speed variable allows us to propose an ordered variant of the fractional split model in the literature. The proposed formulation allows us to model the proportion of vehicles traveling in each speed interval for the entire segment of roadway. We extend the model to allow the influence of exogenous variables to vary across the population. Further, we develop a panel mixed version of the fractional split model to account for the influence of site-specific unobserved effects. The paper contributes substantively by estimating the proposed model using a unique dataset from Montreal consisting of weekly speed data (collected in hourly intervals) for about 50 local roads and 70 arterial roads. We estimate separate models for local roads and arterial roads. The model estimation exercise considers a whole host of variables including geometric design attributes, roadway attributes, traffic characteristics and environmental factors. The model results highlight the role of various street characteristics including number of lanes, presence of parking, presence of sidewalks, vertical grade, and bicycle route on vehicle speed proportions. The results also highlight the presence of site-specific unobserved effects influencing the speed distribution. The parameters from the modeling exercise are validated using a hold-out sample not considered for model estimation. The results indicate that the proposed panel mixed ordered probit fractional split model offers promise for modeling such proportional ordinal variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fang, Y; Chen, JZ; Peng, ZY				Fang Yuan; Chen Jian-Zhong; Peng Zhi-Yuan			The effect of moving bottlenecks on a two-lane traffic flow	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						traffic flow; moving bottleneck; lane changing; coupling effect	MODEL; TRANSITION; WAVE	In this paper, we study the effect of moving bottlenecks on traffic flow. The full velocity difference (FVD) model is extended to the traffic flow on a two-lane highway, and new lane changing rule is proposed to reproduce the vehicular lane changing behavior. Using this model, we derive the fundamental current-density diagrams for the traffic flow with the effect of moving bottleneck. Moreover, typical time-space diagram for a two-lane highway shows the formation and dissipation of a moving bottleneck. Results demonstrate that the effect of moving bottleneck enlarges with the increase of traffic density, but the effect can be reduced by increasing the maximum velocity of heavy truck. The effects of multiple moving bottlenecks under different conditions are investigated. The effect becomes more remarkable when the coupling effect of multiple moving bottlenecks occurs.

J	Sofer, T; Polus, A; Bekhor, S				Sofer, Tal; Polus, Abishai; Bekhor, Shlomo			A congestion-dependent, Dynamic Flexibility Model of freeway networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Congestion; Flexibility; Highway network	CAPACITY; ROBUSTNESS; LINKS	The concept of flexibility is very common in many engineering aspects but less common in transportation planning. This study develops a dynamic model of system flexibility for freeway networks. When comparing different freeway networks, it is essential to have a measure defining a network's flexibility based not only on its topology but also on the amount of traffic compared to each segment's capacity. Application of the proposed flexibility model could be helpful in estimating the perceived amount of total system congestion in a given network at any given time and how this congestion may vary if a new link is added to the system. The proposed Dynamic Flexibility Model is based on three variables: the number of routes between each origin-destination (O-D) pair in the freeway network, the amount of length in common in each O-D pair, and the amount of variability among the various routes in each O-D pair relative to the shortest path in the same O-D. The traffic flow is included in the model via the perceived length: the relevant length is equal to its actual length in an uncongested state and increases during periods of congestion, since drivers then experience longer travel times, which are converted into an equivalent increase in the perceived-segment length. In this work, the onset of congestion that was adapted was at the Critical Occupancy Point (COP), which is an objective measure evaluating whether or not a freeway segment is congested. This paper shows that the proposed Dynamic Flexibility Model is able to compare different freeway networks, thus adding a new dimension for measuring drivers' flexibility in choosing other routes in case some links suffer congestion and breakdown. Furthermore, the proposed model helps to define the perceived total congestion in the system. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Dixit, VV				Dixit, Vinayak V.			Behavioural foundations of two-fluid model for urban traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Two-fluid model; Utility maximization; Driver behaviour	DRIVER BEHAVIOR; ARTERIAL STREETS; FLOW; OSCILLATIONS; QUALITY; SAFETY; TIME	Traditionally traffic flow models have been based on analogous physical phenomena. Though these models have been successful in representing traffic flow, there is a need to provide a systematic behavioural explanation for their existence. One such model is the two-fluid model which is analogous to the principles of Bose-Einstein condensation of particles at low temperatures. The model has been extensively used to characterize the quality of traffic on urban networks and arterial streets. The two parameters of the model essentially represent 'free flow' travel time and level of interaction among vehicles. Though the studies have found the parameters of the two-fluid model to be significantly correlated with driver behaviour (aggressive/conservative) and crash rates, no systematic behavioural explanation has been found. This paper proposes a behavioural framework based on individual trade-off behaviour to explain the two-fluid model phenomenon. The two-fluid model is derived based on a driver's attempt to maximize his quality of travel, by travelling fast while maintaining safety. Contrary to earlier assumptions the proposed framework shows the two parameters to be correlated. The theoretical framework was tested using two-fluid model data from various cities. The data was also used to estimate the effects of geometric factors on the perception of likelihood of a crash and the severity of the crash that affect the two-fluid model. Increase in the fraction of one-way streets was found to reduce the driver's perception of likelihood to crash. While reduction in the fraction of one way streets and increase in average number of lanes per street, signal density and fraction of actuated signals increased the perceived level of severity of a crash.

However, outdoor illuminations, the cast shadows and vehicle variations often create problems for video analysis and processing. Thus, the authors propose a real-time cost-effective traffic monitoring system that can reliably perform traffic flow estimation and vehicle classification at the same time. First, the foreground is extracted using a pixel-wise weighting list that models the dynamic background. Shadows are discriminated utilising colour and edge invariants. Second, the foreground on a specified check-line is then collected over time to form a spatial-temporal profile image. Third, the traffic flow is estimated by counting the number of connected components in the profile image. Finally, the vehicle type is classified according to the size of the foreground mask region. In addition, several traffic measures, including traffic velocity, flow, occupancy and density, are estimated based on the analysis of the segmentation. The availability and reliability of these traffic measures provides critical information for public transportation monitoring and intelligent traffic control. Since the proposed method only process a small area close to the check-line to collect the spatial-temporal profile for analysis, the complete system is much more efficient than existing visual traffic flow estimation methods.			mtyang@mail.ndhu.edu.tw		Yang, Mau-Tsuen/0000-0003-1859-6730	National Science Council, TaiwanMinistry of Science and Technology, Taiwan	This research was supported by the National Science Council, Taiwan.

J	Li, Y; Chen, KM; Guo, XC				Li Yan; Chen Kuan-min; Guo Xiu-cheng			Impact of stretching-segment on saturated flow rate of signalized intersection using cellular automation	JOURNAL OF CENTRAL SOUTH UNIVERSITY			English	Article						traffic engineering; saturated flow rate; stretching-segment; cellular automation model	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; CAPACITY; FREEWAY	In order to analyze the impact of stretching-segment on the saturated flow rate of signalized intersection approach, an improved cellular automation model was proposed to estimate its saturated flow rate. The NaSch model was improved by adding different slow probabilities, turning deceleration rules and modified lane changing rules. The relationship between the saturated flow rate of stretching-segments and adjacent lanes was tested in numerical simulation. The length of stretching-segment, cycle length and green time were selected as impact factors of the cellular automation model. The simulation result indicates that the geometrics design of stretching-segment and the traffic signal timing scenario have major effects on the saturated flow rate of the intersection approach. The saturated flow rate will continually increase with increasing stretching-segment length until it reaches a threshold. After reaching the threshold, the stretching-segment can be treated as a separate lane. The green time is approximately linearly related to the threshold length of the stretching-segment. An optimum cycle length exists when the length of the stretching-segment is not long enough, and it is approximately linearly related to the length of stretching-segment.

(Jiang, Y.Q., Wong, S.C., Ho, H.W., Zhang, P., Liu, RX., Sumalee, A., 2011. A dynamic traffic assignment model for a continuum transportation system. Transportation Research Part B 45 (2), 343-363) proposed a predictive continuum dynamic user-optimaDUO-1 to investigate the dynamic characteristics of traffic flow and the corresponding route-choice behavior of travelers. Their modeled region is a dense urban city that is arbitrary in shape and has a single central business district (CBD). However, we argue that the model is not well posed due to an inconsistency in the route-choice strategy under certain conditions. To overcome this inconsistency, we revisit the PDUO-C problem, and construct an improved path-choice strategy. The improved model consists of a conservation law to govern the density, in which the flow direction is determined by the improved path-choice strategy, and a Hamilton-Jacobi equation to compute the total travel cost. The simultaneous satisfaction of both equations can be treated as a fixed-point problem. A self-adaptive method of successive averages (MSA) is proposed to solve this fixed-point problem. This method can automatically determine the optimal MSA step size using the least squares approach. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and the solution algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Xu, TD; Hao, Y; Peng, ZR; Sun, LJ				Xu, Tian-dong; Hao, Yuan; Peng, Zhong-ren; Sun, Li-jun			Modeling probabilistic traffic breakdown on congested freeway flow	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic breakdown; stochastic nature; time headway; driving behavior; car-following theory	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY	The study aims to develop a novel evolution model of speed perturbations for quantifying the probability of the traffic flow breakdown on congested freeway flow. The model is applicable to freeway operation and management. Time headway, driver behavior, and state transitions with stochastic nature are the most important factors for the breakdown and recovery of a disturbance. Two types of drivers, "adventurers" and "conservatives," and two styles of reacting behavior, "copy" and "shift" are defined to characterize driving behavior. The time headway distributions for arriving and discharging traffic are distinguished for the existence of the "hysteresis" phenomenon. The Monte Carlo simulation is carried out to obtain the estimation of the probability of breakdown (PB). The calculated PB is a monotonically increasing function of freeway flow with an "S" shape. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model can describe the changes in spatial extent and magnitude of a disturbance, which have potential use for future works and field applications.

We discuss the motivation and the derivation of such a model, and we present its mathematical properties. The results are presented by means of examples where a section of a crowded one-way highway contains in the middle a cluster of drivers whose dynamics are prone to road traffic accidents. We discuss the coupling conditions and present some existence results of weak solutions to the associated Riemann Problems.

Characterization of gaseous pollutants and PM2.5 at fixed roadsides and along vehicle traveling routes in Bangkok Metropolitan Region	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						BTEX; PM2.5; On-route; Roadside; Bangkok; Pathumthani	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; EMISSIONS	Traffic is a major source of air pollution in urban areas of developing countries that leads to high exposure risk of urban dwellers. This study comparatively investigated levels of fine particles (PM2.5), SO2, NO2, and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes) at fixed roadsides and on traveling routes in congested urban and less congested suburban areas of Bangkok in 2010. The roadside air quality monitoring was done at two opposite sites across the selected roads. The traffic counting was made simultaneously in these roads and hourly flows of 8 different vehicle types were determined. Roadside PM2.5 levels during dry season were high in both the city center and suburban area, significantly above the wet season, with 65-75% measurements exceeded 24 h Thailand ambient air quality standard of 50 mu g m(-3). Oppositely, roadside BTEX levels measured in the city center during wet season were higher than dry season and well above those in suburban area. Diurnal variations and the results of SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences) analysis showed associations between roadside pollutants levels and hourly traffic flows. The differences in pollution levels between 2 monitoring sites across a road were explained by road configurations and prevalent wind directions. On-route pollution levels were measured simultaneously both inside and outside selected vehicles (van, pickup), and on motorcycle. The on-route PM2.5 levels along the urban route were higher during the dry season than wet season. PM2.5 levels inside the vehicles were lower than outside whereas the opposite was observed for BTEX. BTEX were higher on more congested urban sub-routes with lower vehicle speeds. Higher pollution levels suggest a high risk of exposure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Oanh, N. T.

J	Chan, KY; Dillon, TS; Chang, E				Chan, Kit Yan; Dillon, Tharam S.; Chang, Elizabeth			An Intelligent Particle Swarm Optimization for Short-Term Traffic Flow Forecasting Using on-Road Sensor Systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Fuzzy inference system; neural networks (NNs); particle swarm optimization (PSO); sensor data; sensor systems; time-varying systems; traffic contingency; traffic flow forecasting	NEURAL-NETWORKS; PREDICTIVE CONTROL; FUZZY; IDENTIFICATION; TEMPERATURE; MODELS; SVR	On-road sensor systems installed on freeways are used to capture traffic flow data for short-term traffic flow predictors for traffic management, to reduce traffic congestion and improve vehicular mobility. This paper intends to tackle the impractical time-invariant assumptions which underlie the methods currently used to develop short-term traffic flow predictors: 1) the characteristics of current data captured by on-road sensors are assumed to be time invariant with respect to those of the historical data, which is used to developed short-term traffic flow predictors; and 2) the configuration of the on-road sensor systems is assumed to be time-invariant. In fact, both assumptions are impractical in the real world, as the current traffic flow characteristics can be very different from the historical ones, and also the on-road sensor systems are time varying in nature due to damaged sensors or component wear. Therefore, misleading forecasting results are likely to be produced when short-term traffic flow predictors are designed using these two time-invariant assumptions. To tackle these time-invariant assumptions, an intelligent particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm is proposed to develop short-term traffic flow predictors by integrating the mechanisms of PSO, neural network and fuzzy inference system, to adapt to the time-varying traffic flow characteristics and the time-varying configurations of the on-road sensor systems. The proposed IPSO was applied to forecast traffic flow conditions on a section of freeway in Western Australia, whose traffic flow information can be captured on-line by the on-road sensor system. These results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of using the proposed IPSO for real-time traffic flow forecasting based on traffic flow data captured by on-road sensor systems.

In this paper, we propose some moving rules for modeling the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians. The modified visual angle car-following model is presented for the movement of vehicles with consideration of the lateral effect of waiting pedestrians. The pedestrians' behavior is summarized as consisting of three steps: pedestrian arrival, gap acceptance, and pedestrian crossing. Some characteristic parameters of pedestrians are introduced to characterize pedestrians' behavior. Simulation results show that the interaction of vehicles and pedestrians lowers the traffic capacity and increases delays to both vehicles and pedestrians. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The model takes into account the mechanism of a driver's oscillation behavior obtained from engineering experiments in real traffic conditions. This mechanism shows the inner competition between speed adaptation and distance adjustment effects. The speed adaptation effect leads to synchronized flow, whereas a pinch region emerges, associated with the spontaneous occurrence of wide moving jams, due to distance over-adjustment. Numerical simulations are carried out both with periodic and with open boundary conditions in order to investigate the spatiotemporal features of traffic flow. The results indicate that our model is able to reproduce the three distinct traffic phases and exhibit the four congested patterns upstream of an isolated on-ramp, which is in good consistency with the results predicted from the three-phase theory.

The generic feature is a discontinuous character of driver over-acceleration caused by a combination of two qualitatively different mechanisms of over-acceleration: (i) Over-acceleration through lane changing to a faster lane, (ii) over-acceleration occurring in car-following without lane changing. Based on this generic feature a new three-phase CA traffic flow model is developed. This CA model explains the set of the fundamental empirical features of traffic breakdown in real heterogeneous traffic flow consisting of passenger vehicles and trucks. The model simulates also quantitative traffic pattern characteristics as measured in real heterogeneous flow. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Kurtze, DA				Kurtze, Douglas A.			Solitons and kinks in a general car-following model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							JAMMING TRANSITION; DENSITY WAVES; TRAFFIC JAMS; FLOW; EQUATION	We study a general car-following model of traffic flow on an infinitely long single-lane road, which assumes that a car's acceleration depends on time-delayed values of its own speed, the headway between it and the car ahead, and the rate of change of headway, but makes minimal assumptions about the functional form of that dependence. We present a detailed characterization of the onset of linear instability; in particular we find a specific limit on the delay time below which the marginal wave number at the onset of instability is zero, and another specific limit on the delay time above which steady flow is always unstable. Crucially, the threshold of absolute stability generally does not coincide with an inflection point of the steady-state velocity function. When the marginal perturbation at onset has wave number 0, we show that Burgers and Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations can be derived under the usual assumptions, and that corrections to the KdV equation "select" a single member of the one-parameter set of its one-soliton solutions by driving a slow evolution of the soliton parameter. While in previous models this selected soliton has always marked the threshold of a finite-amplitude instability of linearly stable steady flow, we find that it can alternatively be a stable, small-amplitude jam that occurs when steady flow is linearly unstable. The model reduces to the usual modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation only in the special situation that the threshold of absolute stability coincides with an inflection point of the steady-state velocity function; in general, near the threshold of absolute stability the model reduces instead to a KdV equation in the regime of small solitons, while near an inflection point it reduces to a Hayakawa-Nakanishi equation.

The dynamics of vehicle passing and queueing as well as high mobility create distinctive propagation characteristics of wireless medium and inevitable uncertainty in space-time patterns of the vehicle density on a road. It is therefore of great importance to account for random vehicle locations in V2V communication. In this paper, we characterize intervehicle communication in a random field of vehicles, where a beacon or head vehicle (transmitter) broadcasts safety or warning messages to neighboring client vehicles (receivers) randomly located in a cluster on the road. To account for a doubly stochastic property of the VANET, we first model vehicle's random locations as a stationary Cox process with Fox's H-distributed random intensity (vehicle concentration) and derive the distributional functions of the lth nearest client's distance from the beacon in such a Fox Cox field of vehicles. We then consolidate this spatial randomness of receiving vehicles into a path loss model and develop a triply-composite Fox channel model that combines key wireless propagation effects such as the distance-dependent path loss, large-scale fading (shadowing), and small-scale fading (multipath fading). In Fox channel modeling, each constituent propagation effect is described as Fox's H-variate, culminating again in Fox's H-variate for the received power or equivalently the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the lth nearest client vehicle. Due to versatility of Fox's H-functions, this stochastic channel model can encompass a variety of well-established or generalized statistical propagation models used in wireless communication; be well-fitted to measurement data in diverse propagation environments by varying parameters; and facilitate a unifying analysis for fundamental physical-layer performances, such as error probability and channel capacity, using again the language of Fox's H-functions. This work serves to develop a unifying framework to characterize V2V communication in a doubly stochastic VANET by averaging both the small-and large-scale fading effects as well as the (random) distance-dependent path losses.

Inefficient traffic management leads to fuel wastage in volume of billion gallons per year. In this paper, we propose a dynamic traffic control framework using vehicular communications and fine-grained information, such as turning intentions and lane positions of vehicles, to maximize traffic flows and provide fairness among traffic flows. With vehicular communications, the traffic controller at an intersection can collect all fine-grained information before vehicles pass the intersection. Our proposed signal scheduling algorithm considers the flows at all lanes, allocates more durations of green signs to those flows with higher passing rates, and also gives turns to those with lower passing rates for fairness provision. Simulation results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing works by significantly increasing the number of vehicles passing an intersection while keeping average waiting time low for vehicles on non-arterial roads. In addition, we discuss our implementation of an Zigbee-based prototype and experiences.

Chaos, uncertain behaviours, demanding fluctuation, complexity of the traffic flow situations and the problems with those methods, however, caused the forecasting traffic flow values to lack robustness and precision. In this study, the traffic flow forecasting is analysed by emotional concepts and multi-agent systems (MASs) points of view as a new method. Its architecture is based on a temporal difference (TD) Q-learning with a neuro-fuzzy structure. The performance of TD Q-learning method is improved by emotional learning. The concept of emotional TD Q-learning method is discussed for the first time in this study. The forecasting algorithm which uses the Q-learning algorithm is capable of finding the optimal forecasting approach as the one obtained by the reinforcement learning. In addition, in order to study in a more practical situation, the neuro-fuzzy behaviours can be modelled by MAS. The real traffic flow signals used for fitting the proposed methods are obtained from interstate I-494 in Minnesota City in USA and the E17 motorway Gent-Antwerp in Belgium.

The model includes various groups of drivers, with different origins and destinations and having different cost functions. Under a natural set of assumptions, two main results are proved: (i) the existence of a globally optimal solution, minimizing the sum of the costs to all drivers, and (ii) the existence of a Nash equilibrium solution, where no driver can lower his own cost by changing his departure time or the route taken to reach destination. In the case of Nash solutions, all departure rates are uniformly bounded and have compact support.

J	Yao, RH				Yao, Ronghan			SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS OF OPTIMIZATION MODELS FOR TWO ADJACENT INTERSECTIONS WITH CORRELATED SHORT LEFT-TURN LANES	TRANSPORT			English	Article						adjacent intersections; correlated short left-turn lanes; optimization models; sensitivity analysis	CAPACITY; LENGTHS	The correlated short left-turn lanes sometimes exist on the common section between two adjacent intersections. These short lanes can reduce the approach capacity and impact on each other. According to operational research, three kinds of multi-objective optimization models are put forward in order to reasonably allocate the time-space resources of two intersections. Since the solutions to these models depend on the concrete forms of their objective functions, six feasible objective functions and the corresponding solution method are proposed. Next, the sensitivity of the optimization results to the parameters (minimum and maximum cycle lengths) is emphatically analyzed and compared. Moreover, to testify the effects of these models on traffic flow operations, three typical optimization scenarios are simulated together with the existing one. The models and methods are illustrated via the 2010 field data from the city of Dalian, China. Also, the better models and their suitable parameter values or ranges are recommended. Finally, the application procedure of the recommended models is given in actual engineering practice.

J	Siromascenko, AA; Lungu, I				Siromascenko, Alex-Alexandru; Lungu, Ion			A Massive Multilevel-parallel Microscopic Traffic Simulator with Gridlock Detection and Solving	STUDIES IN INFORMATICS AND CONTROL			English	Article						Parallel computing; Distributed computing; Multilevel parallelism; traffic simulation; gridlock		Traffic simulators based on microscopic models are a detailed approach to infrastructure and policy evaluation. They allow a closer to reality representation of the factors that influence traffic flow: individual driver and vehicle attributes, dynamic route decisions, lane changing and restrictions, driver cooperation. Such aspects add to the complexity and volume of computations, leading to slower simulation speeds compared to macroscopic models. Also, route restrictions can lead to gridlocks, a common problem in such simulations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level parallel architecture for the TrafficWeb microscopic traffic simulator. The solution combines random load allocation, for multi-threaded processing, and distributed parallelization, through geographical domain decomposition. Adaptive load balancing is used for optimizing the distributed processing speed. Gridlock detection and solving are employed through efficient parallel and distributed algorithms, significantly decreasing their cost. Performance tests show an overall efficiency of 85% for the multilevel-parallel architecture, on a cluster with 5 nodes, each having 4 cores. This allows simulating metropolitan traffic 85 times faster than in real time.

Based on the pioneer work of Konishi et al., we present a new feedback control scheme to suppress traffic jam in the coupled map car-following model under open boundary condition, which considers the effect of safe headway and optimal velocity difference on the traffic system from the perspective of tight conjoining between the transportation cyber system and the transportation physical system. According to the control theory, the condition under which traffic jam can be suppressed is analyzed. Both theoretical analyses and simulation results show that the suppression performance of our scheme is better than those of the previous schemes, although all the schemes can suppress traffic jam.

We envision this model as a framework for tractably evaluating and designing coordinated flow management capabilities at a multi-Center or even NAS-wide spatial scale and at a strategic (2-15 h) temporal horizon. As such, the queuing network model is expected to serve as a critical piece of a strategic flow contingency management solution for the Next Generation Air Traffic System (NextGen). Based on this perspective, we outline, in some detail, the evaluation and design tasks that can be performed using the model, as well as the construction of the flow network underlying the model. Finally, some examples are presented, including one example that replicates traffic in Atlanta Center on an actual bad-weather day, to illustrate simulation of the model and interpretation/use of model outputs.

In contrast with other time-series-based or spatio-temporal correlation methods, the proposed method focuses more on using the substantial mechanism of traffic transmission in road networks and the topology model of the entire UTN. Furthermore, this approach employs a speed-density model based on the fundamental diagram (FD) to obtain more accurate travel times in links. In the comparison experiment, the microscopic traffic simulation software CORSIM is adopted to simulate the real urban traffic. The experiment results fully verify the outstanding performances of the proposed prediction method.

A new macroscopic model taking into account the slope effects is developed using the relationship between the microscopic and macroscopic variables. The proposed model is applied to reflect the effect of the slope on uniform flow, traffic waves and small perturbation. The simulation results demonstrate that both the angle and the length of the slope have important impacts on traffic flow. The effect of the slope becomes more significant with the increase of the slope angle.

In particular, video tracking systems have been widely applied in traffic flow data collection and incident detection by tracking and analyzing vehicle trajectories through video image processing. Focusing on current vehicle tracking methods that are limited to complex traffic scenes such as target non-uniqueness and color distraction in real traffic situations, this paper proposes an improved Continuously Adaptive Mean Shift (CAMShift) method for automatic multi-vehicle tracking using video cameras. The proposed method firstly uses a background subtraction method for automatically detecting, selecting, and initializing targets, i.e., vehicles. Moreover, a motion estimation method is proposed for estimating vehicle motion states and predicting the new locations of the vehicles. Finally, both the color and edge feature distributions of the vehicles are extracted and a mixed model is established for searching the matching vehicles in the next image frame. The proposed method was comparatively evaluated with the traditional CAMShift method using the same video sequences captured from real traffic situations. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method is efficient for accurately tracking vehicle movements, and is promising for practical applications.

The focus of the research presented in this paper was to develop probabilistic models to predict breakdown of flow by using data from five freeway-ramp merging segments. The development of the probabilistic models allows exploration of several issues: the identification of breakdown, the performance measures for the identification of the breakdown, and the breakdown location. The breakdown probability model (BPM) is based on lifetime data analysis statistics. The breakdown probability models can be very useful tools in establishing capacity values, which in turn can be part of the freeway traffic management process.

J	Chang, HJ; Park, GT				Chang, Hyeong-Jun; Park, Gwi-Tae			A study on traffic signal control at signalized intersections in vehicular ad hoc networks	AD HOC NETWORKS			English	Article						VANETs; Signalized intersections; Real-time control; Queue length; ITS		The Seoul metropolitan government has been operating a traffic signal control system with the name of COSMOS (Cycle, Offset, Split MOdel for Seoul) since 2001. COSMOS analyzes the degrees of saturation and congestion which are calculated by installing loop detectors. At present, subterranean inductive loop detectors are generally used for detecting vehicles but their maintenance is inconvenient and costly. In addition, the estimated queue length might be influenced by errors in measuring speed, because the detectors only consider the speed of passing vehicles. Instead, we proposed a traffic signal control algorithm which enables smooth traffic flow at intersections. The proposed algorithm assigns vehicles to the group of each lane and calculates traffic volume and congestion degree using the traffic information of each group through inter-vehicle communication in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). This does not require the installation of additional devices such as cameras, sensors or image processing units. In this paper, the algorithm we suggest is verified for AJWT (Average Junction Waiting Time) and TQL (Total Queue Length) under a single intersection model based on the GLD (Green Light District) simulator. The results are better than random control method and best-first control method. For a generalization of the realtime control method with VANETs, this research suggests that the technology of traffic control in signalized intersections using wireless communication will be highly useful.

J	Shende, A; Singh, MP; Kachroo, P				Shende, Apoorva; Singh, Mahendra P.; Kachroo, Pushkin			Optimal Feedback Flow Rates for Pedestrian Evacuation in a Network of Corridors	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Conservation of mass; feedback linearization; linear programming; pedestrian evacuation; traffic flow model	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL; ROADS	This paper presents a methodology for the computation of optimal feedback flow rates (flow velocities and flow discharges) for pedestrian evacuation from a network of corridors using network-wide pedestrian congestion data. The pedestrian flow is defined in a macroscopic sense, wherein ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for each corridor and node are obtained using the conservation of pedestrian mass. The effect of congestion on the flow velocities and discharges in the corridor and the corridor intersections is explicitly modeled. Collectively, these corridor and node equations define the state-space model of the pedestrian flow in the network. The state variables signify the congestion in a corridor or an intersection, whereas the control variables directly affect the flow velocities and the flow discharges. For this model, an optimization-based control algorithm is developed to ensure a maximum total instantaneous input discharge that is subject to tracking the optimal congestion state and boundedness of the control variables. A comparison of the simulation results in the controlled and uncontrolled scenarios shows superior performance in the controlled case due to convergence to the optimal congestion state and consistently high network input and exit discharges.

Existing speed interpolation algorithms use the average speed time series collected from upstream and downstream detectors to estimate the travel time of a road link. Such approaches often result in inaccurate estimations or even systematic bias, particularly when the real travel times quickly vary. To get rid of this problem, Coifman proposed a creative interpolation algorithm based on kinetic-wave models. This algorithm reconstructs vehicle trajectories according to the velocities and the headways of vehicles. However, it sometimes gives significant biased estimation, particularly when jams emerge from somewhere between the upstream and downstream detectors. To make an amendment, we design a new algorithm based on the temporal-spatial queueing model to describe the fast travel-time variations using only the speed and headway time series that is measured at upstream and downstream detectors. Numerical studies show that this new interpolation algorithm could better utilize the dynamic traffic flow information that is embedded in the speed/headway time series in some special cases.

J	Han, YF; Moutarde, F				Han, Yufei; Moutarde, Fabien			Statistical traffic state analysis in large-scale transportation networks using locality-preserving non-negative matrix factorisation	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article						data analysis; matrix algebra; pattern classification; road traffic; statistical analysis; statistical traffic state analysis; large scale transportation networks; locality preserving non negative matrix factorisation; traffic management; traffic control; spatiotemporal traffic pattern extraction; LPNMF projections; temporal dynamics; spatial patterns; statistical traffic data analysis	MODEL; PREDICTION; SYSTEM	Statistical traffic data analysis is a hot topic in traffic management and control. In this field, current research progresses focus on analysing traffic flows of individual links or local regions in a transportation network. Less attention are paid to the global view of traffic states over the entire network, which is important for modelling large-scale traffic scenes. Our aim is precisely to propose a new methodology for extracting spatiotemporal traffic patterns, ultimately for modelling large-scale traffic dynamics, and long-term traffic forecasting. The authors attack this issue by utilising locality-preserving non-negative matrix factorisation (LPNMF) to derive low-dimensional representation of network-level traffic states. Clustering is performed on the compact LPNMF projections to unveil typical spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of network-level traffic states. The authors have tested the proposed method on simulated traffic data generated for a large-scale road network, and reported experimental results validate the ability of our approach for extracting meaningful large-scale space-time traffic patterns. Furthermore, the derived clustering results provide an intuitive understanding of spatial-temporal characteristics of traffic flows in the large-scale network and a basis for potential long-term forecasting.

Method: The primary objective is to develop separate crash risk prediction models for different weather conditions. The crash data, weather data, and traffic data used in this study were collected on the I-880N freeway in California in 2008 and 2010. This study considered three different weather conditions: clear weather, rainy weather, and reduced visibility weather. The preliminary analysis showed that there was some heterogeneity in the risk estimates for traffic flow characteristics by weather conditions, and that the crash risk prediction model for all weather conditions cannot capture the impacts of the traffic flow variables on crash risk under adverse weather conditions. The Bayesian random intercept logistic regression models were applied to link the likelihood of crash occurrence with various traffic flow characteristics under different weather conditions. The crash risk prediction models were compared to their corresponding logistic regression model. Results: It was found that the random intercept model improved the goodness-of-fit of the crash risk prediction models. The model estimation results showed that the traffic flow characteristics contributing to crash risk were different across different weather conditions. The speed difference between upstream and downstream stations was found to be significant in each crash risk prediction model. Speed difference between upstream and downstream stations had the largest impact on crash risk in reduced visibility weather, followed by that in rainy weather. The ROC curves were further developed to evaluate the predictive performance of the crash risk prediction models under different weather conditions. The predictive performance of the crash risk model for clear weather was better than those of the crash risk models for adverse weather conditions. Impact on industry: The research results could promote a better understanding of the impacts of traffic flow characteristics on crash risk under adverse weather conditions, which will help transportation professionals to develop better crash prevention strategies in adverse weather.

J	Jaarsma, R; Hermans, T; Rienks, W; de Vries, J				Jaarsma, Rinus; Hermans, Tia; Rienks, Willem; de Vries, Jasper			Enlarging of scale in dairy farming: Consequences for farm-bound traffic flows in the countryside	NJAS-WAGENINGEN JOURNAL OF LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Agricultural vehicles; Farm traffic; Logistics; Public minor roads; Traffic safety; Transportation planning	RURAL ROAD NETWORKS; LAND-USE	On average, farm units in the EU countryside are developing within the globalization process to an ever increasing physical and operational size. Within the last three decades, Dutch dairy farm holdings have increased their physical size by a factor of 3. This ongoing process can also be observed in other Western European countries. For Dutch dairy farming we explored the effects of future enlargement of physical and operational size from a transportation viewpoint. We focused on external farm-bound traffic flows with trucks and on internal flows with agricultural vehicles within the farm holding as far as these vehicles traveled on public minor roads. We modeled 3 situations for future dairy farming in a fictitious area called 'polder': 10 "Family Farms" (10 farm units each consisting of 85 ha and 120 dairy cows); and 2 "Cowmunities" (1 central farm building, 1200 dairy cows and 10 parcels of 85 ha each). Both Cowmunities differ in their land layout: 10 scattered parcels (the Cowmunity) versus a concentration of these parcels in one area around a central farm building (the Cowmunity plus). In both Cowmunities, we found a modest reduction of truck travel on minor public roads for external traffic. This reduction was enabled by more efficient freight transport to larger farm holdings. Contrary to this finding are the results for internal traffic with agricultural vehicles on these holdings. Longer distances between field parcels and central farm buildings in the Cowmunities cause a considerable growth of volumes and kilometers traveled by agricultural vehicles on public roads. This heavy traffic will likely conflict with other road users in the countryside and further increase existing road safety problems involving agricultural vehicles. Unfortunately, these impacts can only partly be reduced by an optimal land lay-out of the holding with a concentration of field parcels near the central farm building as in Cowmunity plus. To improve this situation, a two-pronged approach needs to be taken that carefully locates central farm buildings and adapts the network of minor rural roads to avoid "clashes" between agricultural and other road users.

J	Peursum, S; Wu, YH; Rehbock, V				Peursum, Sarah; Wu, Yong Hong; Rehbock, Volker			An analysis of traffic-flow stability in a microscopic heterogeneous network	ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SIMULATION; PHASES	Microscopic traffic-flow networks are typically designed to simulate vehicle acceleration behaviour using a single mathematical model. The concept of stability is a major objective of microscopic driver models for traffic simulations. Stable flow is traffic flow that does not fluctuate unaccountably, and changes in flow do not unreasonably magnify downstream, thereby reflecting real-world driver behaviour. However, the stability of driver models is typically evaluated in isolation, with the single model applied to all vehicles and road sections in the traffic network. Yet as different models will be more effective in different situations, it would be desirable to mix multiple models within the one traffic network. Heterogeneous approaches that mix microscopic and macroscopic models exist, but mixing different types of microscopic driver models has been largely overlooked and no analysis of the consequences on stability has been made. Thus this paper investigates the stability characteristics of such microscopic heterogeneous networks, mixing the well-known Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), a continuous-space car-following model, with a discrete-space cellular automata model. To this end, a flaw in the stability of the IDM at the speed limit is identified and corrected. Subsequently it is shown that model switch-over points will experience instabilities despite the stability of the individual driver models and, although careful choice of parameters can reduce the problem, it cannot be completely eliminated in practical road networks. However, the instability produces a signature 'fingerprint' effect on traffic density, and this fingerprint is readily identifiable using simple measures of traffic flow even in realistic road networks.

J	Li, L; Li, YB; Li, ZH				Li, Li; Li, Yuebiao; Li, Zhiheng			Efficient missing data imputing for traffic flow by considering temporal and spatial dependence	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic flow; Missing data; Temporal and spatial dependence; Probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA); Kernel probabilistic principle component analysis (KPPCA)	INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS; PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; IMPUTATION; MULTIVARIATE; PREDICTION; MODELS; REGRESSION; VALUES	The missing data problem remains as a difficulty in a diverse variety of transportation applications, e.g. traffic flow prediction and traffic pattern recognition. To solve this problem, numerous algorithms had been proposed in the last decade to impute the missed data. However, few existing studies had fully used the traffic flow information of neighboring detecting points to improve imputing performance. In this paper, probabilistic principle component analysis (PPCA) based imputing method, which had been proven to be one of the most effective imputing methods without using temporal or spatial dependence, is extended to utilize the information of multiple points. We systematically examine the potential benefits of multi-point data fusion and study the possible influence of measurement time lags. Tests indicate that the hidden temporal-spatial dependence is nonlinear and could be better retrieved by kernel probabilistic principle component analysis (KPPCA) based method rather than PPCA method. Comparison proves that imputing errors can be notably reduced, if temporal-spatial dependence has been appropriately considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traffic flow theory has provided significant resources, including models based on traffic flow fundamentals that reflect the underlying phenomena, as well as promote their understanding. They also provide the basis for many traffic simulation models. Speed-density relationships, for example, are routinely used in mesoscopic models. In this paper, an approach for local traffic state estimation and prediction is presented, which exploits available (traffic and other) information and uses data-driven computational approaches. An advantage of the method is its flexibility in incorporating additional explanatory variables. It is also believed that the method is more appropriate for use in the context of mesoscopic traffic simulation models, in place of the traditional speed-density relationships. While these general methods and tools are pre-existing, their application into the specific problem and their integration into the proposed framework for the prediction of traffic state is new. The methodology is illustrated using two freeway data sets from Irvine, CA, and Tel Aviv, Israel. As the proposed models are shown to outperform current state-of-the-art models, they could be valuable when integrated into existing traffic estimation and prediction models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The measurement method is based on the kinematic wave model with variable wave speed to account for non-steady state conditions that arise during acceleration/deceleration. We find that hysteresis takes place less frequently and in smaller amplitude than previously thought. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This includes modeling nodes (or discontinuities) such as inflow and outflow boundaries, merges and bifurcations (e.g. ramps) and nonhomogeneous roads. Nodes are usually fixed in space. This makes their implementation in Lagrangian coordinates where the coordinates move with the vehicle more complex than in Eulerian coordinates where the coordinates are fixed in space. To this end we derive an analytical node model. The article then discusses how to implement such sink and source terms in a discretized version of the kinematic wave model in Lagrangian coordinates. In this implementation several choices have to be made. Test results show that even with the most simple choices (discretization based on full vehicle groups and discrete time steps) accurate and plausible results are obtained. We conclude that the Lagrangian formulation can successfully be applied for simulation of networks of nonhomogeneous roads. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

They are in a continuous state of improvement due to their significant role in traffic microsimulations, intelligent transportation systems, and safety engineering models. This article uses the local linear model tree (LOLIMOT) approach to model driver's CF behavior to incorporate human perceptual imperfections into a CF model. This model defines some localities in the input space. These localities are fuzzy and have overlaps with each other. Specific models for each of the localities are then defined and combined in a fuzzy manner to predict the final output. The model was developed using real world dynamic data sets. Three different data sets were used for training, testing, and validating the model. The performance of the model was compared to a number of existing CF models. The results showed very close agreement between the real data and the LOLIMOT outputs.

J	Liu, Y; Li, P; Wehner, K; Yu, J				Liu, Yue; Li, Peng; Wehner, Kevin; Yu, Jie			A Generalized Integrated Corridor Diversion Control Model for Freeway Incident Management	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							VARIABLE MESSAGE SIGNS; AUTOMATIC-CONTROL; GENETIC ALGORITHMS; FEATURE-EXTRACTION; MOTORWAY NETWORKS; COST OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM OPTIMUM; ROUTE GUIDANCE	This article presents a generalized diversion control model for freeway incident management that is capable of concurrently optimizing the detour rates and arterial signal timings over multiple roadway corridor segments between the freeway and its neighboring arterial. To capture various operational complexities due to the interactions between multiple diversions, this study has developed an extended corridor traffic flow model and integrated it in the overall optimization process. A biobjective control model is developed to maximize the utilization of available corridor capacity while not significantly increasing the total time spent by travelers on the detour route to ensure their compliance to the routing guidance. Genetic algorithm integrated with the rolling time horizon approach is employed to solve the proposed model. Case studies with a stretch of the I-94 corridor westbound from downtown Milwaukee to Waukesha have demonstrated the potential of the developed model for use in nonrecurrent congestion management.

J	Bento, AM; Hughes, JE; Kaffine, D				Bento, Antonio M.; Hughes, Jonathan E.; Kaffine, Daniel			Carpooling and driver responses to fuel price changes: Evidence from traffic flows in Los Angeles	JOURNAL OF URBAN ECONOMICS			English	Article						Gasoline prices; Traffic congestion; Carpooling	OCCUPANCY VEHICLE LANES; UNIT-ROOT TESTS; PANEL-DATA; GASOLINE; TRAVEL; HOV	We examine carpooling and driver responses to fuel price changes. Using a simple theoretical model, we show that traffic flows in mainline lanes unambiguously decrease when fuel prices increase, and this effect is stronger when the presence of a carpool lane provides a substitute to driving alone. In contrast, in carpool (HOV) lanes flow can either increase or decrease. These predictions are tested using 8 years of traffic flow data for 1700 locations in Los Angeles. In our preferred specification, the mean elasticity of flow with respect to fuel price is 0.136 for HOV lanes. For a 10% increase in fuel price this implies 10 additional carpools per hour, $8.8 million per year in additional congestion costs for carpoolers and $11.3 million lower costs for mainline drivers. For mainline lanes, flow elasticities are 0.083 and 0.050 for highways with and without an HOV lane. These estimates imply that the mean highway with an HOV lane experiences a 30% larger decrease in hourly flow compared to the mean highway without an HOV lane. Flows in HOV lanes show an immediate decrease following a price increase but respond positively to price increases over time, which suggests time is an important input to carpool formation.

J	Peng, GH; Cheng, RJ				Peng, Guang-han; Cheng, Rong-jun			A new car-following model with the consideration of anticipation optimal velocity	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Optimal velocity model; Anticipation effect; Numerical simulation	TRAFFIC FLOW; MACRO MODEL; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FULL VELOCITY; DIFFERENCE; STABILIZATION; STABILITY	In this paper, a new anticipation optimal velocity model (AOVM) is proposed by considering anticipation effect on the basis of the full velocity difference model (FVDM) for car-following theory on single lane. The linear stability condition is derived from linear stability analysis. Starting and braking process is investigated for the car motion under a traffic signal, which shows that the results accord with empirical traffic values. Especially AOVM can avoid the disadvantage of the unrealistically high deceleration appearing in FVDM. Furthermore, numerical simulation shows that AOVM might avoid the disadvantage of negative velocity and headway that occur at small sensitivity coefficients in the FVDM since the anticipation effect is taken into account in AOVM, which means that collision disappears with the consideration of an appropriate anticipation parameter.

Simulations are carried out to check the validity of the dissipation model. Analysis of the results shows that the total energy consumption is inversely proportional to the slope in an uphill situation and the opposite conclusion can be drawn in a downhill situation. The energy dissipation rate depends on the density of traffic and the road length in two situations in a rule. It is found that the simulation result is in good agreement with real traffic.
