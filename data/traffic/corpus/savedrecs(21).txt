The overall framework, algorithm development, implementation and evaluation of. this technique are discussed. Freeway traffic flow parameters, measured by sensors,, such as occupancy and volume are used by the SVM models to detect incidents. The performance of the developed algorithms is evaluated, using the common criteria of detection rate (DR), false alarm rate (FAR), mean time to detection (MTTD), and misclassification rate (MCR). A performance index (PI) is then calculated by combining these performance criteria. Offline test results using real data collected at the I-880 Freeway in San Francisco Bay area, California have shown that the SVM models produce better Pis compared to the multi-layer neural network models.

In practice, traffic data from single loop detectors are one of the dominant data sources. Speed estimation from single loop detectors is mainly based on occupancy data, a conversion factor from occupancy: to density (which is potentially related to the vehicle length), and the assumed relationship between flow, speed, and density. This paper investigates the discrepancy between the speed estimated with single loops and the speed estimated with double loops. It was found that the discrepancy between the two is mainly caused by the high variance in vehicle pace, Which, especially under congested traffic, is often accompanied with the high skewness. Accuracy can be improved by computing occupancy in a different way, using the median vehicle passage time over the detector as opposed to the mean vehicle passage time often used in the conventional method. The performance of the enhanced speed estimation method is very promising. The use of the median vehicle passage time reduces the skewness of pace data.

In this paper, According to the chaotic property of urban traffic flow, we compute the parameters of phrase space reconstruction for traffic flow system. Meanwhile, a local-forecasting method is introduced to predict urban road short-term traffic flow based on the theory of phrase space reconstruction. Self-organizing Map (SOM), network is introduced to seek the near neighbor. Case study using, real. traffic flow data from UTC-SCOOT system proves the validity of the method. The research in this paper is a significant attempt to forecast traffic flow from the viewpoint of non-linear time series.

In the new model, error propagations of both the traffic density and the average velocity am considered and the extended Kalman filter is used to estimate all traffic states. To avoid a series of high-dimension. problems, a modified weighted Gram-Schmidt orthogonal U-D factorization method is used for the time update and measurement update of the extended Kalman filter to get high numerical stability and computational efficency. Considered the structure of system matrix, block matrix is used in U-D factorization algorithm. Results of simulation to 100 section states of freeway and actual application show that the new method can be efficiently used to estimation and prediction freeway traffic-flows.

As on-line, real-time simulation of a large number of possible scenarios is usually not tractable for even relatively small motorway networks, a fast method to predict the effects of control measures on-line is a key requirement for effectively applying traffic control. In this paper we develop a multi-agent case-based approach to assist traffic operators in evaluating or predicting the effects of control measures. The proposed approach is much faster than straightforward traffic simulation so that it can be used for on-line and real-time evaluation of a large number of different control, scenarios. In addition, it is scalable so that it can also be used for large networks.

Therefore, such data hours a day, even when it complement. remote sensing data. The data can be used, e.g., to. optimize traffic flow by controlling traffic lights dynamically. In case of stationary cameras, in order to minimize the-number of cameras it is useful to reidentify vehicles leaving one monitored region and afterwards entering the viewing field of a further camera. From reidentified vehicles travel times can be obtained which are relevant parameters to optimize traffic control. A method to reidentify vehicles based on extraction of 3-d-prototype vehicle models and color extraction from the top plane of vehicle, is presented. Shadows and light reflections on wet street I are corrected, and therefore, the high recognition accuracy is, achieved which is necessary to find the top plane of the vehicles. The algorithms are suitable for real-time applications used for remote. sensing methods can also be data. Reidentification of vehicles in remote sensing data is of interest, because vehicles can get lost for. a while, e.g., when high buildings parts of the street. prevent, a direct view onto parts of the street.

From the viewpoint of static traffic characteristic, they mainly provide information of traffic states (free flow or congestion) and trend of traffic variation in a highway section. However, dynamic properties observed in short time interval reveal that hysteresis phenomenon are likely to occur during traffic state-transitions. The hysteresis phenomenon is visible in the transition paths both in the flow-density and velocity-density diagrams. The cause of hysteresis is either due to drivers' asymmetrical desired control speed in anticipation and relaxation modes or on traffic conditions of demand and supply in upstream and downstream. The hysteresis transition shows how, the traffic quality degenerates and recovers during minutes to hours. It is thus expected that a better traffic flow modeling and control can be achieved if hysteresis transition can be correctly modeled and predicted. The paper develops a generalized mathematical hysteresis model based on Duhem operator. The hysteresis model proposed can describe hysteresis phenomenon in each state-to-state transition. Identification process is also introduced to make our model more flexible in different traffic conditions. Besides modeling, issue related to flow stage transitions and congested trend can be predicted or estimated, and, accordingly, some traffic control strategies can also be devised. For the traffic control, a performance index is proposed to evaluate transportation quality, and served as measure of traffic improvement or degradation. Some control rules and traffic assignment are recommended to improve transportation efficiency. Simulation results are provided to illustrate transitions between free flow states and congested states. The simulation results also show that our model can represent the hysteresis phenomenon in different state transitions.

The signal controller at a single intersection should control its traffic; moreover, consider the traffic among its neighbors. So the new fuzzy controller based on fuzzy logic and weighting coefficients is proposed. The fuzzy signal controller takes into account the coordination of signal timing between neighbor intersections. The weighting fuzzy module is developed to give the weights that the traffic flow at neighbor intersections imposes on the signal timing at current intersection. The fuzzy rules of the signal controller and the weighting module are produced by the traffic information with the vehicles detectors. The average delay time of a vehicle is used as a performance index. The parameters, that is, cycle time, green splits and phasing are optimized in the traffic network. The simulation results show better performances and adaptability. in the cases of time-varying traffic patterns compared with the full-actuated signal controller.

The pure-ALOHA, the slotted-ALOHA, and the non-persistent CSMA schemes are examined. In simulations, the capture effect and the propagation delay including the processing delay are considered, and the required frequency bandwidth is obtained from the average packets loss rate property. Simulation results show that the non-persistent CSMA is relatively superior to the ALOHA schemes. In addition, expanding the carrier sensing areas has an effect of saving the required frequency bandwidth, and the effect of the propagation delay on the performance of the non-persistent CSMA is evaluated.

Ramp metering can increase flow and prevent 4 traffic. breakdown by adjusting the metering rate. Speed control is to regulate and guide the traffic on the main freeway lanes to achieve stability of traffic flow. We formulate the ramp metering and variable speed control as a stackelberg game and ramp metering is regarded as the leader, variable speed control as the follower. Within this framework, we propose a stackelberg game model of ramp metering and variable speed control. At last, we use a simple network to illustrate our approach and the simulation results show that this approach is effective.

Cellular Automata mothod is often used for road traffic flow research, but its homogeneity restriction makes it impossible to modeling railway transportation system, because in railway transportation system the objects can not be divided into cells with same size and same transformation rule. Based on the research on railway transportation system's characteristics and Cellular Automata theory, the Entity Automata micro model is put forward in this paper. Entity Automata divide the objects in railway transportation system into several classes and every class entity has it own characteristics and transformation rule. It inherits the spatio-temporal computation characteristics of Cellular Automata and integrates object-oriented method. Simulation experiment result shows using entity automata to model and simulate railway transportation system is feasible.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		traffic flow; intelligent transportation system; hysteresis; cell-transmission model		Traffic flow models are used to characterize traffic behavior or to describe fundamental diagram (flow-density relationship) of traffic conditions. From the viewpoint of static traffic characteristic, these models mainly provide information of traffic states (free flow or congestion) and trend of traffic variation in a highway section or intersection. However, dynamic properties observed in short time interval reveal that hysteresis phenomenon are likely to occur during traffic state-transitions. The hysteresis phenomenon is visible in the transition paths both in the flow-density and velocity-density diagrams. The hysteresis is either due to drivers' asymmetrical desired control speed in anticipation and relaxation modes or on traffic conditions of demand and supply in upstream and downstream. The hysteresis transition shows how the traffic quality evolves during minutes to hours. It is thus expected that a better traffic flow modeling and control can be achieved if hysteresis transition can be correctly modeled and used in traffic prediction. The paper develops a generalized mathematical hysteresis model based on Duhem operator. The proposed hysteresis model can describe hysteresis phenomenon in each state-to-state transition. An identification process is also applied to make our model more flexible in different traffic conditions. Besides modeling, issue related to flow stage transitions and congested trend can be predicted or estimated, and, accordingly, some traffic control strategies can also be devised Simulation results are provided to illustrate transitions between free flow states and congested states. The simulation results also show that our model can represent the hysteresis phenomenon in different state transitions. The research is expected to shed light on intelligent transportation systems.

In order for these methods to be effective and deployable in real-time, there is a need to develop models that predict future traffic conditions in a computational time much less than real time. In this paper we report on parallel implementations for a class of Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) models, known as macroscopic DTA models. This class of models possess mathematical formulations which are solved using various algorithms. Two parallel decomposition strategies based on network topology and time are investigated and implemented in a distributed memory environment. Numerical results show that for the network topology based decomposition strategy, a speed-up of 5 is observed when the number of processors is 10 and the asymptotic speed-up is about 10. For the time-based decomposition strategy a speed-up of 6.5 is observed when the number of processors is 10 and the asymptotic speed-up is about 25.

IEEE, Syst, Man & Cybernet Soc		ITS; traffic network forecasting; dynamic assignment algorithm; data mining; association analysis; association rules mining		Recent development in ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) methods and technologies has moved traffic operating systems from passive to proactive control and management, where real-time and accurate traffic flow information is critical to actual implementation. So far many algorithms have been proposed for traffic network flow forecasting, but problems in accuracy and timeliness still remain to be the major obstacle for their successful applications. For example, presumed human travel habit and vehicle turning probabilities at intersections have greatly limited the use of dynamic assignment algorithm. In order to improve the forecasting and real-time responsiveness, a new algorithm based on data mining which can do association rules mining and association analysis is proposed here for predicting traffic network flow. Simulation results using Corsim 5.0 have demonstrated effectiveness of the new algorithm in both accuracy and timeliness.

The proposed methodology is based on a multi-level system architecture integrating two decision levels, namely the dynamic route guidance level and the traffic signalling control level. The former level implements an approach for the determination of the optimal turning rates of vehicles travelling within the considered urban area. Basing on these values, in the latter level, a mathematical programming-based methodology determines the optimal duration of the phases of various traffic signalling systems in the considered area. A third level, namely the data collection and state estimation level, is also included in the proposed architecture and discussed in the paper.

The accuracy of NVWQ estimation using the fuzzy neural networks approaches is more than 90%. The fuzzy neural networks have advantages of both fuzzy expert systems (knowledge representation) and artificial neural networks (learning). The fuzzy neural networks can be trained successfully to estimate NVWQ for different traffic flow patterns and different conditions intersection. This greatly reduces a lot of effort of extracting traffic expert's knowledge into fuzzy if-then rules. All we have to do is to present training data to the network which will figure out its own rules through internal representation.

Gray neural network can elaborate advantages of both grey model and neural network, and enhance further precision of forecasting. The GNN model is employed to forecast a real vehicle traffic flow of JINGSHI highway with favor precision and result, which is firstly applied GNN to traffic flow forecasting. Evaluation method has been used for comparing the performance of forecasting techniques. The experiments show that the GNN model is outperformed GM model and neural network model, and traffic flow forecasting based on GNN is of validity and feasibility.

In particular, we consider discrete-valued variable speed limits. Moreover, we also impose a safety constraint that prevents drivers from encountering speed limit drops larger than, say, 10 km/h. The control objective is to minimize the total time that vehicles spend in the network. This approach results in dynamic speed limits that reduce or even eliminate shock waves.

In particular, we use an extended version of the METANET traffic flow model to describe the evolution of the traffic flows in the freeway part of the network. For the urban network we propose a new model that is based on the Kashani model. Furthermore, we also describe the interface between the urban and the freeway model. This results in an integrated model for mixed freeway and urban traffic networks. This model is especially suited for use in a model predictive traffic control approach.

The model uses cellular automaton theory to model complex traffic behavior. The advantage of the cellular automata approach is that the roadway to be modeled is quantized into simple homogeneous cells, time is quanitzed into discrete steps, and physical quantities take on a finite set of values. Also, the state of the cells is updated at each discrete timestep by using a vehicle update algorithm that combines a few vehicle motion models, governed by a relatively small set of parameters. Then vehicles just move one or several cells at each discrete timestep according to the self-defined rule. This approach makes the computer operation feasible. At last, the paper put forward a suppose that if the simulation system is equip with the self-study system of NN (neural network) module according to the statistical data from the transducer fixed on the freeway, it can predict the traffic status ahead of 10 minutes.

Until now, numerous formulations and solutions approaches have been introduced ranging from mathematical programming to variational inequality, optimal control, and simulation-based. Static traffic assignment model has some shortcomings, for example, it's not capable of describing the dynamic traffic flow in urban transportation networks. So, promoted by the research work in ITS, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) theory became a focus research area. Genetic algorithm (GA), as an excellent global optimization algorithm, has been applied extensively. With the development of high performance computing technology, parallel system and parallel computing theory became another hotspot. Based on above theoretical bases, in this paper we propose an optimal control model of Master/Slave parallel genetic algorithm to solve DTA problem. Based on the Drawing cluster with distributed storage and message passing system, our algorithm is implemented in the Master/Slave mode of the PVM parallel platform. We test our model by applying it on example transportation networks. The experimental results showed excellent system operation indices and parallel efficiency, which proves the validity of our model.

An analysis was conducted preliminarily on the actual mobility system, which underlined the present critical points. Multiple scenarios were introduced, bringing into account different time horizons, each characterized by infrastructural and mobility government actions. The planned interventions consist in the regulation of circulation and parking, in the development of public transport and in the development of new roads and parking blocks. The adopted actions are evaluated simulating, by the use of suitable quantitative techniques, the functionality of the transport network, in the different action and demand evolution scenarios. The traffic flow conditions of private vehicles were estimated on the links of the network, (flows, speed and congestion levels); the flow conditions of the public transport vehicles were simulated separately, on the assumption that the latter run on protected or separate lanes, in particular on roads were the risks of congestion are higher. For the different scenarios, in function of the flow characteristics, the total emissions of different pollutants (CO, NOx, etc.) were calculated separately for private and public transport, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed actions. A financial and an economic evaluation on the effects of the different proposed actions was possible by the application of the results of the study.

Heterogeneity and inconsistency of driver behaviour and interactions at entrances of two-lane intersections are simulated by incorporation of different categories of driver behaviour and reassignment of categories with given probabilities at each time step. The method is able to reproduce many features of urban traffic, for which gap-acceptance models are less appropriate. Vehicles on entry roads are allocated to lanes based on queue-length on each lane. Two two-lane roundabout models are developed with different vehicle lane-allocation patterns. Various properties of two-lane intersection operations have been explored including throughput, turning rates, critical arrival rates and congestion on the intersections. Vehicle movements in this paper relate to left-side driving, such as found in UK and Ireland. However, rules are generally applicable.

In particular, theme-oriented fairs and festivals, such as arts and crafts fairs and wine and jazz festivals, are growing in number and-popularity throughout the United States. Quantifying and understanding the traffic characteristics of fairs and festivals would be useful in predicting how such events will affect traffic flow on a low-volume road, planning traffic management, and predicting parking needs. One specific need is for trip-generation data for estimating the magnitude and nature of travel associated with theme-oriented fairs and festivals. Background data were collected for a number of West Virginia events on low-volume roads through interviews and questionnaires. Five categories of theme-oriented fairs and festivals were identified: food and drink, arts and crafts, cultural heritage, historical, and performing arts. The number of booths was recommended as the best independent variable to use in calculating trip-generation rates. Attendance and vehicular data were collected and analyzed. Vehicle occupancy for theme-oriented fairs and festivals was determined to be 2.33 people per vehicle. Trip-generation rates and corresponding statistics were determined for 2-day (Saturday and Sunday) and 3-day (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) events. Implications of the study results for low-volume roads managers were considered.

In this paper, we describe a more advanced vehicle model identification technology, that is, a technology for detecting a particular model (model B of company A). This method does not read license plates or involve communication between the vehicle and the road, but identifies the vehicle model by using only roadside equipment. This algorithm recognizes the model by voting based on the arrangement of local features and has the following characteristics: (1) Detection is possible even if the target vehicle is occluded; (2) There is no dependence on the traveling position of the target vehicle; and (3) The vehicle region does not have to be extracted from the input image. First, we verify the above advantages in outdoor experiments by confirming the ability of the method called the eigenwindow method to recognize a specific model in the traffic flow. Next, we report on the successful improvement in the processing speed without a drop in the recognition accuracy by slightly modifying the implementation and using an image processing board.

Short-run and long-run emissions of CO, RC, NOx, and CO2 and fuel consumption are estimated. In the short run, with traffic volumes held constant, results demonstrate that the smoothing of traffic flow will result in reduced emissions. Long-run emissions are simulated by synthetically generating new trips into the simulated networks to represent potential induced travel. This is done until a "break-even" level of emissions for each pollutant and fuel consumption is reached that is equivalent to the base level before the traffic flow improvement was added. By also calculating short-run changes in travel time from the improvement, the travel time elasticity equivalents for each pollutant are calculated. These values are compared with travel time elasticities in the literature to evaluate whether long-run emissions benefits are likely to endure. Simulations are conducted using different assumptions of vehicle soak time to simulate cold-start and hot-stabilized operating modes. Results indicate that, in most cases, long-run emissions reductions are unlikely to be achieved under the two scenarios evaluated.

The basis of model development was the field survey as well as other statistics obtained from several road transportation agencies. A mathematical relationship was developed based on the fuel consumption as a dependent variable and several effective independent parameters. The basic independent variables which illustrated a high degree of relationship with the dependent variable are such as; roadside width, average longitudinal grade, shoulder width, level of service, and the ratio of heavy vehicles to the total traffic flow. Based on the comprehensive analysis on the collected data, the linear function was found to illustrate a high degree of predictability.

The simulation of traffic with a within-day dynamic approach is necessary, in order to represent the formation and dissipation of the vehicles queues, due to the presence of over saturation phenomena. The model, implemented inside a general assignment procedure, allows to obtain evacuation time and traffic parameters during the dynamic evolution of the evacuation phases.

It is implemented by utilizing the inbuilt database and spatial routines of a popular commercial Geographical Information System (GIS). The noise calculations can be made according to either of two alternative noise calculation models: the UK CORTN and US FHWA models. These models are applicable for calculating noise levels along highways with free flowing traffic. By applying the inbuilt spatial operations to the geographically located information, noise emission values can automatically be provided for any number of receptor points using either algorithm. The graphical user interface of the GIS simplifies the input of the attributes of the different receptor points and road links. Line and block barriers can be defined and applied with the interpolation technique for calculating traffic noise on receiver points along the back edge of barrier parallel to roadway. As a result, all noise levels behind the barrier can be efficiently estimated. In addition to the calculation of noise emission values for a specified set of receptor points, the variation in the noise levels along the highway can be visualized in the form of noise contours. Such contours provide a visual description of the soundscape and also information on the importance of different factors for soundscape quality. By changing traffic flow parameters such as the localization of planned roads, dwellings, and barriers with different size and location, TNoiseGIS functions as a road traffic noise prediction tool and a tool for planning environmentally friendly road and road traffic noise solutions. The noise calculations and visualization algorithms are implemented by means of scripts that will be made available at a lower cost and also user modifiable. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Traditionally, travel information systems have been specific to a particular mode of transport. For instance, traffic information (road conditions broadcast) has been directed at drivers. Instead, travel information systems are now being developed which incorporate route guidance systems to divert drivers away from the congested areas either by change of travel mode or travel route. The mobile travel information system developed at The Nottingham Trent University enables progression from a passive mode of interaction between traffic control systems and road-users (one-way flow of information) to an active mode. The integration of data concerning traffic flows and individual journey plans thus makes it possible to perform optimisation of travel. This paper focuses on the issue of provision of real-time information about urban travel and assistance with planning travel. Nottingham's SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) traffic-light control system provides real-time information about the link travel times within certain areas of the city. However, rather than using link travel times at the time of the request, it is more effective to predict the link travel times for the time of travel along the particular links. The future link travel times depend upon the historical travel time of the link (for the specific time step in the day) as well as the current link travel time. Consequently, the link weights are a combination of real-time data, historical data and static data. The prediction method will be validated in the context of Nottingham's urban road network. The results will be presented at the conference.

For the future a growth of traffic load on the existing infrastructure caused by freight transportation is forecasted. To cope this expected volume of traffic the existing infrastructure has to be used more effective. To improve the traffic flow two starting points are possible. A high potential can be expected of an increase of the valid top speed for trucks up to 100 km/h. Increasing the maximum payload per vehicle simultaneously the truck rate of the overall traffic can be reduced conspicuously. This paper exposes the advantages a truck with an increased payload, a "Roadtrain", offers in terms of traffic flow, fuel consumption and cost effectiveness. Ika and fka reviewed possibilities for the technical realization of the Roadtrain-concept, investigated solutions in detail and identified open questions for bringing the Roadtrain on European highways.

To address safety and operational concerns caused by truck traffic, a multitude of restriction policies have been instituted around the United States. This study was aimed at determining the operational and safety impacts of the 24-h restriction of trucks from using the median lane of a six-lane freeway corridor, Interstate 75 in Florida. It should be noted that traffic flow on this corridor is relatively uncongested and the corridor operates at Level of Service B or better throughout the day. Analysis of field and simulation data indicated that the difference between truck and passenger car speeds and travel times were insignificant on the unrestricted middle and shoulder lanes. About two-thirds of both passenger cars and trucks were traveling within the 10-mph pace that ranged from 70 to 80 mph in the corridor, which has a speed limit posted at 70 mph. The field data also indicated that trucks were able to use the middle lane to pass 25% of the time during the truck peak-hour period with the assumption of a 10-s gap acceptance. In addition, simulation analysis indicated that opening all lanes to trucks increased the number of lane-changing maneuvers by 11% in the daytime, a phenomenon likely to increase crashes in the corridor.

Under general assumptions, the coefficients of such linear combinations become the unknowns of a finite-dimensional nonlinear programming problem. We propose to insert "free" parameters to be optimized in the basis functions, too. This justifies the term "Extended Ritz Method." If the optimal solutions of functional optimization problems belong to classes of d-variable functions characterized by suitable regularity properties, the Extended Ritz Method may outperform the Ritz method in that the number of free parameters increases moderately (e.g., polynomially) with d, whereas the latter method may be ruled out by the curse of dimensionality. Once the functional optimization problem has been approximated by a nonlinear programming one, the solution of the latter problem is obtained by stochastic approximation techniques. The overall procedure turns out to be effective in high-dimensional settings, possibly in the presence of several decision makers. In such a context, we focus our attention on large-scale traffic networks such as communication networks, freeway systems, etc. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes of the networks (i.e., the decision makers acting at the nodes) may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. Consequently, a dynamic routing problem arises that cannot be solved analytically.

In particular, well-posedness theory of various nonequilibrium continuum models of traffic flow are established. One such a model is an inhomogeneous traffic flow model which allows road situation changes. The road situation changes arise naturally from obstacles, curvature, number of lanes, speed limit and others. Our proposed inhomogeneous model is a system of nonlinear hyperbolic equations in which the flux and the source terms depend on the space variable. We show the global existence of solutions and their convergence to a solution of the equilibrium equation as the relaxation time goes to zero. Furthermore, a traffic flow model with a nonconcave fundamental diagram is studied. The model is a system of nonconcave hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation. A nonconcave fundamental diagram is observed in real traffic flow. Other more realistic traffic flow models are discussed.

Microscopic traffic simulators can model traffic flow in a realistic manner. In this paper, a framework of a microscopic urban traffic simulator based on Multi-Agent System is introduced. The traffic light control agent and the vehicle-driver agent, which are the most important agents, are described in detail. The agents are implemented in a prototype simulator program written in MS C++, which consists of multi-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights and vehicles. Under the environment of the simulator, preliminary experiments have verified the efficiency of a reinforcement learning traffic light control method designed by us.

The primary goal is to study the design and implementation of vehicle- vehicle/roadside-vehicle communication system, which enhances an ACC system to a CACC one. In addition, the impact of market penetration of ACC/CACC vehicles and controller aggression are also evaluated. Two simulation works are presented. The microscopic study simulates a single ACC/CACC vehicle in cut-in scenario using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Simulation shows that CACC system saves control effort over ACC system. In the macroscopic work we simulate ACC/CACC controlled highway merging with SHIFT language. The results show beneficial effects of communication in both efficiency (average velocity) and cost (braking effort). The higher the market penetration of controlled vehicles the better the system performs. The aggressiveness of controller has mixed influence, which provides a tradeoff between efficiency and safety.

The provision of traffic information to travelers usually involves different parties that have distinctive objectives: travelers are concerned with benefits of travel-time savings at an affordable service charge, private information service providers (ISPs) seek to provide marketable information services from which they can derive a profit, and traffic management centers (TMCs) have the responsibility to maintain and improve system performance, especially to minimize the total system travel time. How transportation system managers can analyze the trade-offs among these objectives and adjust this new traffic-information flow diagram to improve system performance remains an open question. The trade-offs needed among the conflicting multiple objectives of different parties are studied, and traffic system performance is analyzed. The complex traffic network is formulated as a bilevel program. The upper level can be formulated by using various objective functions, such as the objectives for ISP and TMC. The lower level is a multiclass dynamic traffic-assignment model, which determines dynamic traffic flows in the network by considering the information dissemination strategies provided by the upper-level model. Numerical results of a small network are provided to illustrate the behavior of this model, and they prove that when there is congestion in the dynamic transportation network, appropriate subscribed rates benefit both all travelers and system performance, while the ISPs' information influences little without congestion in the transportation network.

So far many algorithms have been proposed for traffic network flow forecasting, but problems in accuracy and timeliness still remain to be the major obstacle for their successful applications. For example, presumed human travel habit and vehicle turning probabilities at intersections have greatly limited the use of dynamic assignment algorithm. In order to improve the forecasting and real-time responsiveness, a new algorithm based on data mining which can do association rules mining and association analysis is proposed here for predicting traffic network flow. Simulation results using Corsim 5.0 have demonstrated effectiveness of the new algorithm in both accuracy and timeliness.

This paper gives an overview of the development, validation and use of a stochastic traffic flow simulation model for urban highways with heterogeneous traffic. An appropriate methodology for the collection and extraction of headway data has been suggested. The headways of urban mixed-traffic dominated by smaller vehicles like motorized two-wheelers can be modeled using Negative exponential distribution over a wider range of traffic flow. An attempt has also been made to model the traffic flow on a road stretch with bus stops. The random natures of the arrival pattern and dwell time of the buses have been suitably incorporated.

J	de Oliveira, MGS; Williams, B; Leonard, JD				de Oliveira, MGS; Williams, B; Leonard, JD			Determining traffic stream impacts of radar detectors using microscopic simulation	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						traffic flow; radar; simulation; speed control		Police radar is known to have an effect on the speed of drivers. This effect derives from the presence of vehicles equipped with radar detectors in the traffic stream and the reactions that the drivers of these vehicles have to radar. The level of impact on a traffic stream exposed to radar transmissions is a function of the proportion of radar detector equipped vehicles in the traffic stream, i.e., the radar detector density. Microscopic simulation can be used to model this impact. A microscopic simulator extension is proposed that allows determinations of this type to be carried out by adding the capability to model driver response to radar transmissions. This approach can also be applied to the modeling of other driver warning technologies such as changeable message signs. A case study using the proposed methodology to analyze different congestion and radar detector density levels is presented and discussed. The case study shows that the efficacy of using radar as a speed reduction strategy is a function of congestion and radar detector density, with the strategy being most effective for volumes levels between 200 and 1,400 vehicles per hour per lane.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Wu, TQ				Zhu, ZJ; Wu, TQ			Two-phase fluids model for freeway traffic flow and its application to simulate evolution of solitons in traffic	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						two phase flow; traffic flow; simulation	SCHEMES	A two-phase fluids model for mixing traffic flow on freeways has been proposed, where vehicles are decomposed into two parts (i.e., phases)-slow moving and fast moving-denoted by subscripts i = 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the fact that both phases should be at rest under traffic jam conditions, it is assumed that the vehicular speeds for both phases are functions of the global traffic density, so that traffic flux can be expressed explicitly, considering that the speed of the second phase may be decreased when the mass fraction of the first phase becomes large. In addition to the relation to global density of traffic, it is assumed that the speed of vehicles in the second phase also depends on the mass fraction for the first phase. By neglecting the traffic generation rate, the governing equations from the mass conservation law were solved numerically with the Yee-Roe-Davis second-order symmetrical total variable diminishing algorithm. Two cases were considered: first, that there exists a soliton in the initial distribution of global density; second, that there is an initial uniform global density. Both cases were allowed to have a soliton in the initial density for the slowly moving vehicles. The numerical results indicate that the evolution of a soliton in traffic is quite different from those in water wave problems. The initial solitary-wave perturbation has been distorted dramatically. It was found that the presence of a soliton just in the slowly moving vehicles can increase global density, which means that traffic mixing can be viewed as a source of density wave production. Under very congested traffic flow, the speed for moving vehicles fast approaches that of vehicles in the first part.

Hence the Tokyo metropolitan government is considering the enforcement of 'road pricing' as one of the policies of Transportation Demand Management (TDM). Four kinds of pricing-boundary schemes proposed by the Tokyo metropolitan government are considered. It is expected that air pollution would partly deteriorate just beyond the pricing boundary due to detouring traffic but that would gradually improve. It's necessary to consider such environmental deterioration when enforcing road pricing albeit the research is not complete. Hence the purpose of this study is to quantitatively evaluate such environmental deterioration. The present traffic condition was represented by the traffic simulator VISUM/DYNEMO that includes the fluid traffic-flow model which is effective for reproducing the heavy traffic flow in macro scale network such as the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. The traffic-simulation model was then verified by comparing the simulated and observed traffic volumes. Finally, we evaluate the total improvement and the partial deterioration due to road pricing. This study determined which pricing-boundary scheme is the best with respect to the impact of detouring vehicles.

Several studies have derived general results without decisive conclusions or with partial coverage to assist the users in the selection process. Simulation modeling is used to compare operational traffic performances of isolated SPI and TDI without frontage roads. Modeling was conducted on similar geometries over a wide distribution of traffic flow conditions (101 scenarios). The 101 scenarios were run for both SPI and TDI to derive control delay, stop time, and percent stops from CORSIM. The multivariate statistical comparison of all three variables showed a combined significant difference between the two interchange types, favoring SPI. TDI created more delay, stop time, and percent stops when the left-turn off-ramp flows were very high. Regression models were derived to estimate the three measures for both SPI and TDI. The models are robust and are functions of the highest flows on the cross street and off-ramps. These models are tools that can help planners in the evaluation and selection process of these interchange configurations.

J	Liu, ZZ; Zhou, XJ; Liu, XM; Luo, J				Liu, ZZ; Zhou, XJ; Liu, XM; Luo, J			Density waves in traffic flow of two kinds of vehicles	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							SOLITON; MODEL; DERIVATION; EQUATION; JAMS	Through the car-following model, the traffic flow of two types of vehicles (cars and trucks) on a single-lane flow is studied, in which drivers on different vehicles have different sensitivities and the safety distance is assumed to be the same for all vehicles. The linear analysis is carried out to determine the condition of critical stability. With the nonlinear analysis, it proves that the small fluctuation of the vehicle density near the critical stable state satisfies the Korteweg-deVries equation and different sensitivities affect only the soliton evolution. When the headway in the critical state is more than the safety distance, the density around the soliton peak exceeds the density of the critical stable state, which can be explained as the formation of traffic jam. Contrarily, when the headway state is less than the safety distance, drivers will increase the headway to avoid the jam. The direct approach of the soliton perturbation shows that drivers' sensitivity will increase the soliton's amplitude continuously. Moreover, the increase of the number of trucks in the traffic flow will slow down the evolution of the amplitude.

In this work, a GIS based analysis of the theoretical potential to be installed on noise barriers along Italian national roads has been carried out. Estimation of the road extent to be equipped with PV sound barriers has been obtained by provisional algorithms, on the basis of traffic flow, global radiation, meteorological conditions, geometrical and morphological configuration of the surroundings. The results reveal the presence of many suburban road sections acoustically affecting built-up areas with a favourable exposition to solar radiation and the existence of a large market where photovoltaics can be efficiently integrated into acoustical mitigation interventions.

The SMM is a hybrid system that switches among different sets of linear difference equations, or modes, depending on the mainline boundary data and the congestion status of the cells in a highway section. Using standard linear systems techniques, the observability and controllability properties of the SMM modes have been determined. Both the SMM and a density-based version of the CTM have been simulated over a section of I-210 West in Southern California, using several days of loop detector data collected during the morning rush-hour period. The simulation results show that the SMM and CTM produce density estimates that are both similar to one another and in good agreement with measured densities on I-210. The mean percentage error averaged over all the test days was approximately 13% for both models.

These shock waves result in longer travel times and in sudden, large variations in the speeds of the vehicles, which could lead to unsafe and dangerous situations. Dynamic speed limits can be used to eliminate or at least to reduce the effects of shock waves. However, in order to prevent the occurrence of new shock waves and/or negative impacts on the traffic flows in other locations, coordination of the variable speed limits is necessary. In this paper we further extend our results in connection with a model predictive control (MPC) approach to optimally coordinate variable speed limits for freeway traffic. First of all, we include a safety constraint that prevents drivers from encountering speed limit drops larger than, e.g., 10 km/h. Furthermore, to get a better correspondence between the computed and the applied control signals, we now consider discrete-valued speed limits.

It is shown using a microscopic model, that for any monotonically increasing spacing policy, the induced traffic flow on a circular highway is asymptotically stable. When a spatially discrete macroscopic highway model is considered, the traffic will be stable when the biasing strategies or mixing parameters are chosen appropriately, depending on the slope of the density-flow curve. This result indicates that when macroscopic highway model is considered, consistent biasing strategy must be chosen to be consistent with the microscopic model. These results therefore extend our previous results for the Constant Time Headway (CTH) policy to generic ACC policies. Based on these results, a complete analysis of the effect of boundary conditions on traffic stability for open stretch highways populated by ACC vehicles is performed. These results have been verified by microscopic simulations.

From a network-wide perspective, traffic bottlenecks occur most likely as a result of the unbalanced traffic flow distributions on freeway corridors. To analyze the potential network flow distribution issues, traffic assignment models with link capacity side constraints are desirable to solve highway network bottleneck problems. More importantly, one can design beneficial route guidance strategies according to the results of traffic assignment. In the present research, an operational traffic assignment model with link capacity side constraints has been developed to on-line predict traffic bottlenecks on freeway corridors. A set of route guidance control strategies for freeway motorists are proposed in accordance with traffic assignment results. A local freeway/highway corridor was employed to test the feasibility of the proposed model. The test results indicate that the proposed model is capable of predicting traffic bottlenecks, and corresponding route guidance strategies provide suitable route diversion and trip rerouting suggestions.

To understand the concept of capacity, it is essential to understand the relationship between speed and distance headway. This paper makes a comprehensive analysis of distance headways, including safe distance headway and desired one. The former is decided by the demand to the degree of safety, and the latter depends on the motorists' behavior, i.e. the model of traffic flow. Both of them are function of speed. According to the characteristics of their curves, we can find a crossing point that is the capacity of a road segment. This capacity represents the maximum flow rate meeting the minimum safety requirement.

In this paper, cellular automaton (CA) traffic simulator is applied to investigate the self-organization forming process as the traffic density grows. Real traffic data are used to examine whether the power law, an indicator of self-organization phenomenon, exists or not. Our empirical evidence on a two-lane freeway shows that self-organization phenomenon appears when the density exceeds 45% (or 60 pcu/km); however, the edge of chaos is at a density level of 33.8% (or 45 pcu/km), which should be the starting control point (e.g., ramp metering) for recurrent congestion.

The way to relieve traffic congestion includes expanding the capacity, improving transit service, amending traffic control,, etc.This paper proposes a solution for evaluating traffic policies to reduce traffic congestion in urban road network in Sukhumvit - Bangkok - Thailand. The main methodology is to construct Origin-Destination (O-D) demand matrices, to simulate traffic condition and to evaluate traffic policies. The probability distributions of link traffic flows were built from surveying and secondary data. The Least Squared Error Model has been applied to estimate Origin Destination demands from link travel time by using multi-path assignment. Then, the traffic simulation software NETSIM was utilized to simulate the actual traffic condition in Sukhumvit area. The improvement of traffic condition was presented by testing different traffic policies and infrastructure developments. Three scenarios are introduced in the paper: changing one-way roads to two-way roads, constructing new roads and changing one-way roads to two-way roads accompanied by constructing new roads. The proposed method is expected to apply in the design and planning not only for Sukumvit road network but also for other urban transportation networks in similar traffic conditions.

The railway transportation system is a typical temporal-spatial dynamic system. Recently the method with temporal-spatial computation characteristics, Cellular Automata, is often used for road traffic flow research, but it's homogeneity restricting make it 'impossible to modeling railway transportation system, for the objects can not be divided into cells with same size and same transformation rule in railway transportation system. Based on the research on railway transportation system's characteristics and Cellular Automata Theory the Entity Automata model is put forward. Entity Automata divided the objects in railway transportation system into several classes and every class entity has it own characteristics and transformation rule. It inherits the temporal-spatial computation characteristics of Cellular Automata and integrates object-oriented method. Simulation experiment result shows using Entity Automata to model and simulate railway transportation system is feasible.

The Freeway Traffic Management System(FTMS) of Korea contains incident detection algorithms and traffic incident certification modules. However, the function of predicting change of traffic flow condition in non-recurrent congestion such as incident is not yet provided. Research on which this paper is based on, has developed dynamic highway traffic simulation model for prediction of future traffic condition. This model used real time TCS(Toll Collection System) and VDS(Vehicle Detection System) data, while the CA(Cellular Automata) model was used as traffic flow simulator. From the field test, in and out traffic volume of freeway, split ratio of each direction, length of delay caused by incident and traffic condition after occurrence of incident were predicted. The predicted results were expressed two-dimension graphics by an animator developed in this research and evaluated by comparing with field traffic data.

A rolling training procedure continuously updating the traffic flow parameters is proposed to enhance the adaptability of FNAID to different traffic flow conditions. A real incident case is deliberately generated to calibrate the traffic simulator-Paramics. To validate the FNAID with and without rolling training procedure, the calibrated Paramics is used to simulate sufficient incident samples. The off-line tests and statistic tests conclude that under various traffic flow conditions, the FNAID with rolling training procedure has better detection performance than the one without rolling.

These models incorporate (nonlocal and time-delayed) braking and acceleration terms which are consistent with realistic time scales. Correlation assumptions are made such that braking and acceleration terms depend only on macroscopic densities and the relative speeds with respect to the average speed; the braking term includes lane change probabilities, and reasonable assumptions on the dependencies of these probabilities on the traffic situation lead to multivalued fundamental diagrams, consistent with traffic observations.

J	Greenberg, JM; Klar, A; Rascle, M				Greenberg, JM; Klar, A; Rascle, M			Congestion on multilane highways	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						microscopic and macroscopic traffic models; multiple equilibria; self-excited oscillations; travelling waves	TRAFFIC FLOW; MODELS	We present a new model for traffic on a multilane freeway (with n lanes). Our basic descriptors are the car density rho (in cars/mile), taken across all lanes in the freeway, and the average car velocity u (in miles/hour). The flux of cars across all lanes is given by rhou = (P) (n)(i=1) rho(i)u(i), where rho(i) is the car density in the ith lane, and u(i) the velocity of cars in the ith lane. We shall track only rho and u and not what is going on in each individual lane. On such multilane freeways, one often observes distinct stable equilibrium relationships between car velocity and density. Prototypical situations involve two equilibria, v = v(1)(rho) > v = v(2)(rho), 0 less than or equal to rho <rho(max), where v(1)(.) and v(2)(.) are monotone decreasing and satisfy v(1)(rho(max)) = v(2)(rho(max)) = 0. The upper curve is typically stable for densities satisfying 0 <= rho <= rho(1), whereas the lower curve is stable for densities satisfying rho(2) <= rho <= rho(max). Our interest is in the situation where 0 < rho(2) less than or equal to rho(1) < rho(max) and v(2)(rho(2)) <= v(1)(rho(1)). In this paper we present a model that incorporates both equilibrium curves and a simple switching mechanism which allows cars to transit from one equilibrium curve to the other. This switching mechanism, when combined with the continuity equation, produces relaxation or self-excited oscillations in the system, and these oscillations are what interests us here.

The mobile travel information system developed at The Nottingham Trent University enables the integration of data concerning traffic flows and individual journey plans thus making it possible to perform optimisation of travel. This paper focuses on the issue of provision of real-time information about urban travel and assistance with planning travel. Nottingham's SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) traffic-light control system provides real-time information about the link travel times within certain areas of the city. However, rather than using link travel times at the time of the request, it is more effective to predict the link travel times for the time of travel along the particular links. The future link travel times depend upon the historical travel time of the link (for the specific time step in the day) as well as the current link travel time. Consequently.. the link weights are a combination of real-time data, historical data and static data. Three prediction methods have been implemented and tested in the context of Nottingham's urban road network. The preliminary results suggest that the information discounting technique gives the best results.

The results are shown to demonstrate post-earthquake traffic behavior in animation. This will assist emergency response professionals to gain pre-event insight for developing optimal emergency response strategy. The basic element that plays a crucial role here is the fragility information for highway bridges in Caltrans' Freeway network. The fragility information is expressed as a function of the ground motion intensity, such as peak ground acceleration (PGA) or peak ground velocity (PGV), and is obtained empirically on damage database associated with the 1994 Northridge earthquake. The PGA and PGV values for the bridges are acquired from the TriNet ShakeMap. In this paper, the bridges are classified into different groups according to their structural characters and soil conditions. Based on the information, the fragility curves for different levels of damage are developed with the aid of the maximum likelihood method. The fragility information thus developed is integrated into the Monte Carlo analysis involving traffic flows, and degradation of traffic capacity of Caltrans' network in Los Angeles and Orange County damaged by the Northridge earthquake is evaluated. Furthermore, the network analysis results on the basis of fragility curves based on PGA and PGV are compared. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the actual performance of Caltrans' network during, the Northridge earthquake. This comparison shows that the seismic analysis based on the fragility information is very reasonable, and hence the animation of simulated traffic flow is quite useful.

For this reason, crash potential must be estimated on a real-time basis by monitoring the current traffic condition. In this regard, a probabilistic real-time crash prediction model relating crash potential to various traffic flow characteristics that lead to crash occurrence, or "crash precursors," was developed. In the development of the previous model, however, several assumptions were made that had not been clearly verified from either theoretical or empirical perspectives. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were to (a) suggest the rational methods by which the crash precursors included in the model can be determined on the basis of experimental results and (b) test the performance of the modified crash prediction model. The study found that crash precursors can be determined in an objective manner, eliminating a characteristic of the previous model, in which the model results were dependent on analysts' subjective categorization of crash precursors.

The global flow rates for different overall densities and mixing ratios between fast and slow cars are determined. We study two main scenarios: two-component traffic without passing restriction (uncontrolled flow) and traffic in which slow vehicles are prohibited to pass (controlled flow). We find that controlling the flow should considerably increase multi-lane highway capacity.

The flow and configuration of vehicles on two lanes in the model are simulated and three kinds of metastable local congested states are found in a two-dimensional region on the density-flow diagram. The first is that cars advance by stop and go-flow on their own lanes without lane-change and values of the flow are stable in time. The second is that cars change the lane periodically with several time-steps. The third is that they advance changing the lane that induces fluctuation of the flow with extremely long period. This fluctuation flow exists in a wide range between car densities 5/12 and 3/4. The metastable flow is discussed in connection with the synchronized states observed in the traffic flow on an expressway.

When passing is forbidden, growing clusters are formed behind slow cars and the cluster velocity distribution is governed by an exact Boltzmann equation which is linear and has an infinite memory. The distributions of the cluster size and the cluster velocity exhibit scaling behaviors, with exponents dominated solely by extremal characteristics of the intrinsic velocity distribution. When passing is allowed, the system approaches a steady state, whose nature is determined by a single dimensionless number, the ratio of the passing time to the collision time, the two time scales in the problem. The flow exhibits two regimes, a laminar flow regime, and a congested regime where large slow clusters dominate the flow.

Using numerical simulations of a recent stochastic car-following model [11] we show that this strategy yields optimization of traffic flow in systems with a localized periodic inhomogeneity, such as signalized intersections and entry ramps. The optimization process is explained by our finding of a generalized fundamental diagram (GFD) for traffic, namely a flux-density-wavelength relation. Projecting the GFD on the density-flux plane yields a two-dimensional region of stable states, qualitatively similar to that found empirically [7] in synchronized traffic. The empirical finding of the dependence of the wavelength on the average velocity can also be explained using the same approach.

However, stability of multi-lane flow is much less understood. In this paper, we study the effects of the relaxation time in car acceleration/deceleration equation,and of the number of lanes on the stability to unsteady disturbance. Multi-lane flow is less sensitive to the strength of the disturbance; once a weak disturbance causes a triggering lane change, that induces successive disturbances and lane changes, eventually resulting in randomly fluctuated flow. The road capacity is influenced mainly by the value of the relaxation time.

The crossings axe at every Cr site in the square lattice road and drivers turn at the crossing in order to arrive at their destination through the shortest route from the present position. As for driver, two kinds of drivers axe defined. When they can't advance through the shortest route by the congestion on the road, (1) the dynamic driver immediately changes the advancing direction at the crossing and (2) the static driver does not change the direction to keep the shortest route, but finally changes the route after waiting for Ts time-steps. The traffic flow is simulated by the CA model of these road systems, and effects of the route-choice behavior of the drivers on the occurrence of a traffic jam axe investigated. It has been found that the static drivers become the seeds for the global jam even if they are less and the supply of traffic information to the drivers can avoid the occurrence of the global jam by the encouragement of detours around the congestion.

Crossings located near freeway exits pose particularly acute problems, as long closures could result in vehicle queues that spill back onto freeway lanes. A potential solution to this problem was evaluated by investigating the use of variable message signs to divert exiting freeway traffic through non-congested alternate exits. This was done using the crossing near the Fredericksburg Road exit on Interstate 10 (I-10) in San Antonio, Texas, as a case study. In the evaluation, microscopic simulation was used to determine the impacts of train operations at the crossing and the potential benefits of a variable-message sign (VMS) system installed on I-10. These effects were gauged by considering scenarios with varying levels of train duration, traffic demand on the freeway exit, and driver compliance to the displayed messages. While little network improvements were obtained, the analysis demonstrates the capability of the INTEGRATION software in analyzing such scenarios and the extent to which exiting freeway traffic may benefit from the VMS system, as well as the need to consider fuel consumption and vehicles emissions in the evaluations.

The task was to predict the travel times between several observers along a one-lane rural road, given as boundary conditions the flow into this road and the flow out of it. By using nonlinear optimization, the best matching set of parameters for each of the models was estimated. For this particular data set, the models that performed best were the ones with the smallest number of parameters. The average error rate of the best models is about 16%; however, this value is not very reliable: the error rate fluctuates between 2.5% and 25% for different parts of the data set.

This theory is the basis for several predictions related to flow phenomena, including several about the way that the relative speeds and flows in different lanes change in transitions to and from congested flow. In particular, the theory asserts that the more aggressive drivers (referred to as "rabbits") always behave so as to maximize their speed. In congested flow, speeds are assumed to be nearly equal for all the lanes, and rabbits distribute themselves across the lanes so as to maintain this equality of speed. In acceleration downstream from queues, the equality of speed among the lanes breaks down once the free-flow speed of the slowest lane is reached, and the rabbits segregate themselves in the fastest lane. This redistribution of flow is expected to lead to two distinct flow states in queue discharge: capacity flow and discharge flow. Because the transition from capacity How to discharge How may lead to different overall flows and densities in the two states, a wave marking the transition between them may move either upstream or downstream. Automatically collected flow, occupancy, and speed data from freeways in the San Diego and Toronto areas were used to test these features of the theory at merge bottlenecks and in queue discharge following the removal of incidents. It was found that there are often speed differences among the lanes even in congested flow and that sudden redistribution of flow across the lanes can occur without speed equalization. These findings imply that Daganzo's behavioral logic is oversimplified and that something more than just maximization of speed by aggressive drivers is involved in the distribution of flow across the lanes.

A safety constraint incorporated in the controller is formulated that prevents drivers from encountering speed limit drops larger than, say, 10 km/h. The control objective is to minimize the total time that vehicles spend in the network. This approach results in dynamic speed limits that reduce or even eliminate shock waves. To predict the evolution of the traffic flows in the network, which is required by MPC, an adapted version of the METANET model is used that takes the variable speed limits into account. The performance of the discrete-valued and safety-constrained controllers is compared with the performance of the continuous-valued unconstrained controller. It is found that both types of controllers result in a network with less congestion, a higher outflow, and hence a lower total time spent for drivers. For the benchmark problem, the performance of the discrete controller with safety constraints is comparable with the continuous controller without constraints.

The parameter that has been found to best describe this characteristic of traffic streams is the arrival type. Though precise quantification of arrival type has been found to be difficult, the platoon ratio is a useful measure for this purpose. Thus, the quality of arrival of a traffic stream can be assessed by knowing the corresponding value of the platoon ratio. Study of arrival type over a wide range of traffic characteristics warrants theoretical modeling of traffic flow. In the study reported, an attempt was made to model heterogeneous traffic flow using an innovative technique. The developed model was used to study the arrival type of traffic streams, queue accumulation, and queue dissipation on approaches to traffic signals. The dispersal pattern of traffic platoons after vehicles pass a traffic signal was studied in detail. The effect of variation in traffic composition on traffic platoons was also analyzed.

It can also be a basis for implementing various model extensions, which may be easier with using one type of representation or the other. The hybrid model presented here combines a flow and a vehicular representation of the same model, which is the classical Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. The use of a simple and unique model makes it possible to focus on the specific problems raised by translating boundary conditions from vehicular to flow formulation and conversely. This translation is made in order to ensure the conservation of flow and proper transmission of information both downstream and upstream and to minimize the perturbations induced by transitions between a continuous and a discrete representation of flow. The resulting model is shown to have good properties, particularly concerning congestion propagation and flow smoothing at the interfaces between the two models.

The proposed macroscopic model is grounded on the assumption that freeway traffic may consist of multiple classes of drivers who, characterized by their unique speed-density relation, are likely to react differently under the same driving environment. The distribution of various classes of drivers and their differences in responding to perceived driving conditions may contribute significantly to the observed freeway traffic dynamics that remain to be better explained by existing traffic flow theories. The numerical solution and simulation results reported in this study, however, indicate that this proposed first-order multiclass model offers the potential to explore the complex interactions between freeway drivers and their collective impact on traffic flow patterns.

The main improvement this model has to offer is that vehicles are differentiated not only by their lengths but also by their speeds in a free-flow regime. Indeed, trucks on European roads are characterized by a lower speed than that of cars. A system of hyperbolic conservation equations is defined. In this system the flux function giving the flow of heavy and light vehicles depends on total and partial densities. This problem is partly solved in the Riemann case in order to establish a Godunov discretization. Some model output is shown stressing that speed differences between the two types of vehicles and congestion propagation are sufficiently reproduced. The limits of the proposed model are highlighted, and potential avenues of research in this domain are suggested.

The aims of the study are to analyze the behavior of flows within the merge area and to propose a methodology to dynamically estimate the capacity of both ramp and main line according to inflow patterns and to develop a mesoscopic model of merge facilities that allows the prediction of merge-area traffic outflow according to inflow patterns and to estimate traffic queue dynamics. The most relevant finding of the study is a methodology for estimation of the capacity of the merge area referred separately to both the main line and the ramp. The proposed approach could be considered as a link between the HCM hypotheses and those of gap-acceptance theory; the capacity of the competitive streams within the merge area depends on the opposing traffic volumes. The model gives information about traffic flows and queue dynamics (including total delay and maximum queue length). The first results of the application to a case study are briefly discussed, and some further developments are suggested.

A capacity model is set up for an unsignalized intersection in which the minor-stream mixed traffic flows cross m major lanes and the traffic flow headways fit the M3 distribution; it is an extension of minor-lane capacity theory for one vehicle type and one major-stream traffic flow. A more complicated case with minor-stream flow composed of discretionary vehicle types is also considered, and the corresponding formula is given. After field testing in China, the conclusion is drawn that this model is better for analyzing Chinese traffic conditions than are other existing models.

One-way traffic network benefit analysis should be considered from two parts, expenditure and saving. Five supposing conditions, the base of one-way traffic network beneficial analysis, are given. One-way traffic expenditure and saving are compared with traditional method and various potential effects brought by one-way traffic are considered synthetically. And then three aspects of benefits are analyzed. Formula of direct benefits is put forward. One-way traffic social indirect benefits are analyzed from three aspects. Social benefit of one-way traffic network is the sum of direct and indirect benefits. The calculation formula of the general cost of individual trippers is brought forward. Finally, one-way traffic network beneficial model is established and an example of Harbin city is made, by comparing its one-way traffic planning program with present condition, in order to analyzing the network economic benefits brought by one-way traffic planning program.

The Old Town transit center in San Diego, California is chosen as a case study in this paper. A problem of having long delays at this study location is described. Multiple trains operated by different agencies and multiple preemption events cause excessive delays and congestion to the traffic. Often preemption events will occur concurrently, and this will lead to certain traffic movements being delayed for extended periods of time. Therefore, we propose a strategy of using an adaptive traffic signal timing that can use multiple timing plans to operate traffic at this location. This paper also describes the current traffic volumes and a result of using computerized micro-simulations that provide a measure of effectiveness of both the current condition and the proposed condition with the proposed strategy. A computerized micro-simulation using VISSIM software package suggests that the adaptive traffic signal timing strategy leads to better traffic flow by reducing overall vehicle delays and queue lengths caused by multiple train crossings.								*AM RAILW ENG MAIN, 2001, COMM SIGN MAN REC PR; MARSHALL PS, 1989, INVESTIGATION RAILRO; POLK A, 2001, USE ITS IMPROVE SAFE; *PUBL UT COMM STAT, 1983, 75C PUBL UT COMM STA; *TRANSP RES BOARD, 2001, LIGHT RAIL SERV PED; *TRANSP RES BOARD, 2001, TRAFF SIGN OP NEAR H; *US DEP TRANSP, 2000, HIGHW TRAFF CONTR DE; *US DEP TRANSP, 1998, COD FED REG, pCH2; *US DEP TRANSP, 2000, MAN UN TRAFF CONTR D	9	0	0	0	3	HONG KONG UNIVERSITY SCIENCE &TECHNOLOGY	KOWLOON	CLEAR WATER BAY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG			978-988-97488-1-4				2003							388	395					8	Transportation; Transportation Science & Technology	Transportation	BIM89	WOS:000260962200047					2021-01-11

A CASE STUDY ON SHORT-TERM TRAVEL TIME FORECASTING IN HONG KONG	TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS			English	Proceedings Paper	8th Conference of the Hong-Kong-Society-for-Transportation-Studies	DEC 12-14, 2003	Hong Kong, PEOPLES R CHINA	Hong Kong Soc Transport Studies, Airport Authority Hong Kong, Univ Hong Kong, Dept Geography		Short-term travel time forecasting and traffic flow simulator	TRAFFIC FLOW SIMULATOR	In this paper, the short-term travel time forecasting is carried out by using the traffic flow simulator (TFS). The forecasted travel time information is useful for the pre-trip planning of the drivers. The drivers can decide their departure time and mode choice based on the forecasted travel time. A case study has been carried out in the Hong Kong Island during the AM peak period. The stochastic deviation coefficient is introduced in the case study to simulate the variation of traffic flows within the peak hour period. The purposes of the case study are: 1) to show the applicability of the TFS for larger-scale road network; and 2) to illustrate the short-term forecasting of link travel times. The results of the case study show that the TFS can be applied for large-scale network effectively. The TFS forecasted travel times and the observed travel times are compared. The findings show that the observed travel times fell in the 95% confidence interval of the TFS forecasted travel times.	[Chan, K. S.; Lam, William H.

The proposed method is an extension of the widely used trajectory method. The novelty of the presented method is that trajectories are based on the assumption of piecewise linear (and continuous at section boundaries) vehicle speeds rather than piecewise constant (and discontinuous at section boundaries) speeds. From these assumptions, mathematical expressions are derived that describe the trajectories within each section. These expressions can be used to replace their existing counterparts in the traditional trajectory methods. A comparison of the accuracy of the new method and of the existing method was carried out by using simulated data. This comparison showed that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) value for the new method is about half the RMSE value for the existing method. When this RMSE is decomposed in a bias and a residual error, it turns out that the existing method significantly overestimates the travel time. However, the largest part of the reduction of the RMSE value is still caused by a reduction of the residual error. In other words, if both methods are corrected for their bias, the new method performs significantly better.

A method for dealing with probe data along with conventional detector data to estimate traffic states is proposed. The probe data were integrated into the observation equation of the Kalman filter, in which state equations are represented by a macroscopic traffic-flow model. Estimated states were updated with information from both stationary detectors and probe vehicles. The method was tested under several traffic conditions by using hypothetical data, giving considerably improved estimation results compared to those estimated without probe data. Finally, the application of the proposed method was extended to the estimation and short-term prediction of travel time. Travel times were obtained indirectly through the conversion of speeds estimated or predicted by the proposed method. Experimental results show that the performance of travel-time estimation or prediction is comparable to that of some existing methods.

Capacity analysis is key to the planning, construction, and classification of Chinese freeway systems. Incorrect capacity analysis could lead to either an overbuilt freeway system wasting valuable resources or an underbuilt freeway system that cannot meet the demand resulting from rapid economic development. A new method of freeway capacity analysis is presented that links the traffic flow model with highway safety requirements. The capacity derived from this method is theoretically sound and feasible in practice.

Following the emergence of these tools in recent years, interest in the development of more reliable lane-changing models has increased. Lane-changing behavior is also important in several other applications such as capacity analysis and safety studies. Lane-changing behavior is usually modeled in two steps: (a) the decision to consider a lane change, and (b) the decision to execute the lane change. In most models, lane changes are classified as either mandatory (MLC) or discretionary (DLC). MLC are performed when the driver must leave the current lane. DLC are performed to improve driving conditions. Gap acceptance models are used to model the execution of lane changes. The classification of lane changes as either mandatory or discretionary prohibits capturing trade-offs between these considerations. The result is a rigid behavioral structure that does not permit, for example, overtaking when mandatory considerations are active. Using these models within a microsimulator may result in unrealistic traffic flow characteristics. In addition, little empirical work has been done to rigorously estimate the parameters of lane-changing models. An integrated lane-changing model, which allows drivers to jointly consider mandatory and discretionary considerations, is presented. Parameters of the model are estimated with detailed vehicle trajectory data.

Two different univariate [historical average and ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average)] and two multivariate [VARMA (vector autoregressive moving average) and STARIMA (space-time ARIMA)] models are presented and discussed. A comparison of the forecasting performance of these four models is undertaken with data sets from 25 loop detectors located in major arterials in the city of Athens, Greece. The variable under study is the relative velocity, which is the traffic volume divided by the road occupancy. Although the specification of the network's neighborhood structure for the STARIMA model was relatively simple and can be further refined, the results obtained indicate a comparable forecasting performance for the ARIMA, VARMA, and STARIMA models.

These-sensors record certain variables such as speed, flow rate, etc. The values displayed by VMSs thus represent the driving time needed to reach a given destination if road conditions do not change. The whole system provides an Autoregulative Human-Machine Interaction (AHMI) between the vms device (d) and users (u) : if the traffic flow is too high, then drivers might choose alternative routes and the traffic flow should decrease, encouraging in turn drivers to use this route. On the hand, such a se (regulating system includes a model of the user [u]D which is based on suppositions such as : people do not like to waste time, they fully understand the displayed messages, they trust the displayed, values, they are aware of alternative routes. On the other hand, users also have a model of the way vms functions [d]U. For instance, if they do not believe the contents of the message, they will not act as anticipated. Taxonomy Based Modeling was applied to describe drivers' mental models of the vms device. We compiled a set of mental models of the system through interviews (30 participants) using the critical incidents technique (Flanagan, 1954). Results show that the mental models that drivers have of the way the VMS system works are various but not numerous. The interviews, views make it clear that users don't have an adequate model of how the VMS system works and that vms planners have a model of user's behavior that does not correspond to the behavior of the drivers we interviewed. Taxonomy Based Modeling is discussed as a tool for mental model remediation.

Two important components of the simulator were calibrated: driving behavior models and travel behavior components, including origin-destination flows and the route choice model. In the absence of detailed data, only aggregate data (i.e., speed and flow measurements at sensor locations) were available for calibration. Aggregate calibration uses simulation output, which is a result of the inter-action among all components of the simulator. Therefore, it is, in general, impossible to identify the effect of individual models on traffic flow when using aggregate data. The calibration approach used takes these interactions into account by iteratively calibrating the different components to minimize the deviation between observed and simulated measurements. The calibrated MITSIMLab model was validated by comparing observed and simulated measurements: traffic flows at sensor locations, point-to-point travel times, and queue lengths. A second set of measurements, taken a year after the ones used for calibration, was used at this stage. Results of the validation are presented. Practical difficulties and limitations that may arise with application of the calibration and validation approach are discussed.

S	Peters, JM; Jones, AP		Sucharov, LJ; Brebbia, CA		Peters, JM; Jones, AP			The sensitivity of air pollution to the structure and design of cities	URBAN TRANSPORT IX: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	ADVANCES IN TRANSPORT		English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	MAR 10-12, 2003	IRAKLION, GREECE	Wessex Inst Technol			TRAVEL; POPULATION	The importance of urban form in achieving sustainable environments has been recognised in the academic literature for some time. However, there has been rather limited progress in bringing such considerations into the urban systems planning forum. This may, in part, be due to our poor understanding of how large-scale features of urban morphology influence local environmental conditions. For example, the structure of cities, in terms of both their physical and socio-economic layout is likely to control the traffic demand and the resulting traffic flows around the road network. This may be anticipated to lead to spatial variability in the exposure of urban residents to transport associated pollution. However, most modelling work in this area has examined relationships under the constraints of the structure of real cities. As a consequence, the limited understanding we have of the manner by which different urban forms may be associated with total emissions and equity in pollution exposure may be context specific. This research is developing meso-scale urban transport models to examine the relationship between different aspects of urban form and air quality. Drawing upon urban theory, a number of classic forms of the road network are being studied under a range of socio-economic population scenarios. The research shows how vehicle flows and associated emission factors can be modelled under each scenario to determine the way in which aspects of urban structure are related to air pollution. An understanding of the manner by which structural characteristics govern such relationships will be critical if sustainability considerations are to be better incorporated into the urban planning process in the future.

Heavy metal concentrations were examined in fine and coarse particle fractions using a virtual impactor (cut-off size diameter 2.5 mum). Negative vertical concentration gradients were obtained for all metals (Ba, Pb, V, Sb, Zn) and both fractions. It was estimated that the vertical concentration gradient was formed due to emissions from an area of about 12 km(2). Road tunnel measurements indicated that trace metal concentrations on fine particles were lower than those on coarse particles, which suggested that re-emitted road dust was highly enriched in trace metal due to historic emissions within the tunnel. Emission rates of different pollutants in the road tunnel were calculated using pollutant concentration differences at the tunnel entrance and exit and traffic flow data. Heavy metal emission rates from the area of Vilnius city were estimated using the vertical gradient of heavy metal concentrations and the coefficient of turbulent mixing, as derived from meteorological measurement data. The emission values calculated by the two different methods coincided reasonably well, which indicated that the main source of airborne trace metals in Vilnius city is traffic.

More specifically, the macroscopic simulator METANET, involving a second-order traffic flow model as well as network-relevant extensions, is utilized. A rigorous quantitative validation procedure is applied to individual network links, and subsequently a heuristic qualitative validation procedure is employed at a network level. The large-scale motorway network around Amsterdam, The Netherlands, is considered in this investigation. The main goal of the paper is to describe the application approach and procedures and to demonstrate the accuracy and usefulness of macroscopic modeling tools for large-scale motorway networks.

J	El-Araby, K				El-Araby, K			Cross-border traffic management for non-recurrent events in the central European Alpine region	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						traffic management; traffic management plans; cross-border traffic; Alpine traffic; Europe		This article presents a cross-border traffic management framework to overcome problems based on major non-recurrent traffic events such as large-scale road accidents or total road blockages by landslides or extreme weather conditions impacting on traffic flow in the central European Alpine region (i.e., Austria, Bavaria, Northern Italy and Switzerland). The research on which the article is based aims at creating and testing the feasibility of deploying Euro-Regional Traffic Management Plans (TMPs) in case of such incidents to reduce the negative congestion impacts and mitigate disruptions in traffic flow. It adopts an integrated cross-border approach covering strategic and tactical transport management measures within and between the central European Alpine region taking into consideration both the technical and institutional issues involved in cross-border traffic management. The research illustrates the current traffic management situation and the possibilities and prospects for integrated Euro-Regional transport management in the Alpine area using both a scenario-based and model-based approach to develop and validate TMPs. The preliminary results of the study provide a justification for investment by national and European authorities to integrate dislocated transport management measures into regional and Euro-regional transport management strategies. The results show that the approach developed here is applicable for full-scale validation and implementation across other trans-European regions.

J	Wu, N				Wu, N			A new approach for modeling of Fundamental Diagrams	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						fundamental diagram; speed-flow-density relationship; freeway; rural highway		According to the intra-vehicle interaction, a traffic flow can generally be divided into three homogeneous states (1) that of free driving, (2) that of bunched driving, and (3) that of standing. The parameter describing the state of free driving is the desired speed, for the state of bunching it is the intra-vehicle gaps (time headway) within the convoy and the mean speed of the convoy, and for the state of standing it is the maximum jam density. These are the most essential parameters which do not depend on the actual traffic situation. This paper introduces a new model which considers the Fundamental Diagram (equilibrium speed-flow-density relationship) as a function of the homogeneous states. All traffic situations in reality can be considered as combinations of the homogeneous states and therefore can be described by the essential parameters mentioned above. The non-congested (fluid) traffic is a combination (superposition) of the states of free driving and bunched driving, the congested (jam, stop, and go) traffic is a combination of the states of bunched driving (go) and standing (stop). The contribution of the traffic states within the differently congested traffic situations can then be easily obtained from the queuing and probability theory. As a result, Fundamental Diagram in all equilibrium traffic situations is derived as simple functions of the essential parameters. According to the new model the capacity of freeways and rural highways can be determined by measuring the essential parameters. This is much easier than measuring the capacity directly. Furthermore, the probabilities of the various traffic states can be obtained from the new model. This leads to new possibilities in real-time controlling and telematics. The new model is verified by comprehensive measurements carried out on freeways and rural highways in Germany. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kamijo, S; Nishida, T; Sakauchi, M				Kamijo, S; Nishida, T; Sakauchi, M			Occlusion robust and illumination invariant vehicle tracking for acquiring detailed statistics from traffic images	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spatio-Temporal MRF model; tracking; occlusion; illumination invariant; traffic statistics	MODELS; COLOR	Among ITS applications, it is very important to acquire detailed statistics of traffic flows. For that purpose, vision sensors have an advantage because of their rich information compared to such spot sensors such as loop detectors or supersonic wave sensors. However, for many years, vehicle tracking in traffic images has suffered from the problems of occlusion effect and illumination effect. In order to resolve occlusion problems, we have been proposing the Spatio-Temporal Markov Random Field model(S-T MRF) for segmentation of Spatio-Temporal images. This S-T MRF model optimizes the segmentation boundaries of occluded vehicles and their motion vectors simultaneously by referring to textures and segment labeling correlations along the temporal axis as well as the spatial axis. Consequently, S-T MRF has been proven to be successful for vehicle tracking even against severe occlusions found in low-angle traffic images with complicated motions, such at highway junctions. In addition, in this paper, we define a method for obtaining illumination-invariant images by estimating MRF energy among neighbor pixel intensities. These illumination-invariant images are very stable even when sudden variations in illumination or shading effect are occurred in the original images. We then succeeded in seamlessly integrating the method for MRF energy images into our S-T MRF model. Thus, vehicle tracking was performed successfully by S-T MRF, even against sudden variations in illumination and against shading effects. Finally, in order to verify the effectiveness of our tracking algorithm based on the S-T MRF for practical uses, we developed an automated system for acquiring traffic statistics out of a flow of traffic images. This system has been operating continuously for ten months, and thus effectiveness of the tracking algorithm based on S-T MRF model was proven.

J	Sheu, JB				Sheu, JB			A stochastic optimal control approach to real-time, incident-responsive traffic signal control at isolated intersections	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							PREDICTION	Real-time, incident-responsive traffic control and management is vital to development of advanced incident management systems in ITS. More importantly, it provides, from an academic point of view, the linkages between incident detection, incident management, and traffic signal control. This study explores the application of a stochastic optimal control approach to real-time, incident-responsive traffic control at isolated intersections. In the methodology development, time-varying lane traffic state variables and control variables are specified to characterize sectionwide interlane and intralane traffic states under conditions of lane-blocking incidents. Following specification of system states, we formulated a discrete-time nonlinear stochastic model that comprises four types of equations, namely (1) recursive equations, (2) measurement equations, (3) incident-induced delay equations, and (4) boundary constraints. From the proposed stochastic model we then developed a stochastic optimal control algorithm to update the time-varying control variables and lane traffic state variables in real-time with lane-blocking incidents at isolated intersections. To generate traffic data used in model tests efficiently, we employed an advanced microscopic traffic simulator, Paramics, Version 3.0, which is developed to model and analyze ITS traffic flow conditions. The preliminary test results indicate that the proposed method can accomplish the goal of real-time, incident-responsive traffic signal control. In addition to proposing a new methodology, we hope that this study can initiate investigation into real-time, incident-responsive traffic control and management to achieve the final goal of networkwide incident-responsive, traffic-optimal control for incident management.

This version, which is an extension of the Nagatani model, takes into account more realistic conditions in order to examine some interesting aspects of a two-lane roadway The densities of cars in the two-lanes, the mean velocity and the phase diagrams are calculated by computer simulations. We find that in this version the traffic flow is always greater than that of the Nagatani model. Moreover, when the first lane is saturated, the residual mean-velocity is found to be different from zero. We find also that no phase transition occurs in the case where the fraction of cars in the second lane is zero.

J	Darbha, S; Rajagopal, KR				Darbha, S; Rajagopal, KR			Limit of a collection of dynamical systems: An application to modeling the flow of traffic	MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						traffic flow modeling; intelligent transportation systems; spatially discrete traffic flow model; limit of a collection of dynamical systems; aggregation	STABILITY; TIME	The flow of traffic is usually described using a continuum approach as that of a compressible fluid, a statistical approach via the kinetic theory of gases or cellular automata models. These approaches are not suitable for modeling dynamical systems such as traffic. While such systems are large collections, they are not large enough to be treated as a continuum. We provide a rationale for why they cannot be appropriately described using a continuum model, the kinetic theory of gases, or by appealing to cellular automata models. As an alternative, we develop a discrete dynamical systems approach that is particularly well suited to describe the dynamics of large systems such as traffic.

In this review we focus on statistical mechanics and nonequilibrium aspects. It is shown that many properties of traffic flow can be modelled successfully by using rather simple cellular automaton models. Analytical methods for the investigation of discrete models are presented in some detail, Apart from highway traffic, also the modelling of city traffic and pedestrian dynamics will be discussed.

J	Cho, HJ; Lo, SC				Cho, HJ; Lo, SC			Modeling self-consistent multi-class dynamic traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Boltzmann equation; Poisson equation; macroscopic traffic equations; multiclass traffic flow; multilane traffic flow	KINETIC DERIVATION; SIMULATION; WAVES	In this study, we present a systematic self-consistent multiclass multilane traffic model derived from the vehicular Boltzmann equation and the traffic dispersion model. The multilane domain is considered as a two-dimensional space and the interaction among vehicles in the domain is described by a dispersion model. The reason we consider a multilane domain as a two-dimensional space is that the driving behavior of road users may not be restricted by lanes, especially motorcyclists. The dispersion model, which is a nonlinear Poisson equation, is derived from the car-following theory and the equilibrium assumption. Under the concept that all kinds of users share the finite section, the density is distributed on a road by the dispersion model. In addition, the dynamic evolution of the traffic flow is determined by the systematic gas-kinetic model derived from the Boltzmann equation. Multiplying Boltzmann equation by the zeroth, first- and second-order moment functions, integrating both side of the equation and using chain rules, we can derive continuity, motion and variance equation, respectively. However, the second-order moment function, which is the square of the individual velocity, is employed by previous researches does not have physical meaning in traffic flow. Although the second-order expansion results in the velocity variance equation, additional terms may be generated. The velocity variance equation we propose is derived from multiplying Boltzmann equation by the individual velocity variance. It modifies the previous model and presents a new gas-kinetic traffic flow model. By coupling the gas-kinetic model and the dispersion model, a self-consistent system is presented.

J	Huang, DW; Huang, WN				Huang, DW; Huang, WN			The influence of tollbooths on highway traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; FLOW; MODEL	We study the effects of tollbooths on the traffic flow. The highway traffic is simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. Various types of toll collection are examined, which can be characterized either by a waiting time or a reduced speed. A first-order phase transition is observed. The phase separation results a saturated flow, which is observed as a plateau region in the fundamental diagram. The effects of lane expansion near the tollbooth are examined. The full capacity of a highway can be restored. The emergence of vehicle queuing is studied. Besides the numerical results, we also obtain analytical expressions for various quantities. The numerical simulations can be well described by the analytical formulas. We also discuss the influence on the travel time and its variance. The tollbooth increases the travel time but decreases its variance. The differences between long- and short-distance travelers are also discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Martin, JL				Martin, JL			Relationship between crash rate and hourly traffic flow on interurban motorways	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						hourly traffic flow; incidence rate; interurban motorway; modeling; negative-binomial regression; relationship road accident; severity	ACCIDENTS; POISSON	This paper describes the relationship between crash incidence rates and hourly traffic volume and discusses the influence of traffic on crash severity, based on observations made on 2000 kin of French interurban motorways over 2 years. Incidence rates involving property damage-only crashes and injury-crashes are highest when traffic is lightest (under 400 vehicles/h). These incidence rates are at their lowest when traffic flows at a rate of 1000-1500 vehicles/h. For heavier traffic flows, crash incidence rates increase steadily as traffic increases on 2- and 3-lane motorways and inflect on 2-lane motorways when traffic increases to a level of 3000 vehicles/h. For an equivalent light traffic level, the number of crashes is higher on three-lane than on 2-lane motorways and higher at weekends (when truck traffic is restricted) than on weekdays. In heavy traffic, the number of crashes is higher on weekdays. We found no significant difference between the number of daytime and night-time crashes, whatever the traffic. No difference was observed in crash severity by number of lanes or period in the week for a given level of traffic. However, severity is greater at night and when hourly traffic is light. Compared to the number of vehicles on the road, light traffic is a safety problem in terms of frequency and severity, and road safety campaigns targeting motorway users to influence their behavior in these driving conditions should be introduced.

The mass concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) were measured simultaneously at distances of 12, 25, 52 and 87 m from the centre of a major road at a height of 1.8 m, using identical samplers. The concentration measurements were conducted during 16 daytime hours (from 6.00 a.m. to 10.00 p.m.) for 27 days. Traffic flows and relevant meteorological parameters were measured on-site; meteorological measurements from a nearby synoptic weather station were also utilised. We also suggest a preliminary model for predicting the concentrations Of PM2.5 and apply this model in order to analyse the measured data. The regionally and long-range transported contribution was evaluated on the basis of a semi-empirical mathematical model utilising as input values the daily sulphate, nitrate and ammonium measurements at the EMEP stations (Co-operative programme for monitoring and evaluation of the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe). The influence of primary vehicular emissions from the nearest roads was evaluated using a roadside emission and dispersion model, CAR-FMI, in combination with a meteorological pre-processing model, MPP-FMI. The contribution of non-exhaust particulate matter emissions (including resuspension of particulate matter from road surfaces) was estimated simply to be directly proportional to the concentrations originating from primary vehicular emissions. Comparison of the predicted results and measurements yields information on the relative importance of various source categories of the measured concentrations Of PM2.5. The regionally and long-range transported contribution, the primary and non-exhaust vehicular emissions, and other sources were estimated to contribute on average 41 +/- 6%, 33 +/- 6% and 26 +/- 7% of the observed PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The model presented could also be applied in other European cities for analysing the source contributions to measured fine particulate matter concentrations. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Zhu, YF; Hinds, WC; Kim, S; Shen, S; Sioutas, C				Zhu, YF; Hinds, WC; Kim, S; Shen, S; Sioutas, C			Study of ultrafine particles near a major highway with heavy-duty diesel traffic	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						ultrafine particles; freeways; diesel; carbon monoxide; black carbon	AIRBORNE PARTICULATE MATTER; AIR-POLLUTION; SUBMICROMETER PARTICLES; HEALTH; NANOPARTICLES; GENERATION; MORTALITY; EMISSION; IRON; MASS	Motor vehicle emissions usually constitute the most significant source of ultrafine particles (diameter < 0.1 pm) in an urban environment. Zhu et al. (J. Air Waste Manage. Assoc., 2002, accepted for publication) conducted systematic measurements of the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of a highway dominated by gasoline vehicle. The present study compares these previous measurements with those made on Interstate 710 freeway in Los Angeles. The 710 freeway was selected because more than 25% of the vehicles are heavy-duty diesel trucks. Particle number concentration and size distribution in the size range from 6 to 220 nm were measured by a condensation particle counter and a scanning mobility particle sizer, respectively. Measurements were taken at 17, 20, 30, 90, 150, and 300 m downwind and 200 m upwind from the center of the freeway. At each sampling location, concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and black carbon (BC) were also measured by a Dasibi CO monitor and an Aethalometer, respectively. The range of average concentration of CO, BC and total particle number concentration at 17 m was 1.9-2.6 ppm, 20.3-24.8 mug/m(3), 1.8 x 10(5)-3.5 x 10(5)/cm(3), respectively. Relative concentration of CO, BC and particle number decreased exponentially and tracked each other well as one moves away from the freeway. Both atmospheric dispersion and coagulation appears to contribute to the rapid decrease in particle number concentration and change in particle size distribution with increasing distance from the freeway. Average traffic flow during the sampling periods was 12,180 vehicles/h with more than 25% of vehicles being heavy-duty diesel trucks.

J	Rajamani, R; Zhu, C				Rajamani, R; Zhu, C			Semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control systems	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						adaptive cruise control; inter-vehicle communication; vehicle control	VEHICLES	The concept of a semi-autonomous adaptive cruise control (SAACC) system is developed, which enjoys significant advantages over present day adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems in terms of highway safety and traffic flow capacity. The semi-autonomous systems combine the deployment advantages of autonomous vehicles with the performance advantages of fully automated highway systems (AHSs) in which vehicles operate cooperatively as a platoon. Unlike platoon systems, the semi-autonomous systems will be immediately deployable on present day highways, where both manually driven and adaptive cruise controlled vehicles can coexist. The theoretical results in this paper show that the proposed system would be able to safely maintain smaller time gaps, would be string stable, and would be guaranteed to have smaller actuator inputs than a standard autonomous ACC system. The simulation results in the paper indicate that more accurate and smoother tracking, smaller time gaps, smaller control efforts, and increased robustness to vehicle dynamics are achieved by semi-autonomous control.

J	Zhu, YF; Hinds, WC; Kim, S; Sioutas, C				Zhu, YF; Hinds, WC; Kim, S; Sioutas, C			Concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles near a major highway	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							AIR-POLLUTION; SUBMICROMETER PARTICLES; AEROSOLS; NANOPARTICLES; DEPOSITION; MORTALITY; EMISSION; HEALTH; MASS	Motor vehicle emissions usually constitute the most significant source of ultrafine particles (diameter <0.1 mum) in an urban environment, yet little is known about the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways. In the present study, particle number concentration and size distribution in the size range from 6 to 220 nm were measured by a condensation particle counter (CPC) and a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), respectively. Measurements were taken 30, 60, 90, 150, and 300 m downwind, and 300 m upwind, from Interstate 405 at the Los Angeles National Cemetery. At each sampling location, concentrations of CO, black carbon (BC), and particle mass were also measured by a Dasibi CO monitor, an aethalometer, and a DataRam, respectively. The range of average concentration of CO, BC, total particle number, and mass concentration at 30 in was 1.7-2.2 ppm, 3.4-10.0 mug/m(3),1.3-2.0 x 10(5)/cm(3), and 30.2-64.6 mug/m(3), respectively. For the conditions of these measurements, relative concentrations of CO, BC, and particle number tracked each other well as distance from the freeway increased. Particle number concentration (6-220 nm) decreased exponentially with downwind distance from the freeway. Data showed that both atmospheric dispersion and coagulation contributed to the rapid decrease in particle number concentration and change in particle size distribution with increasing distance from the freeway. Average traffic flow during the sampling periods was 13,900 vehicles/hr. Ninety-three percent of vehicles were gasoline-powered cars or light trucks. The measured number concentration tracked traffic flow well. Thirty meters downwind from the freeway, three distinct ultrafine modes were observed with geometric mean diameters of 13, 27, and 65 nm. The smallest mode, with a peak concentration of 1.6 x 10(5)/cm(3), disappeared at distances greater than 90 in from the freeway. Ultrafine particle number concentration measured 300 m downwind from the freeway was indistinguishable from upwind background concentration. These data may be used to estimate exposure to ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways.

Congestion occurs at the upper stream of a traffic blockade, Nihonzaka tunnel, in contrast to preceding observations at the upper stream of an on-ramp. The flow on the fast lane is congested more severely than on the slow lane. The flow on the fast lane, however, almost always exceeds the one on the slow lane. The observed congested flow is stable and the average velocity on both lanes strongly correlated.

J	Sasoh, A; Ohara, T				Sasoh, A; Ohara, T			Shock wave relation containing lane change source term for two-lane traffic flow	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						shock waves; traffic flow; lane change; source term; continuity equation; shock polar	MODEL	The shock wave relation for two-lane traffic flow with lane changes has been formulated. The post-shock condition is obtained by adding a source term which accounts for the lane changes to the continuity equation. The shock velocity, and the corresponding post-shock conditions are obtained from matching relation between the lanes. The source term is affected by the transverse velocity for the lane change. If the lane to which cars intend to change is not crowded and lane change is permitted without restriction, the source term linearly increases with increasing the transverse velocity. However, if the lane change motion is limited due to crowded traffic, the lane change rate is decreased; the traffic flow gets involved in more complicated shock wave dynamics. In any case, shock polar analysis eases the derivation and the comprehension of the matched shock relation.

J	Hagring, O				Hagring, O			Estimation of parameters in distribution of headways in roundabouts	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						parameters; traffic flow; intersections; highway design		Estimation of parameters in the distribution of headways in roundabouts is a cumbersome task. Inherent to data employed are temporal variation together with dependence between successive vehicles. This is a consequence of the sampling period and interactions in the roundabouts. The elimination of observations, so as to obtain trend-free samples of independent vehicles, removes too much information from the data. If all the observations are used, the results of the parameter estimations are affected by temporal variation and dependence between headways. In this paper, an analysis of the statistical properties of the headways between major stream vehicles in roundabouts is described. The properties investigated were the existence of temporal variation in the measured headways and independent and identically distributed successive headways, i.e., if the headways were from a random sample. More than 50% of the investigated subsets suffered from trends or other nonrandom variations. The question whether these subsets should be excluded or not is discussed. Three methods for the estimation of parameters in the M3 distribution were tested. For the two-lane subsets, it was possible to demonstrate a linear relationship between the proportion of free vehicles and the volume. For the one-lane subsets, the adjusted R-2 was low, and the linear constant was not significant. Nevertheless, the distributions estimated by use of the two-lane subsets did not provide a better fit to the observed data than the distributions estimated by the use of one-lane subsets. The predicted capacity for a minor lane, i.e., the capacity obtained by the fitted distribution, was close to the capacity obtained by the empirical distribution function (the estimated capacity).

J	Abu-Lebdeh, G				Abu-Lebdeh, G			Integrated adaptive-signal dynamic-speed control of signalized arterials	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; traffic signals; traffic speed; integrated systems		This paper demonstrates the feasibility of an advanced concept of traffic control for congested urban arterials in an intelligent transportation system (ITS) setting. The core idea of the new concept is to integrate the capability of dynamic adaptive signals with dynamically optimized time-dependent variable speed. Under such control, speeds would be automatically optimized and set by a central computer in parallel with the other signal control parameters. Speed and signal control parameters would change between links and over time, in response to changing traffic conditions. Drivers would follow the optimized speed as they enter a link. Once an optimal speed has been set for a link, it remains constant until the control cycle ends, Link speeds would be updated only at the end of every control cycle. The control cycle may change in length as system conditions evolve. The new control concept was tested on a congested arterial with multiple links. The arterial system was modeled as a discrete event time varying dynamic system with a control period spanning several cycles. System throughput was maximized subject to such critical operational measures as intersection blockage, queue spillbacks, and other relevant traffic operation measures. Genetic algorithms were used as an optimization tool. Results show that the proposed control concept will significantly improve traffic flow. The new control concept is suitable for on-line implementation in an ITS setting.

J	De Lotto, R; Ferrara, A				De Lotto, R; Ferrara, A			A transportation network model as a tool to solve urban planning location problems	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						transportation networks; location problems; large scale systems models; urban planning		The aim of this paper is to formulate a transportation network model conceived as a basis of possible tools to be used by administrators and planners to approach location problems in a urban context. The key element of this model is a static representation of the transportation network, made of oriented links and nodes, connecting the facilities located in a prespecified urban area. Such a representation is based on an analogy of electric nature, thus allowing to exploit conventional electric networks solvers to determine the relevant features of the traffic flow in each link of the transportation network. The facility quality level is also taken into account in a quantitative fashion. Relying on the proposed model, different related results, such as the minimum path matrix and the induced traffic in each link of the network can be retrieved.

J	Ha, MS; den Nijs, M				Ha, MS; den Nijs, M			Macroscopic car condensation in a parking garage	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL; ELECTRONIC TRANSPORT; BALLISTIC DEPOSITION; TRAFFIC FLOW; FLUCTUATIONS; SYSTEMS	An asymmetric exclusion process type process, where cars move forward along a closed road that starts and terminates at a parking garage, displays dynamic phase transitions into two types of condensate phases where the garage becomes macroscopically occupied. The total car density rho(o) and the exit probability alpha from the garage are the two control parameters. At the transition, the number of parked cars N-p diverges in both cases, with the length of the road N-s, as N(p)similar toN(s)(p)(y) with y(p)=1/2. Towards the transition, the number of parked cars vanishes as N(p)similar toepsilon(beta) with beta=1, epsilon=\alpha-alpha*\ or epsilon=\rho(o)*-rho(o)\ being the distance from the transition. The transition into the normal phase represents also the onset of transmission of information through the garage. This gives rise to unusual parked car autocorrelations and car density profiles near the garage, which depend strongly on the group velocity of the fluctuations along the road.

Different from previous works, we consider not only the influence of the on-ramp flow on the main road but also the opposite influence.

J	Wang, RL; Ruskin, HJ				Wang, RL; Ruskin, HJ			Modeling traffic flow at a single-lane urban roundabout	COMPUTER PHYSICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Europhysics Conference on Computational Physics (CCP 2001)	SEP 05-08, 2001	AACHEN, GERMANY			roundabout; cellular automata; throughput; traffic flow; modeling; driver behavior		In this paper, we propose a new model to study traffic flow at a single-lane urban roundabout, using a multi-state cellular automata (CA) ring under the offside-priority rule (by which a vehicle entering gives way to one already on the roundabout). Each vehicle entering the roundabout is randomly characterized by a predetermined exit with specified probability. Driver behavior at the roundabout entrance is randomly grouped into four categories based on space required to enter the roundabout. Three aspects of roundabout performance in particular have been studied. The first looks at overall throughput (the number of vehicles that navigate the roundabout in a given time). This is considered for different geometries, turning and arrival rates (vehicles arrive at random with a Poisson distribution, with parameter lambda less than or equal to 0.5 in general for free flow). The second investigates changes in queue length, delay time and vehicle density (ratio of the number vehicles to the number of cells) for an individual road. The third considers the impact of driver choices on throughput and operation of the roundabout. We find that throughput is influenced by the topology of the roundabout and turning rates, but only incidentally by size. Throughput reaches a maximum for critical arrival rate on one or more roads. Driver behavior has considerable impact on overall performance, with rapid congestion resulting from reckless choices. Vehicles drive on the left in Ireland, but rules are generally applicable.

The model is a system of nonlinear hyperbolic equations with both relaxation and sources. The flux and the source terms depend on the space variable. Waves for such a system propagate in a more complicated way than those do for models with homogeneous road conditions. The L-1 well-posedness theory for the model is established. In particular, we derive the continuous dependence of the solution on its initial data in L, topology. Moreover, the L-1-convergence to the unique zero relaxation limit is proved. Finally, the asymptotic states of a general solution whose initial data tend to constant states as \x\ --> +infinity are constructed.

J	To, WM; Ip, RCW; Lam, GCK; Yau, CTH				To, WM; Ip, RCW; Lam, GCK; Yau, CTH			A multiple regression model for urban traffic noise in Hong Kong	JOURNAL OF THE ACOUSTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA			English	Article								This article describes the roadside traffic noise surveys conducted in heavily built-up urban areas in Hong Kong. Noise measurements were carried out along 18 major roads in 1999. The measurement data included L-10, L-50, L-90, L-eq, L-max, the number of light vehicles, the number of heavy vehicles, the total traffic flow, and the average speed of vehicles. Statistical analysis using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test (p<0.05) reveals that the total traffic flow and the number of heavy vehicles are the most significant factors of urban traffic noise. Multiple regression was used to derive a set of empirical formulas for predicting L-10 noise level due to road traffic. The accuracy of these empirical formulas is, quantified and compared to that of another widely used prediction model in Hong Kong-the Calculation of Road Traffic Noise. The applicability of the selected multiple regression model is validated by the noise measurements performed in the winter of 2000. (C) 2002 Acoustical Society of America.

J	Hazelton, ML				Hazelton, ML			Day-to-day variation in Markovian traffic assignment models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						asymptotic; coefficient of reactivity; dynamics; learning mechanisms; route choice	TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS; EQUILIBRIUM	Markovian traffic assignment processes form an intuitively attractive and flexible class of models. However, the intrinsic complexity of these models (especially when applied to large road networks) make their theoretical analysis very difficult. Simulation of the process in question can be used to learn something of the characteristics of the assignment model, but such simulation is typically computationally expensive. Furthermore, interpretation of simulation results is often far from straightforward. For example, it is difficult to discover to what extent day-to-day variability in traffic flows can be attributed to travellers' reactions to changing mean travel costs, and to what extent these variations are simply explained by entirely haphazard fluctuations in individual travellers' preferences. Nonetheless, this is an important issue, not least because it is crucial in understanding how a Markovian assignment process will react to various types of one-off event,T (such as the temporary closure of a road link). In this paper a new analytical tool called the coefficient of reactivity is introduced. This coefficient summarises the extent to which traveller learning mechanisms provoke day-to-day volatility in Markovian assignment models. Properties of the coefficient of reactivity, and its more easily calculated asymptotic form, are discussed. Uses and interpretations of these new coefficients are illustrated through a number of examples. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, PY; Shrivastava, A				Li, PY; Shrivastava, A			Traffic flow stability induced by constant time headway policy for adaptive cruise control vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic flow; stability; adaptive cruise control; macroscopic model; headway; biasing strategy	AUTOMATED HIGHWAY SYSTEMS; CONTROL LAWS	This paper is concerned with the traffic flow stability/instability induced by a particular adaptive cruise control (ACC) policy, known as the "constant time headway (CTH) policy". The control policy is analyzed for a circular highway using three different traffic models, namely a microscopic model, a spatially discrete model, and a spatially continuous model. It is shown that these three different modeling paradigms can result in different traffic stability properties unless the control policy and traffic dynamics are consistently abstracted for the different paradigms. The traffic dynamics will, however, be qualitatively consistent across the three modeling paradigms if a consistent biasing strategy is used to adapt the CTH policy to the various modeling frameworks. The biasing strategy determines whether the feedback quantity for use in the control, is taken colocatedly, downstream or upstream to the vehicle/section/highway location. For ACC vehicles equipped with forward looking sensors, the downstream biasing strategy should be used. In this case, the CTH policy induces exponentially stable traffic flow on a circular highway in all three modeling frameworks. It is also shown that traffic flow stability will be preserved for an open stretch highway if the entry and exit conditions are made to observe the downstream biasing strategy.

J	Smith, BL; Williams, BM; Oswald, RK				Smith, BL; Williams, BM; Oswald, RK			Comparison of parametric and nonparametric models for traffic flow forecasting	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic forecasting; nonparametric regression; ARIMA models; motorway flows; short-term traffic prediction; statistical forecasting		Single point short-term traffic flow forecasting will play a key role in supporting demand forecasts needed by operational network models. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), a classic parametric modeling approach to time series, and nonparametric regression models have been proposed as well suited for application to single point short-term traffic flow forecasting. Past research has shown seasonal ARIMA models to deliver results that are statistically superior to basic implementations of nonparametric regression. However, the advantages associated with a data-driven nonparametric forecasting approach motivate further investigation of refined nonparametric forecasting methods. Following this motivation, this research effort seeks to examine the theoretical foundation of nonparametric regression and to answer the question of whether nonparametric regression based on heuristically improved forecast generation methods approach the single interval traffic flow prediction performance of seasonal ARIMA models.

The measurements were made from the top of a tower, approximately 65 m above the street level of Edinburgh, Scotland, and the fluxes are representative of footprint source areas of several square kilometers. The application of a stationarity test and spectral analysis techniques shows that, at this height, the stationarity criterion for eddy covariance is fulfilled for wind directions from the city center for 93% of the time, while for other wind directions this declines to 59%, demonstrating that pollutant fluxes from urban areas can be measured. The average CO2 emission from the city center was 26 mumol m(-2) s(-1) (10 kt of C km(-2) yr(-1)), with typical daytime peaks of 5075 and nighttime values of 10 mumol m(-2) s(-1). The correlation between CO2 emission and traffic flow is highly significant, while residential and institutional heating with natural gas are estimated to contribute about 39% to the emissions during the day and 64% at night. An analysis of the energy budget shows that, during the autumn, fossil fuel combustion within the city contributed one-third of the daily anthropogenic energy input of 3.8 MJ m(-2) d(-1), with the remainder coming from other energy sources, dominated by electricity, Conversely, the total energy input in late spring (May/June) was found to be approximately half this value.

Changes in path loss, traffic conditions; and LOS-blocking caused by vehicles were measured simultaneously. It was found that path loss exhibits a Rayleigh distribution even in a LOS environment if the amount of traffic is such that LOS- blocking occurs for 80% of the time or more, but the other case path loss exhibits a Nakagami-Rice distribution. It was also found that ratio of coherent wave level to envelope level (c/r) depends heavily on rate of road traffic flow.

J	Lubashevsky, I; Mahnke, R; Wagner, P; Kalenkov, S				Lubashevsky, I; Mahnke, R; Wagner, P; Kalenkov, S			Long-lived states in synchronized traffic flow: Empirical prompt and dynamical trap model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-DIAGRAM; SIMULATION; TRANSITIONS; WAVES	The present paper proposes an interpretation of the widely scattered states (called synchronized traffic) stimulated by Kerner's hypothesis about the existence of a multitude of metastable states in the fundamental diagram. Using single-vehicle data collected at the German highway A1, temporal velocity patterns have been analyzed to show a collection of certain fragments with approximately constant velocities and sharp jumps between them. The particular velocity values in these fragments vary in a wide range. In contrast, the flow rate is more or less constant because its fluctuations are mainly due to the discreteness of traffic flow. Subsequently, we develop a model for synchronized traffic that can explain these characteristics. Following previous work [I. A. Lubashevsky and R. Mahnke, Phys. Rev. E 62, 6082 (2000)] the vehicle flow is specified by car density, mean velocity, and additional order parameters h and a that are due to the many-particle effects of the vehicle interaction. The parameter h describes the multilane correlations in the vehicle motion. Together with the car density it determines directly the mean velocity. The parameter a, in contrast, controls the evolution of h only. The model assumes that a fluctuates randomly around the value corresponding to the car configuration optimal for lane changing. When it deviates from this value the lane change is depressed for all cars forming a local cluster. Since exactly the overtaking maneuvers of these cars cause the order parameter a to vary, the evolution of the car arrangement becomes frozen for a certain time. In other words, the evolution equations form certain dynamical traps responsible for the long-time correlations in the synchronized mode.

J	Yang, H; Tang, WH; Cheung, WM; Meng, Q				Yang, H; Tang, WH; Cheung, WM; Meng, Q			Profitability and welfare gain of private toll roads in a network with heterogeneous users	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						private roads; road pricing; network equilibrium; value of time; profitability; welfare gain	BICRITERION TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; COST; EQUILIBRIUM; LINK	The recent worldwide tendency towards the introduction of commercially and privately provided roads proves to be efficient for building and operating road systems. One of the important issues concerning development of a private toll road is the selection of its capacity and toll charge and the evaluation of the relevant benefits to the private investor, the road users and the whole society. Yang and Meng [Transportation Research 34A (2000)] have recently examined this critical issue in a road network context. An important limitation in their analysis is that a single (average) value of time (VOT) for all road users is assumed in the network equilibrium model for traffic forecasts. It is a fact that each user has a different VOT, depending on how much money or time he or she is willing or able to spend on a particular trip. This paper relaxes the earlier single VOT assumption using a multi-class network equilibrium model. The entire population of users is segmented into a number of groups or classes according to their VOT, and trip rates by different groups are characterized by distinct group-specific demand functions. Users are assumed to minimize their individual generalized trip cost, and thus divide themselves among the various alternative routes that are differentiated on the basis of travel time and monetary cost. With the explicit consideration of user heterogeneity, we investigate the various possibilities of profitability and welfare gain of a private toll road in a given network under various combinations of road capacity and toll charge. In particular, we compare and contrast the outcomes with the case of a single average VOT, and investigate how VOT distribution affects traffic flow and profit forecasts of private toll roads.

J	Sheu, HB				Sheu, HB			A fuzzy clustering-based approach to automatic freeway incident detection and characterization	FUZZY SETS AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						fuzzy clustering; pattern recognition; automatic incident detection and characterization	CONGESTION; PREDICTION; LANE	Automatic incident detection and characterization is urgently required in the development of advanced technologies used for reducing non-recurrent traffic congestion on freeways. This paper presents a new method which is constructed primarily on the basis of the fuzzy clustering theories to identify automatically freeway incidents. The proposed approach is capable of distinguishing the time-varying patterns of incident-induced traffic states from the patterns of incident-free traffic states, and characterizing incidents with respect to the onset and end time steps of incidents, incident location, the temporal and spatial change patterns of incident-related traffic variables in response to the impacts of incidents on freeway traffic flows in real time. Lane traffic count and density are the two major types of input data, which can be readily collected from point detectors. Based on the spatial and temporal relationships of the collected raw traffic data, several time-varying state variables are defined, and then evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively to determine the decision variables used for real-time incident characterization. Utilizing the specified decision variables, the proposed fuzzy clustering-based algorithm executes recurrently three major procedures: (1) identification of traffic flow conditions, (2) recognition of incident occurrence, and (3) incident characterization. In this study, data used for model tests are generated from the CORSIM traffic simulator. Our preliminary test results indicate that the proposed approach is promising, and, in expectation, can be integrated with any published real-time incident detection technologies. Importantly, this study may contribute significantly to the applications of fuzzy clustering techniques, and stimulate more related research. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Ghamdi, AS				Al-Ghamdi, AS			Analysis of time headways on urban roads	CIVIL ENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						traffic flow; headways; chi-square test; arterials		The headway between vehicles in a traffic stream is of fundamental importance in traffic engineering applications. Previous research in this subject has focused on modeling theoretical distributions for low and medium traffic flow conditions. Yet little research has studied congested traffic conditions, that is, the high traffic flow state. In the same context, there appears to be a lack of clear-cut boundaries for the three flow states (low, medium, and high). This study attempts to determine such boundaries on the basis of traffic conditions observed at the study sites. Although observed headways at arterial sites follow a gamma distribution, distributions that fit freeway headways differ according to the traffic flow state. The Erlang distribution provided a good fit to the observed headways at sites with high traffic flows.

The term emergency vehicles is used in a general sense to describe vehicles, such as police cars, ambulances, and tow trucks, that may service faults inside or outside the AHS. The transit of emergency vehicles requires intensive participation of the coordination layer, which directs the interactions of neighboring vehicles, and the link layer, which regulates traffic flow along stretches of highway. Various strategies for these two hierarchical layers that are needed to assign high-priority transit to emergency vehicles (EVs) on the AHS are described. These coordination and link layer maneuvers circulate vehicles around the EV in both free-flowing and stopped traffic.

Using numerical simulations of a recent stochastic car-following model we show that this strategy yields optimization of traffic flow when implemented in systems with a localized periodic inhomogeneity, such as signalized intersections and entry ramps. The optimization process is explained by our finding of a generalized fundamental diagram (GFD) for traffic, namely a flux-density-wavelength relation. Projecting the GFD on the density-flux plane yields a two-dimensional region of stable states, qualitatively similar to that found empirically [Kerner, Phys. Rev.

J	Jiang, R; Wu, QS; Zhu, ZJ				Jiang, R; Wu, QS; Zhu, ZJ			A new continuum model for traffic flow and numerical tests	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						traffic flow; continuum model; characteristic speed; car-following	STABILITY	A new continuum traffic flow model is developed in this paper based on an improved car-following model. In this new continuum model, the speed gradient replaces the density gradient in the equation of motion, and this replacement guarantees the property that the characteristic speeds are always less than or equal to the macroscopic flow speed. This new model also overcomes the backward travel problem that exists in many high-order continuum models. Shock waves, rarefaction waves, stop-and-go waves, and local cluster effects can be obtained from this new model and are consistent with the diverse nonlinear dynamical phenomena observed in the freeway traffic.

The main objective was to evaluate the spatial and temporal variation of average exposure of the urban population to ambient air pollution in different microenvironments with reasonable accuracy, instead of analysing in detail personal exposures for specific individuals. We have utilised a previously developed modelling system for predicting the traffic flows and emissions, emissions originating from stationary sources, and atmospheric dispersion of pollution in an urban area. A model was developed for combining the predicted concentrations, information on people's activities (such as the time spent at home, in the workplace and at other places of activity during the day) and location of the population. Time-microenvironment activity data for the working-age population was obtained from the EXPOLIS study (air pollution distributions within adult urban populations in Europe). Information on the location of homes and workplaces was obtained from local municipalities. The concentrations of NO2 were modelled over the Helsinki Metropolitan Area for 1996 and 1997. The computed results were processed and visualised using the geographical information system (GIS) MapInfo. The utilisation of the modelling system has been illustrated by presenting numerical results for the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. The results show the spatial and temporal (diurnal) variation of the ambient air NO2 concentrations, the population density and the corresponding average exposure. The model developed has been designed to be utilised by municipal authorities in urban planning, e.g., for evaluating the impacts of traffic planning and land use scenarios.

A traffic-flow simulation was developed and mapped onto a parallel computer architecture. Two algorithms (the one-step and two-step algorithms) to solve the simulation equations were developed and implemented. Tests with real traffic data collected from the freeway network in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis, MN, were used to validate the accuracy and computation rate of the parallel simulation system (with 256 processors). The execution time for a 24-h traffic-flow simulation over a 15.5-mi freeway, which takes 65.7 min on a typical single-processor computer, took only 88.51 s on the nCUBE2 and only 2.39 s on the CRAY T3E. The two-step algorithm, whose goal is to trade off extra computation for fewer interprocessor communications, was shown to save significantly on the communication time on both parallel computers.

J	Nevers, BL; Rouphail, NM				Nevers, BL; Rouphail, NM			Field evaluation of lane selection strategies at signalized intersections	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						intersections; traffic signals; traffic characteristics; traffic flown; evaluation		A critical element in assessing traffic performance at the individual lane level at signalized intersections is the knowledge of traffic volumes in each lane. Typically, turning movement volumes are available only for the entire approach, not for each individual lane. Collecting turning movement volumes by lane is costly and, for future year analyses, is unattainable. This paper summarizes the results of an empirical study of lane volume data that were collected at three intersections and provides an evaluation of six lane selection strategies used to estimate lane flows. The lane selection strategies are used as part of the subgroup approach for estimating saturation flow. This limited evaluation indicates that a lane selection strategy based on equal back of queue or cycle-average queue provides the best prediction of individual lane volumes in the field. This result is intriguing given that at least three international capacity guides currently use an equal flow ratio or degree of saturation strategy for estimating lane How and indicates a need for a larger data collection effort to confirm the results of this study.

J	Karim, A; Adeli, H				Karim, A; Adeli, H			Incident detection algorithm using wavelet energy representation of traffic patterns	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic management; traffic accidents; algorithms; highways	NETWORKS	Automatic freeway incident detection is an important component of advanced transportation management systems (ATMS) that provides information for emergency relief and traffic control and management purposes. Earlier algorithms for freeway incident problems have produced less reliable results, especially in recurrent congestion and compression wave traffic conditions. This article presents a new two-stage single-station freeway incident detection model based on advanced wavelet analysis and pattern recognition techniques. Wavelet analysis is used to denoise, cluster, and enhance the raw traffic data, which is then classified by a radial basis function neural network. An energy representation of the traffic pattern in the wavelet domain is found to best characterize incident and nonincident traffic conditions. False alarm during recurrent congestion and compression waves is eliminated by normalization of a sufficiently long time-series pattern. The model is tested under several traffic flow scenarios including compression wave conditions. It produced excellent detection and false alarms characteristics. The model is computationally efficient and can readily be implemented online in any ATMS without any need for recalibration.

J	Coifman, B				Coifman, B			Estimating travel times and vehicle trajectories on freeways using dual loop detectors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						traffic surveillance; loop detectors; travel time estimation; vehicle trajectories		Recent research has investigated various means of measuring link travel times on freeways. This search has been motivated in part by the fact that travel time is considered to be more informative to users than local velocity measurements at a detector station. But direct travel time measurement requires the correlation of vehicle observations at multiple locations, which in turn requires new communications infrastructure and/or new detector hardware. This paper presents a method for estimating link travel time using data from an individual dual loop detector, without requiring any new hardware. The estimation technique exploits basic traffic flow theory to extrapolate local conditions to an extended link. In the process of estimating travel times, the algorithm also estimates vehicle trajectories. The work demonstrates that the travel time estimates are very good provided there are no sources of delay, such as an incident, within a link. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Watling, D				Watling, D			A second order stochastic network equilibrium model, II: Solution method and numerical experiments	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS	Real traffic networks typically exhibit considerable day-to-day variations in traffic flows and travel times, yet these variations are commonly neglected in network performance models. Recently, two alternative theoretical approaches were proposed for incorporating stochastic flow variation in the equilibration of route choices: the stochastic process (SP) approach (Cantarella and Cascetta 1995) and the second order generalized stochastic user equilibrium (GSUE(2)) model (Watling 2002). The theoretical basis of the two approaches is contrasted, and the paper goes on to present a heuristic solution method for the GSUE(2) model, and two alternative simulation methods for the SP model, each applicable to the realistic case of probit-based choice probabilities. These solution methods are then applied to two realistic networks. Factors affecting convergence and reproducibility are first identified, followed by comparisons of the GSUE(2) and SP predictions. It is seen that a quasi-periodic behaviour commonly arises in the SP model, with the predictions radically different from the GSUE(2) model. However, by modifying the link performance functions in the overcapacity regime, the nature of the SP solution changes, and for a memory filter based on a large number of days' experience, its moments are seen to be approximated by those of the GSUE(2) model. Implications for the application of these models are discussed.

The analysis focuses on the reproduction of the lane usage inversion and the density dependence of the number of lane changes. It is shown that the single-lane dynamics can be extended to the two-lane case without changing the basic properties of the model, which are known to be in good agreement with empirical single-vehicle data. Therefore it is possible to reproduce various empirically observed two-lane phenomena, like the synchronization of the lanes, without fine tuning of the model parameters.

This model was based on the idea of the car-following model, which claims that the motion of a vehicle at one time step depends on both its headway and the synchronous motion of the front vehicle, thus including indirectly the influence of its sub-neighboring vehicle. It? addition, the so-called safety distance was introduced to consider the deceleration behavior of vehicles and the stochastic factor was taken into account by introducing the deceleration probability. Meanwhile, the conditional deceleration in the model gives a better description of the phenomena observed on highways. It is found that there exists the metastability and hysteresis effect of traffic flow in the neighborhood of critical density under different initial conditions. Since this model gives a reasonable depiction of the motion of a single vehicle, it is easy to be extended to the case of traffic flow tinder the control of traffic lights in cities.

The highway traffic is provided by a hydrodynamical model. We analyze the characteristics of perturbations to induce congestion near on ramp. The phase boundary is obtained. A scaling relation is revealed. We also analyze the time evolution of the local density profile. Conventional control mechanisms to regulate the on-ramp flow are examined.

J	Yin, HB; Wong, SC; Xu, JM; Wong, CK				Yin, HB; Wong, SC; Xu, JM; Wong, CK			Urban traffic flow prediction using a fuzzy-neural approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic flow prediction; urban traffic control system; fuzzy-neural model; online rolling training procedure; time series forecasting		This paper develops a fuzzy-neural model (FNM) to predict the traffic flows in an urban street network, which has long been considered a major element in the responsive urban traffic control systems. The FNM consists of two modules: a gate network (GN) and an expert network (EN). The GN classifies the input data into a number of clusters using a fuzzy approach, and the EN specifies the input-output relationship as in a conventional neural network approach. While the GN groups traffic patterns of similar characteristics into clusters, the EN models the specific relationship within each cluster. An online rolling training procedure is proposed to train the FNM, which enhances its predictive power through adaptive adjustments of the model coefficients in response to the real-time traffic conditions. Both simulation and real observation data are used to demonstrative the effectiveness of the method. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

These profiles are intended for use in the link layer of the hierarchical control architecture defined by the California Partners for Automated Transit and Highways (PATH) program. A non-stationary velocity profile which can be used to circulate traffic around a faster moving emergency vehicle is introduced, The effects on traffic flow are illustrated. A traffic flow controller that sustains nonstationary velocity profiles oil fully automated highways is designed. Controller stability is discussed stressing the usefulness of nonstationary velocity profiles in creating a moving area of low vehicle density. Simulation results obtained using SmartCap, a traffic flow, simulation program, demonstrate the fast circulation of an emergency vehicle in AHS while high traffic flow is maintained.

J	Chen, KS; Chung, CY; Wang, SW				Chen, KS; Chung, CY; Wang, SW			Measurement and three-dimensional Modeling of airflow and pollutant dispersion in an undersea traffic tunnel	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							URBAN STREET CANYONS; AIR-QUALITY; EMISSIONS; VEHICLE; FLOW	Airflow and pollutant dispersion in a cross-harbor traffic tunnel were experimentally and numerically studied. Concentrations of the gaseous pollutants CO, NO., and total hydrocarbons (THC) at three axial locations in the tunnel, together with traffic flow rate, traffic speed, and types of vehicle were measured. Three-dimensional (3D) turbulent flow and dispersion of air pollutants in the tunnel were modeled and solved numerically using the finite volume method. Traffic emissions were modeled accordingly as banded line sources along the tunnel floor. The results reveal that cross-sectional concentrations are nonuniformly distributed and that concentrations rise with downstream distance. The piston effect of vehicles alone can provide 9-23% dilution of air pollutants in the tunnel, compounded to a 23-74% dilution effect according to the ventilation condition.

J	Sasoh, A				Sasoh, A			Impact of unsteady disturbance on multi-lane traffic flow	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						traffic flow; multi-lane; nonlinear stability; relaxation time; unsteady disturbance; shock waves	SELF-ORGANIZATION; MODEL; SEGREGATION; TRANSITION; WAVES; JAMS	In this paper, we study on mufti-lane traffic flow of up to four lanes experiencing non-linear, unsteady disturbance. The analysis is done based on car-following computation using a modified optimal velocity model. The unsteady disturbance to homogeneous flow is exerted as the stop-and-go motion of the leading car in the first lane. The strength of the disturbance is quantified with the duration time of the stop; its effect is evaluated from the time variation of local car flux. In general, mufti-lane flow is less sensitive to the strength of the disturbance than single-lane flow is. In the mufti-lane flow, once a weak disturbance causes a triggering lane change, it in turn induces successive disturbances and lane changes, eventually forming much fluctuated flow. Therefore, the strength of the initial disturbance becomes less important. The degradation in the car flux of such fluctuated mufti-lane flow is better than that in unstable single-lane flow. The transient car flux is influenced mainly by the value of the relaxation time appearing in the equation of motion along lanes, and is less sensitive to the number of lanes.

J	Zhu, ZJ; Wu, QS; Jiang, R; Wu, TQ				Zhu, ZJ; Wu, QS; Jiang, R; Wu, TQ			Numerical study on traffic flow with single parameter state equation	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow; parameters; numerical analysis; kinematic wave theory	DIFFERENCE	Traffic flow has been studied numerically by solving the kinematic wave equation with the second-order Monotone Upwind Scheme of Conservation Law (MUSCL), together with the boundary and initial conditions, which are examined by a computer based random generator derived from the Erlang process of order 250. With regard to traffic mixing, a fundamental flow-density diagram of road traffic is presented, where the ratio between the optimal and jam densities is used as a single parameter; its value is predicted by assuming that fast moving vehicles have a relatively large free speed but slow moving vehicles have a smaller free speed. Simple analysis for the state equation indicates that the parameter should be in a proper range from 0.333 to 0.618 to ensure a free speed beyond the optimal traffic speed. The effects of the single parameter on the spread of traffic shock wave have been discussed. It is found that, for congested traffic flow, in the case of a given flow density at the place of inlet and exit, the effects of the parameter on the propagation speed is apparent, while in the case of assigned flow rate on the inlet and the exit boundaries, the propagation speed is slightly dependent on the parameter. The propagation of density and flow rate fluctuation can be observed clearly from the corresponding 3D presentations.

J	Smilowitz, KR; Daganzo, CF				Smilowitz, KR; Daganzo, CF			Reproducible features of congested highway traffic	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						traffic flow theory; congestion prediction; traffic spillovers; bottleneck effects; experimental verification		Observation of a four-mile long, inhomogeneous, congested traffic stream revealed that vehicle accumulations between detectors vary with flow in a predictable way, and that a macroscopic kinematic wave with a reproducible speed exists in queues despite unusual traffic behavior. As a result, time-dependent vehicle trip times and accumulations inside long queues (and the queue length itself) can be predicted from readily available data without using any "degrees of freedom" to fit the parameters of a model. Experimental vehicle counts were within 20 vehicles of the predictions for over two hours. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Helbing, D; Hennecke, A; Shvetsov, V; Treiber, M				Helbing, D; Hennecke, A; Shvetsov, V; Treiber, M			Micro- and macro-simulation of freeway traffic	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						congested traffic flow; vehicle queues; phase diagram; micro-macro link; car-following model	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; KINEMATIC WAVES; DYNAMICAL MODEL; PHASE-DIAGRAM; FLOW; STATES; DERIVATION; HIERARCHY; JAMS	We present simulations of congested traffic in circular and open systems with a non-local, gas-kinetic-based traffic model and a novel car-following model. The model parameters are all intuitive and can be easily calibrated. Micro- and macro-simulations with these models for identical vehicles on a single lane produce the same traffic states, which also qualitatively agree with empirical traffic observations. Moreover, the phase diagrams of traffic states in the presence of bottlenecks for the microscopic car-following model and the macroscopic gas-kinetic-based model almost agree. In both cases, we found metastable regimes, spatially coexistent states, and a small region of tristability. The distinction of different types of vehicles (cars and long vehicles) yields additional insight and allows us to reproduce empirical data even more realistically, including the observed fluctuation properties of traffic flows like the wide scattering of congested traffic data. Finally, as an alternative to the gas-kinetic approach, we propose a new scheme for deriving non-local macroscopic traffic models from given microscopic car-following models. Assuming identical (macroscopic) initial and boundary conditions, we show that there are microscopic models for which the corresponding macroscopic version displays an almost identical dynamics. This enables us to combine micro- and macro-simulations of road sections by simple algorithms, and even to simulate them simultaneously. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lo Schiavo, M				Lo Schiavo, M			A personalized kinetic model of traffic flow	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						generalized Boltzmann; traffic models; nonlinear sciences; evolution equations	DERIVATION; DYNAMICS	A kinetic model of traffic flow on roads is developed which takes into account not only the multilane structure of the road, but also the multifaced aspect of traffic in which different kinds of vehicles and of drivers interact together. Differentiation among the various types of individuals is accomplished by introducing, in the traffic simulation, a modeling methodology proper of sociobiological population dynamics. In particular, the evolution is described by a generalized Boltzmann model for several population density functions. On the other hand, the intrinsic character of the individual driver-vehicle, that is free to autonomously decide about his future, justifies the introduction of an independent linear stochastic term-in the evolution equation, in addition to the quadratic interaction one, that is uncommon in these models.

J	Gartner, NH; Stamatiadis, C				Gartner, NH; Stamatiadis, C			Arterial-based control of traffic flow in urban grid networks	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						traffic flow; traffic control; traffic signals; bandwidth progression; mixed-integer linear programming	SIGNALS	Urban networks are typically composed of a grid of arterial streets. Optimal control of the traffic signals in the grid system is essential for the effective operation of the network. In this paper, we present mathematical programming models for the development of optimal arterial-based progression schemes. Such schemes are widely used for traffic signal control in arterial streets. Under such a scheme, a continuous green band is provided in each direction along the artery at the desired speed of travel to facilitate the movement of through traffic along the arterial. Traditional schemes consist of uniform-width progressions. New approaches generate variable bandwidth progressions in which each directional road section is allocated an individually weighted band that can be adapted to the prevailing traffic flows on that link. Mixed-integer linear programming is used for the optimization. Simulation results indicate that this method can produce considerable gains in performance when compared with traditional progression methods. By introducing efficient computational techniques, this method also lends itself to a natural extension for incorporation in a dynamic traffic management system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It accounts for various qualitative features of the evolution of the density and speed of cars along a crowded road. The model consists of a 2 x 2 system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws generating a Cauchy problem which is well posed for all reasonable initial data.

The numerical simulation shows that the capacity of the road decreases in the presence of pedestrians. If the traffic flow rate is small, the traffic flow is basically unaffected even if some pedestrians traverse the road. However, if the flow rate exceeds a critical value, the vehicles cannot pass without delay, and a traffic jam appears. We also discuss simplified conditions of the model and accordingly present a modified model, which predicts qualitatively the same results except with a different capacity.

J	Lubashevsky, I; Kalenkov, S; Mahnke, R				Lubashevsky, I; Kalenkov, S; Mahnke, R			Towards a variational principle for motivated vehicle motion	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; DYNAMICAL MODEL; JAMS; CAR; CONGESTION; SOLITON; DELAY	We deal with the problem of deriving the microscopic equations governing individual car motion based on assumptions about the strategy of driver behavior. We presume the driver behavior to be a result of a certain compromise between the will to move at a speed that is comfortable for him under the surrounding external conditions, comprising the physical state of the road, the weather conditions, etc., and the necessity to keep a safe headway distance between the cars in front of him. Such a strategy implies that a driver can compare the possible ways of further motion and so choose the best one. To describe the driver preferences, we introduce the priority functional whose extremals specify the driver choice. For simplicity we consider a single-lane road. In this case solving the corresponding equations for the extremals we find the relationship between the current acceleration, velocity, and position of the car. As a special case we get a certain generalization of the optimal velocity model similar to the "intelligent driver model'' proposed by Treiber and Helbing.

J	Zhao, Y; Kockelman, KM				Zhao, Y; Kockelman, KM			The propagation of uncertainty through travel demand models: An exploratory analysis	ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article								The future operations of transportation systems involve a lot of uncertainty - in both inputs and model parameters. This work investigates the stability of contemporary transport demand model outputs by quantifying the variability in model inputs, such as zonal socioeconomic data and trip generation rates, and simulating the propagation of their variation through a series of common demand models over a 25-zone network. The results suggest that uncertainty is likely to compound itself rather than attenuate - over a series of models. Mispredictions at early stages (e.g., trip generation) in multi-stage models appear to amplify across later stages. While this effect may be counteracted by equilibrium assignment of traffic flows across a network, predicted traffic flows are highly and positively correlated.

J	Thorsen, I; Gitlesen, JP				Thorsen, I; Gitlesen, JP			A simulation approach to studying the sensitivity of commuting-flow predictions with respect to specific changes in spatial structure	ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING A-ECONOMY AND SPACE			English	Article							DESTINATION CHOICE; INTERACTION-MODELS; INFRASTRUCTURE; SET	Economic evaluations of investments in transportation infrastructure in general call for traffic-flow predictions. In many studies such predictions are based on a doubly constrained modeling framework, with no explicit attempts to account for possible effects from changes in the location pattern of population and employment. In this paper we focus on the sensitivity of commuting-flow predictions to specific changes in the marginal totals of a trip-distribution model. We approach this problem through a series of simulation experiments where population and employment are systematically redistributed between different zones within the region. With this procedure we provide some quantitative estimates of prediction errors that follow from the inability to take into account long-term consequences of the location pattern of firms and households. We also carry through a simulation experiment that focuses on how benefits of different road investments are interrelated, and depend on spatial-structure characteristics.

J	Corvalan, RM; Osses, M; Urrutia, CM				Corvalan, RM; Osses, M; Urrutia, CM			Hot emission model for mobile sources: Application to the metropolitan region of the city of Santiago, Chile	JOURNAL OF THE AIR & WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION			English	Article							MOTOR-VEHICLE EMISSIONS; TRAFFIC EMISSIONS; SYSTEM	Depending on the final application, several methodologies for traffic emission estimation have been developed. Emission estimation based on total miles traveled or other average factors is a sufficient approach only for extended areas such as national or worldwide areas. For road emission control and strategies design, microscale analysis based on real-world emission estimations is often required. This involves actual driving behavior and emission factors of the local vehicle fleet under study. This paper reports on a microscale model for hot road emissions and its application to the metropolitan region of the city of Santiago, Chile. The methodology considers the street-by-street hot emission estimation with its temporal and spatial distribution. The input data come from experimental emission factors based on local driving patterns and traffic surveys of traffic flows for different vehicle categories. The methodology developed is able to estimate hourly hot road CO, total unburned hydrocarbons (THCs), particulate matter (PM), and NO, emissions for predefined day types and vehicle categories.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, CF			A behavioral theory of multi-lane traffic flow. Part I: Long homogeneous freeway sections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						traffic dynamics; driver psychology; lane-changing; unexplained traffic phenomena	KINEMATIC WAVES; FEATURES	This paper proposes a macroscopic behavioral theory of traffic dynamics for homogeneous, multi-lane freeways. The theory makes predictions for separate groups of lanes while recognizing that the traffic stream is usually composed of aggressive and timid drivers. Its principles are so simple that non-scientist drivers can understand them. The simplest version of the theory, which is described in its full complexity without calculus, is shown to be qualitatively consistent with experimental observations, including the most puzzling. Its predictions agree with the following phenomena: (i) the 'reversed lambda' pattern frequently observed in scatter-plots of flow versus occupancy and the lane-specific evolution of the data points with time, including the 'hysteresis' phenomenon, (ii) the lane-specific patterns in the time series of speed (and flow) in both queued and unqueued traffic, and (iii) the peculiar ways in which disturbances of various types propagate across detector stations. The latter effects include the evolution of both, stoppages and transitions between the queued and unqueued traffic regimes. The simple model is specified by means of eight observable parameters. The paper gives a recipe for solving any well-posed problem with this model and does so in sufficient detail to allow the development of computer models. A few approaches and possible generalizations are suggested. Part II of this paper, devoted to freeway sections near on-ramps, will attempt to explain in more detail than previously attempted how queuing begins at merges. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, CF			A behavioral theory of multi-lane traffic flow. Part II: Merges and the onset of congestion	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								This paper examines the behavior of multi-lane freeway traffic past on-ramps, building on the continuum model of part I and focusing on the onset of congestion. The main complication is that rabbits (fast vehicles) entering from an on-ramp usually stay on the shoulder lane(s) of the freeway for some distance before merging into the fast lane(s). An idealization is proposed, where this distance is taken to be the same for all vehicles. As a result, the system behaves: as if there was a fixed buffer zone downstream of the on-ramp where entering rabbits cannot change lanes. The model of part I is extended to capture the peculiarities of traffic within such a buffer zone, including its two end-points: the ''entrance'' and the ''merge''. The onset of congestion is described by means of waves. The paper shows that this highly idealized model (and its more realistic cousins) explains qualitatively all the puzzling facts discussed in part I without introducing obviously unreasonable phenomena. A typical sequence of events during the onset of congestion is predicted to be as follows: (i) increased on-ramp flows and the ensuing merging maneuvers into the median (passing) plane generate a (fast-moving) queue at the merge that grows on the median lane(s) of the buffer; (ii) when the speed in this queue drops below the level on the shoulder lanes, a 1-pipe queue forms at the merge, which then grows upstream across all lanes; (iii) if the front of this queue moves slowly forward, as per the model of part I, then the lane-flows at the merge would be at ''capacity'' from then on (with roughly the same speed across all lanes) but downstream of the front there would be a ''discharge state'' with less total flow. Therefore, an observer downstream of the merge would see this discharge state before the capacity state, and would record a drop in flow followed by a recovery. If the front of the queue would move slowly backward, then the sequence of events following (ii) is somewhat different. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL				Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL			A microscopic model for phase transitions in traffic flow	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; STATES; PHYSICS; JAMS	A microscopic model for phase transitions in traffic flow is presented. The basic assumption of the model is that hypothetical homogeneous and stationary, i.e. 'equilibrium' states of the model cover a two-dimensional region in the flow-density plane. As in empirical observations, in the model moving jams do not spontaneously occur in free flow. Instead, the first-order phase transition to synchronized flow beginning at some density in free flow is realized. The moving jams emerge only in synchronized flow. As a result, the diagrams of patterns (states) both for a homogeneous road without bottlenecks and at on-ramps are qualitatively different from those found in other approaches at present. In particular, only one type of pattern occurs at on-ramps, if the flow rates to the on-ramp and on the road are high enough: in this general pattern synchronized flow occurs upstream of the on-ramp and wide moving jams spontaneously emerge in this synchronized flow.

The simulator uses the S standard map of the Navigation System Researchers' Association, which is the map used in actual car navigation devices, and produces environments where spontaneous traffic congestion occurs. The traffic flow model we propose is based on Nagel's multiple-velocities model. Additionally, we propose an intersection model and a lane change model. We confirmed that our simulator works effectively for real road maps.

The extent of the congestion can be predicted using a model based on the Brownian motion process. The control algorithm of traffic flow is constructed with the recurrence property of a Brownian motion and Martingale property of the stochastic process.

According to true characters of statistical distribution of roadway flows, the fundamental assumption is established. By theoretical calculation a mathematical model of Gauss-Markov characteristic distribution of traffic flows is established for describing roadway flows. With consideration on synthetic action of all random disturbance factors, the data of roadway flows are amended by normal stochastic process of white noise in analytic demonstration. Based on established mathematical model the research and analysis of related functions and power spectral density of each item of the model expression are conducted according to estimated theory. Using Wiener's theory, the analysis of power spectral density of continuous stationary stochastic process including stochastic items of roadway flows and comprehensive disturbance is conducted. To yield the optimization characteristics of minimum error of linear mean square, according to the different selected parameters, the profound research is conducted. Optimum prediction and optimum filtering analysis based on the different parameters using in Wiener-hopf equation is provided. Linear time invariant system is designed according to different case separately. The result and the process of theoretic analysis show that the conducted research of Wiener filtering and pre-estimation theory using observed roadway flows including stochastic disturbance factor is capable of reflecting the true data of roadway traffic flows, it has important values of theoretic study and practical application. Then the merits and demerits of the theoretic deduce is discussed, some research to be taken in the future is proposed.

Consequently, in the latest decade, a growing body of advances concerning several aspects of this transportation system has appeared in the operation research literature. At the best of our knowledge Petri Nets (PN) have not been yet used for the graphical description, the analysis of flows and the control of the ground holding problems. Due to the characteristics of the air transportation systems, this paper shows that Controlled Stochastic Petri Net (CSPN) models of such a system are very efficient. Indeed, the presented CSPN model aims at predicting and minimizing the airborne delays, taking into consideration the long-term horizon. This mathematical tool is useful for the design of additional runways. Indeed, it involves sizing the required capacity of the airport. This CSPN model is described and defined and we show that it has interesting properties. We illustrate the interest of such a tool with a numerical application in which multiple runway patterns are possible and where we retain the optimal solution.

This paper applies an artificial neural network known as the self-organising feature map (SOM) to the visualisation of road traffic flow. Intelligent data visualisation is valuable in road traffic management systems. These systems frequently require rapid assimilation of spatio-temporal data, and projection to anticipate congestion for appropriate short term management and longer term planning. The SOM produces a 2-dimensional clustering of data creating an output map where the clusters are topologically arranged. This means that there is a continuity between the clusters in terms of the similarity of the classes represented. We train a SOM with representations of a road network and its traffic load at sequential points in time and use the self-organization to cluster these snapshots, Subsequently, the evolution of these patterns can be visualised by trace lines upon the surface of the SOM. Additionally we use a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate road traffic and generate data suitable road traffic data for training the SOM. We show how the SOM could form the interface to a hardware based simulation model, such as implemented by reconfigurable computing.

A key component of this strategy is to ensure that traffic flows efficiently through work zones. Work is described that was performed for ODOT to determine whether commercially available traffic simulation models could be calibrated to yield accurate queue length and delay time predictions for planning purposes in freeway work zones. Four work zones on multilane freeways were selected by ODOT for collection of the calibration data. Traffic flow video records were obtained at the four selected work zones by two ODOT video recording vans equipped with 15-m masts. Traffic flow parameters were extracted from the video records with the Mobilizer-PC software package. The traffic simulation and prediction tools investigated included the Highway Capacity Software (HCS), Synchro, CORSIM (under ITRAF and TRAFVU), NetSim, and a macroscopic model called QueWZ92. Simulation models were constructed with all models for the selected work zones, and the simulated queue lengths and delay times were compared with the data extracted from the field data with Mobilizer-PC. The results of this study indicated that the microscopic simulation packages could not be calibrated to the oversaturated conditions that existed at the work zones. The calibrated microscopic simulation packages underestimated the length of the queues that formed in the real world. The macroscopic QueWZ92 produced more accurate estimates than did the microscopic packages.

Even though both systems are controlled by traffic signals, they primarily operate independently of one another. The integrated operations of a surface street system and a freeway system were studied with VISSIM, a microscopic simulation model. A traffic network consisting of a surface street and a freeway segment was constructed in VISSIM. The surface street and freeway are connected through a diamond interchange with on-ramps and off-ramps. The objective of the study was to develop an integrated control algorithm for both the diamond interchange signal and the ramp-metering Signal. The proposed control algorithm, including an adaptive diamond interchange control and a traffic-responsive ramp-metering control were programmed with VISSIM's vehicle-actuated programming, which serves as an external control function for the simulation model. Preliminary tests of the proposed control algorithm indicated improved operations for both the surface street system and the freeway system. Traffic operations were significantly improved compared with nonadaptive diamond control and static ramp-metering control. Although similar performance measures were found (with the particular scenarios evaluated) with no-metering control, with the existing traffic-responsive ramp-metering control, and with the proposed traffic-responsive rampmetering control, the proposed control algorithm has more flexibility and may be adapted over a broader range of traffic flow conditions.

Heterogeneity and inconsistency are simulated by incorporation of different categories of driver behaviour and reassignment of categories with given probabilities at each time step. The method is able to reproduce many features of urban traffic, for which gap-acceptance models are less appropriate. Capacities of the minor-stream in a TWSC intersection are found to depend on flow rates of major-streams, also changes with flow rate ratio (FRR=flow rate of near lane: flow rate of far lane). Hence flow rates corresponding to each stream must be distinguished. The relationship between the performance of intersections and other traffic flow parameters is also considered. Vehicle movements in this paper relate to left-side driving, such as found in UK/Ireland. However, rules are generally applicable.

The Alarm Correlation Module (MCA) integrated with the System for Automatic MOnitoring of Traffic (SAMOT) will be described. The aims of the MCA are to anlyze, filter and correlate traffic flow anomalies detected by Video Image Processing (VIP) boards, to create adequate image sequences to be shown on operators Close-Circuit TVs and to display adequate messages in Variable Message Panels to keep motorists informed. Thus, the MCA provides SAMOT with an automatic processing tool that, based on traffic operators' experience and knowledge, supports operators in the interpretation of traffic situations and in the event-driven control of traffic anomalies. The MCA knowledge base implements a model of traffic flow concerning the most relevant traffic patterns and taking into account time and space dependence of detected traffic anomalies. The MCA integrated in SAMOT is a successful example of the knowledge-based approach applied to traffic monitoring and control. The MCA has been developed in collaboration with the SAMOT provider (Project Automation S.p.A.) and the Italian highway company (Societa' Autostrade S.p.A.). After a 6 months trial period, the system is now installed and functioning on two of the most crowded Italian highways.

Then the exploratory theoretical emissions-optimized trip-assignment model is used to estimate the maximum carbon monoxide emissions reductions under varying congestion levels on a hypothetical network. The experimental results indicate moderate reductions in system-level vehicle emissions under emissions-optimized trip assignment compared with the conventional time-dependent user-equilibrium and system-optimized models. They suggest a possible method for approximating an upper boundary of expected emissions reductions using the standard travel-demand model with a modified trip-assignment objective function. The approximate boundary is useful as an estimate of emissions reductions that might be possible under optimal conditions (e.g., drivers choose emissions-optimized routes, fully implemented intelligent transportation systems, etc.). In other words, the upper boundary suggests that current traffic optimization strategies may be insufficient to fully remedy air quality problems created by mobile-source emissions.

Some of the concerns are that this proposed change may transfer operational problems to the downstream median opening and increase delay or travel time of vehicles making a left-turn egress from driveways. However, the effect of this treatment on roadway operations is not clear. A comprehensive study of operational effects of this treatment would be beneficial, both in setting design policy and in project-level design. Field studies were conducted to obtain the data necessary to quantify operational effects of this treatment at eight sites in the Tampa and Clearwater areas of Florida. About 300 h of field data were collected, including delay, travel time, traffic volume, speed, traffic control, and geometric data. An operational effects database was developed to perform statistical analyses. Delay and travel-time models of DLT and right turn plus U-turn (RTUT) were developed as a function of major and minor road-traffic-flow rates. The curves developed based on delay and travel-time models present a clear picture of the operational effects of the two types of movement. Moreover, a ratio model was developed to estimate how many drivers would prefer to make a RTUT rather than a DLT under certain traffic-flow conditions. Finally, the operations models were used to measure system performance of a full median opening versus a directional median opening from the standpoint of weighted-average total delay.

The standard transportation issues of traffic flow effects, driving cycles, rider mode choice behaviors, and economic evaluation have largely been neglected for motorcycles. A survey of existing and new Australian and other data was undertaken and the data assessed, along with topics covered in a more comprehensive Australian study. Geographic information system techniques for integrating motorcycle flow estimation and crash data were also assessed. Attitudinal work shows a strong propensity for motorcycle owners to enjoy not only their motorcycle travel but all other forms of travel more so than those who do not have Access to motorcycles. Practical policy directions are prop. owed to bring motorcycles onto an equal information and analysis footing a's other modes, for a coherent treatment of road capacity management and for using vulnerable road users as an anchor in an integrated policy and, planning context.

It proposes using a kind of buffer area (a kind of calming area) to regulate the traffic flow of ACTs when approaching to the merging areas. In addition, some,other functions such as overruling the mode of driving (from manual mode to automatically made or vice versa) have been proposed to be achieved in this area. For optimizing the operation of ACTs, it develops an optimization model to synchronize the speed and density of ACTs while approaching to the merging area. The results of analysis show that the buffer area would help to decrease the interruption of flow of Manually Driven Vehicles (MDVs) by ACTs and therefore will improve the average travel time of the ACTs for time periods when much interaction of ACTs and MDVs is expected. The results clearly show that a variation of 30 % In demand of ACTs on the DFL may increase the travel time of each ACT by about 18 %. But, comparing the same level of variation In flow of ACTs for different capacities of the buffer areas (20 to 100 ACT/h) the average travel time would decrease up to 2 %. Thus, increasing the capacity of the buffer area would not have a great Influence on the average travel time of each ACT. It also indicates that the same amount of increase in capacity of the buffer area only Improves the average speed of ACTs on the DFL by about 0.6 km/h. Therefore, finding the optimum capacity of the buffer area strongly depends on the level of demand and its variation in time.

The basic idea is that dynamic speed limits can create traffic conditions where shock waves can damp out faster. The control objective is to minimize the total time that vehicles spend in the network. For the prediction of the evolution or the traffic flows In the network we use an adapted version of the METANET model that takes the variable speed limits Into account. The coordinated control results in a network with less congestion, a higher outflow, and a lower total time spent. In addition, the receding horizon approach of MPC results in an adaptive, on-line control strategy that automatically takes changes in the system parameters into account.

A discussion of the way ramp metering tries to prevent, or postpone, congestion on a motorway is presented. As an example, a real-life motorway in Belgium is presented. We discuss a traffic flow model that is used in a receding horizon framework and we argue that the quality of the fit of the traffic flow model to the measurement data has an impact on the quality of the optimised metering signals. Therefore, we suggest to re-fit the most sensitive parameters of the traffic flow model on a regular basis. We conclude this paper with some simulation results.

Toll-lanes are projected with the purpose to offer a congestion-free lane for drivers who are willing to pay for the use of such a facility and a high level of service. A simulation study has been performed In order to assess the impacts of advanced driver support systems on the longitudinal and lateral performance near a motorway segment with a toll-lane situated in the median lane and traffic merging to an off-ramp. The conducted simulations varied in the level of toll-lone use, merging proportion, and system penetration In the vehicle fleet. Results from the simulations show the performance benefits of centralized distance control (CDC) for vehicles entering the merging zone. Negative Impacts on throughput were found with the application of an intelligent speed adapter (ISA) with a speed limit of 90 km/h in the merging zone. The combination of the two systems showed small improvements compared with the do-nothing case. The findings show that the application of toll-lanes in combination with advanced driver support systems add some additional longitudinal and lateral capacity to the main roadway.

Different learning algorithms for the NFS have been tested and evaluated using actual traffic data collected from the Loop 3 Freeway in Beijing, China. These testing results indicate that the NFS based approach Is an effective method for the short-tern traffic flow forecasting. To demonstrate the advantage of the proposed NFS approach, a comparison with a typical neural network based approach has been made.

The proposed approach includes two major parts: (1) a discrete-time non-linear stochastic model which denotes the time-varying relationships of lane traffic state variables and control variables under conditions of lane-blocking incidents, and (2) a realtime control algorithm for dynamically predicting control variables. To generate efficiently traffic data used in model tests, we employed the Paramics microscopic traffic simulator, which is developed to model and analyze ITS traffic flow conditions. The preliminary test results indicate the superiority of the proposed real-time signal control method in comparison with fixed-time signal control modes which are presently used at the study site.

The approach views the roadway in terms of the underlying densities, segmenting the roadway into blocks of constant density. Using hydrodynamic theory, we describe how these blocks can be used to provide a solution method to the DNLP with a continuous representation of space and time which is readily implementable. This solution method provides an exact solution with piece-wise linear link travel times. We present a pseudocode description of the algorithm and discuss a sample computer Implementation.

Application of remotely sensed imagery in consideration to analysis with vector-typed digital data sets in the node-link structure can effectively used in transportation planning, being very large and complex task using lots of data sets in various fields. In this study, this reference modeling with Landsat 7 ETM+, IKONOS 1 in color imagery, and KOMPSAT EOC in 2000 was carried out in a local governments, Namyangju-city, nearby metropolitan Seoul, Korea. While, thematic Land-use digital data sets in 1:5K and 1:1K scale were used to estimate urban growth and transportation-related land-use status. Meanwhile, some algorithms of traffic flow estimation and urban-rural indexing using land-use and DEM (Digital Elevation Model), as well as multiple remote sensing data with different resolution mentioned above were implemented as ArcView(TM)-GIS extensions, and applied actual data sets in this case study areas. It is concluded that remotely sensed imagery at transportation planning problems would be provide useful integrated information with multiple data sets.

Such effects are difficult to estimate from field tests on highways because of the low market penetration of ACC systems. The research approach used Monte Carlo simulations based on detailed models presented in the literature to estimate the quantitative effects of varying the proportions of vehicle control types on lane capacity. The results of this study can help to provide realistic estimates of the effects of the introduction of ACC to the vehicle fleet. Transportation system managers can recognize that the autonomous ACC systems now entering the market are unlikely to have significant positive or negative effects on traffic flow. An additional Value of studying ACC systems in this way is that these scenarios can represent the first steps in a deployment sequence that will lead to an automated highway system. Benefits gained at the early stages in this sequence, particularly through the introduction of cooperative ACC with priority access to designated (although not necessarily dedicated) lanes, can help support further investment in and development of automated highway systems.

Typical projects of autonomous driving systems were those national projects carried out in Japan, the US, and Europe from late 1980s [1-4]. However, most of the test vehicles used in these projects were passenger cars. Heavy-duty trucks and buses were rarely used due to the difficulties in realizing the expected features of actuators and the uncertainty in the construction of control systems resulting from the non-linearity of vehicle dynamics. This paper features an autonomous driving project, based on a linearlized model of longitudinal and lateral controlling, using a heavyduty truck equipped with advanced actuators and controllers as test vehicle. This test vehicle performs speed control by the information of onboard sensor and/or road-vehicle communications and also lane-keeping control by the information of lane marker sensors embedded on the track. It has been proven that the test vehicle could run stably at 60 km/h on straight line and at 40 km/h on a curvature of 60R. Details on the system constitution, the vehicle control algorithm and test results are described below.

J	Abdulhai, B; Porwal, H; Recker, W				Abdulhai, B; Porwal, H; Recker, W			Short-term traffic flow prediction using neuro-genetic algorithms	ITS JOURNAL			English	Article						neural networks; traffic flow; genetic algorithms; prediction; freeway		This paper presents a new short-term traffic flow prediction system based on an advanced Time Delay Neural Network (TDNN) model, the structure of which is synthesized using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The model predicts flow and occupancy values at a given freeway section based on contributions from their recent temporal profile (over a few minutes) as well the spatial profile (including inputs from neighboring upstream and downstream sections). An in-depth investigation of the variables pertinent to traffic flow prediction was conducted examining the extent of the "look-back" in time interval, the extent of prediction in the future, the extent of spatial contribution, the resolution of the input data, and their effects on prediction accuracy The model's performance is validated using both simulated and real traffic flow data obtained from the ATMS Testbed in Orange County, California. Both temporal and spatial effects were found to be essential for proper prediction. Results obtained indicate that the prediction errors vary inversely with the extent of the spatial contribution, and that the inclusion of three loop stations in both directions of the subject station is sufficient for practical purposes. Also, the longer the extent of prediction, the more the predicted values tend toward the mean of the actual, for which case the optimal look-back interval also shortens. The results also indicate that the level of data aggregation/resolution should be comparable to the prediction horizon for best accuracy. The model performed acceptably using both simulated and real data. The model also showed potential to be superior to such other well-known neural network models as the Multi layer Feed-forward (MLF) when applied to the same problem.

This effort is the first stage of evaluating micro-simulators in terms of their ability to model and analyze Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) under faster-than-real-time conditions. We utilize "Paramics," a particularly promising ITS-capable advanced traffic flow simulator and visualization tool, as one of an array of newly emerging ITS-capable simulation tools and we apply it to the Irvine network as part of a staged effort to model the much larger Southern California network. The driver and vehicle models and parameters were developed to reflect U.K. driver and vehicle characteristics. In this effort we explain our procedure used the calibrate these parameters to reproduce local U.S. traffic behavior. We built a model of a conventional U.S. freeway/arterial network in Southern California and calibrated its parameters using on-line field data. The calibrated models are validated, both at the section and network levels, and evaluated relative to their potential application in Advanced Traffic Management and Information Systems (ATMIS). Based on obtained results, the calibrated model performed well during validation on a freeway link. On the full network, the vehicle release mechanism showed some time-lag in releasing demand onto the network. This is potentially due to stacking of vehicles in memory before adequate headways are found on the road to release the vehicles. Although the problem itself is simple, its effects on the results were notable.

The provision of dynamic traffic information on a real-time basis to individual vehicles is expected to settle traffic congestion caused by the imbalance of traffic flow distribution to the network of roads. However, it also has been indicated that real-time traffic information disorders the traffic flow because of a driver rush for the "appropriate" route of the moment. In this paper, we show that real-time traffic information based on average velocity gives rise to fluctuation with chaotic structure in the relaxation process of the traffic flow formed by cellular automata. On the other hand, it is proposed that real-time traffic information composed by time-differentiation of average velocity could be an effective way to relieve the fluctuation of the traffic flow.

It is difficult to predict travel time because there is much affection of uncertain factors. In this paper the average space speed is adopted as medium variable. The Artificial Neural Network technology is applied to map the relationship of the traffic flow and average-space speed Then average space speed was conversed to average travel time. This approach was tested using the data from an arterial road in Changchun. The result shows that this method can make the prediction calculation more reliable, more cost-efficient and easier.

A first set of analyses explores regression models for minute-by-minute traffic flows, taking into account time of day, day of the week, and recent upstream detector-based flows. Day- and link-specific random effects are used in a hierarchical statistical modelling framework. A second set of analyses captures day-specific idiosyncrasies in traffic patterns by including parameters that may vary throughout the day. Model fit and short-term predictions of flows are thus improved significantly. A third set of analyses includes recent downstream flows as additional predictors. These further improvements, though marginal in most cases, can be quite radically useful in cases of very marked breakdown of freeway flows on some links. These three modelling stages are described and developed in analyses of observational flow data from a set of links on Interstate Highway 5 (1-5) near Seattle.

Different techniques and instruments, each one with specific advantages and disadvantages, can be used for counting the vehicles on a transportation network. In this paper the use of a passive acoustic detector together with two neural networks working sequentially is proposed for counting the cars on the urban roads. The results obtained with this system are satisfactory and comparable with the existing ones. The proposed system also shows a large improvement of the cost/benefit ratio.

Based on a cellular automaton traffic flow model the simulation, which is coupled with measured data from induction loops etc., can provide network-wide information about the current traffic state. The simulation of the whole network is performed in multiple real-time. The framework is applied to the freeway network of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), where traffic data from about 3,500 inductive loops axe available and provided on-line minute by minute. Technical aspects of the simulation, e.g., the network structure and the incorporation of the on-line data, are illustrated. This is followed by a discussion of the efficiency of the simulator. Furthermore, the results of the on-line simulation, i.e., daily traffic demands and the traffic state of NRW are given.

Configurations of cars on the road are simulated by using the equations and many metastable local congested states are found in two-dimensional region on density-flow diagram. There are three typical states in the congested states: The first is that cars advance by stop- and go-flow on their own lanes without lane-chan.-e and values of the flow are stable in time. The second is that cars change the lane periodically with several time-steps, The third is that they advance changing the lane that induces fluctuating of the flow with extremely long period. This fluctuating flow exists in wide range between car densities 5/12 and 3/4. The metastable states are discussed in connection with the synchronized states observed in the traffic flow on expressway. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The basic idea is that speed limits can increase the range in which ramp metering is useful. The control objective is to minimize the total time that vehicles spend in the network. For the prediction of the evolution of the traffic flows in the network we use an adapted version of the METANET model that takes the variable speed limits into account. The coordinated control results in a network with less congestion, a higher outflow, and a lower total time spent. In addition, the receding horizon approach of WC results in an adaptive, on-line control strategy that automatically takes changes in the system parameters into account.

ACC systems are commonly designed to maintain a constant time-gap (CTG) between vehicles during vehicle-following. In this paper, a new inter-vehicle spacing policy that is a nonlinear function of vehicle speed is developed. The new spacing policy, referred to as a variable time-gap (VTG) policy, leads to stable traffic flow and a higher capacity. Practical advantages of using the new spacing policy are demonstrated through traffic simulations. However, a detailed analysis of safety shows that the traditional CTG policy is superior in several scenarios. The VTG policy is then modified by explicitly taking inter-vehicle relative velocity into account in the definition of desired spacing. The resulting new spacing policy is shown to provide stable traffic flow, a higher capacity and the same level of safety as the CTG policy.

Due to the initial unsatisfactory results we found using the Papageorgiou's traffic flow model [7, 8], we revised the model while retaining key logical elements. Based on the real data collected from the RTMS traffic detector, we identify the model parameters which give the best coincidence between the calibrated model and the real process. The model parameter identification procedure is formulated as an optimization problem which is solved by nonlinear programming. Our simulation results show reasonably good traffic flow estimation with acceptably small error on that road section.

We have been studying the emotional algorithm which evaluates and decides the emotional status of artificial system with artificial emotional model. The emotional algorithm estimates the emotional value based on the emotional functions, which are defined on the emotional space. This paper adds the new function to evaluate the emotional statement. The individualities of each traffic signal enable to optimize the control of signals to make the traffic flows smooth. This report proposes the principal architecture of the emotional algorithm with above individuality and the traffic signal system simulator using them. The numerical simulations clarify the effectiveness of the new emotional algorithm with individuality and show the optimized control for each traffic signal.

The fundamental diagram obtained by the simulation shows the capacity of road more approaches to the observed data compared with that of NaSch model. There exist two branches in some density regions in the fundamental diagram, which illustrates the existence of the metastable state near the critical point and the phase separation. Moreover, we find that the ID cellular automaton model is quite sensitive to the order of rules and the modification presented herein is more reasonable and realistic.

An interactive search through context simulations is a tool to combine the city-planner experience with the cost of proposed solutions. ULISSE (Urban Location Interactive System for SErvices) is a system designed to make this interaction possible and efficient, Its core components are a model of the urban transportation network which simulates the facility access cost and a highly visual interface which makes natural the interaction of urban planners with model inputs and outcomes. The efficiency of the interaction depends on the quality and immediacy of the communication tool and the simulation turn-around time. The used model represents the urban transportation system by an electrical network. The network analysis is made by the program SPICE whose resulting information defines optimal differential traffic flows and travel-times for the chosen scenario. The optimal service location is found as the final point of an interactive procedure where environmental parameters and facility locations are changed according to the planners' choices and the outcomes are constantly compared.

Therefore, impacts of roads and their traffic on, for example, energy consumption, emissions, noise and habitat fragmentation for the fauna must be identified. This paper shows the opportunities of a GIS, developed for this purpose. To promote traffic safety, in the Netherlands a concentration of present diffuse traffic flows on minor roads within an area on a limited number of trunk roads is pursued. Several alternative network solutions may realise this concentration, each with its own impacts. The GIS enables both an overview per road link and on a regional scale. In a case study, energy consumption and emissions increased on a regional scale. Noise and habitat fragmentation decreased by concentration of traffic flows. Because of the impacts on habitat fragmentation strongly depend on the location within the region, both scales, regional and on the link level, should be taken into account. It is well known that a GIS is a powerful instrument in traffic planning. This paper shows that an enlargement in the wider context of environmental issues may be helpful to include such impacts in the rights-of-way planning and management of rural road networks.

Since these characteristics are observed prior to crash occurrence, they are referred to as "crash precursors." The objectives are (a) to explore factors contributing to changes in crash rate for individual vehicles traveling over an urban freeway and (b) to develop a probabilistic model relating significant crash precursors to changes in crash potential. The data used to examine crash precursors were extracted from 38 loop detector stations on a 10-km stretch of the Gardiner Express way in Toronto for a 13-month period. An aggregate log-linear model was developed relating crash rates to the selected crash precursors observed upstream of the crash site. The results of this analysis suggest that the variation of speed and traffic density are statistically significant predictors of crash frequency after controlling for road geometry, weather, and time of day. With the model, crash potential can be established based on the precursors obtained from real-time traffic data.

Risk is often used to describe the level of safety in transportation systems by incorporating a measure of exposure, such as traffic How or kilometers driven. The most commonly applied definition of accident risk states that risk is a linear function of accidents and traffic flow. This definition, however, creates problems for transportation systems that are characterized by a nonlinear relationship between these variables. The primary objective of the original research was to illustrate the application of accident prediction models (APMs) to estimate accident risk on transportation networks. (APMs are useful tools for establishing the proper relationship between accidents and traffic flow.) The secondary objective was to describe important issues and limitations surrounding the application of APMs for this purpose. To accomplish these objectives, APMs were applied to a computerized transportation network with the help of EMME/2. The accident risk was computed with the traffic flow output of the computer program. The results were dramatic and unexpected: in essence, the individual risk of being involved in a collision decreases as traffic flow increases. The current and most common model form of APMs explains this outcome. The application of these results may have significant effects on transportation policy and intelligent transportation system strategies.

The fourth lane may be converted to bicycle lanes, sidewalks, or on-street parking. Road diets are sometimes implemented with the objective of reducing vehicle speeds as well as the number of motor vehicle crashes and injuries. A study was conducted to investigate the actual effects of road diets on motor vehicle crashes and injuries. Twelve road diets and 25 comparison sites in California and Washington cities were analyzed. Crash data were obtained for these road diet (2,068 crashes) and comparison sites (8,556 crashes). A "before" and "after" analysis using a "yoked comparison" study design found that the percent of road diet crashes occurring during the "after" period was about 6% lower than that of the matched comparison sites. However, a separate analysis in which a negative binomial model was used to control for possible differential changes in average daily traffic, study period, and other factors indicated no significant treatment effect. Crash severity was virtually the same at road diets and comparison sites. There were some differences in crash type distributions between road diets and comparison sites, but not between the "before" and "after" periods. Conversion to a road diet should be made on a case-by-case basis in which traffic flow, vehicle capacity, and safety are all considered. It is also recommended that the effects of road diets be further evaluated under a variety of traffic and roadway conditions.

Such analytical methods have traditionally been aimed at estimating the overall mass of individual pollutants with an emphasis on gaseous emissions. Significantly less attention is usually given to the quantification of particle emissions. Extensive data relating to fine and ultra-fine airborne particle concentration levels and the corresponding contributing vehicles have been collected at two significantly different Brisbane sites. Analysis of the relationships between the data so far point to a strong correlation between traffic flow and meteorological variables and particle concentrations.

The traffic noise has become one of the greatest social effects of pollution of urban environment, and severity threatened the people's normal live and health. Traffic noise has the characters of higher intensity, greater incidence and longer time effect. analyzing and forecasting the urban traffic noise can provide decision-making basis for controlling urban traffic noise. This paper has set up the quantitative relation among the real traffic noise and the road composition, traffic flow and traffic composition. This theoretic model is proved validity by the data measured in some roads of Suzhou city. According to the measured data, this paper has also set up the statistics models about the power difference and hundred percent sound level L(10), L(50) and L(90) with traffic flow.

Semi-automated vehicles, such as ACC Vehicles, with the capability to automatically follow each other in the same lane, will coexist with manually driven vehicles on the existing roadway system before they become universal. This mixed fleet scenario creates new capacity and safety issues. In this paper, simulation results of various mixed fleet scenarios under different ACC laws are presented. Explicit comparison of two ACC laws, Constant Time Headway (CTH) and Variable Time Headway (VTH), are based on these results. It is found that the latter one has better performance in terms of capacity and stability of traffic. Throughput increases with the proportion of CTH vehicles when flow is below capacity conditions. But above capacity, speed variability increases and speed drops with the CTH traffic compared with manual traffic, while the VTH traffic always performs better.

Dynamical models for car cluster formation based on stochastic methods (master equation, Langevin equation, Fokker-Planck-equation) have not been extensively exploited so far in traffic theory. It is the aim of the present contribution to present a stochastic description of jam formation in synchronized traffic using master equation approach. The main and central point is to construct the transition probabilities for the jump processes to condensate one free car to a car cluster or to evaporate the first congested car into free flow. This method allows us to interpret the phase transitions between different states of traffic flow in analogy to aggregation phenomena in metastable and unstable systems like supersaturated van der Waals gases.

The indices to evaluate travel time reliability are estimated by the simple macroscopic simulations with different quality of traffic information. The traffic flow simulation used in this study explicitly considers drivers' route choice behaviors under provision of dynamic traffic information This study shows a possibility that dynamic information may influences the travel time reliability of road network. Some basic findings obtained through the preliminary analyses are as follows. 1) The descriptive information on travel time might lead to deterioration of travel time reliability, especially in the case where the network traffic condition tends to be unstable. 2) Providing the additional information like short-term trend of travel time might improve travel time reliability.

Forty 1-min videotape segments showing different highway traffic flow conditions were displayed to a group of highway experts and users. They were asked to complete the relevant questionnaires on. the existence and acceptability of congestion for each video segment display. Five congestion-descriptive variables of travel speed, travel rate, delay rate. travel rate ratio, and delay ratio were determined for each video segment. Information about the values of congestion-descriptive variables for the displayed videos, questionnaire responses, and fuzzy set theory v ere used to develop congestion fuzzy set membership functions. The membership functions characterized the congestion intensity fuzzy values of "congested" and "unacceptably congested." The membership functions were suggested as congestion indexes measured on a scale of 0 to 1. In the questionnaire, the surveyed group also provided opinions regarding the relative importance of the descriptive variables in explaining congestion. This information was used to determine average weighting values for the developed indexes. Using the average weighting values, overall indexes for "congested" and "unacceptably congested" were developed. The overall congestion indexes were also suggested for congestion intensity assessment and evaluation. The relationships between the Highway Capacity Manual levels of service and the developed congestion indexes were studied. The results were used to address some issues regarding normative index development. Although the study findings are based on a rather limited database and are location specific, the applied methodology can be used to capture congestion intensity perception in any future index development. The study index development was based on fuzzy set theory and is suggested as an alternative or complementary approach to past normative index development methods.

The hybrid model consists of two components: a fuzzy C-means (FCM) method, which classifies traffic flow patterns into a couple of clusters, and a radial-basis-function (RBF) neural network, which develops forecasting models associated with each cluster. The new hybrid model was compared with previously developed clustering-based RBF models. In addition, the dynamic linear model was studied for comparison. The study results showed that the clustering based hybrid method did not produce time-lag phenomena, whereas the dynamic linear model and the RBF model without clustering revealed apparent time-lag phenomena. The forecasting performance for freeway traffic volumes from the San Antonio, Texas, TransGuide system shows that even though the hybrid of the FCM and RBF models appears to be promising, additional research efforts should be devoted to achieving more reliable traffic forecasting.

A study of such a model with two vehicle classes (e.g., passenger cars and trucks) showed that when both classes of traffic have identical free-flow speeds, the model (a) satisfies the first-in-first-out rule, (b) is anisotropic, and (c) has the usual shock and expansion waves and a family of contact waves. Different compositions of vehicle classes in this model propagate along contact waves. Such models can be used to study traffic evolution on long crowded highways where low-performance vehicles entrap high-performance ones.

On the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway, traffic congestion frequently occurs at merging bottleneck sections. There have been only a few research studies concerned with the traffic behavior and characteristics in these situations. Therefore, a three years extensive study has been undertaken to investigate traffic behavior and characteristics during traffic merging processes under congested traffic flow in order to design a safer and less congested merging points as well as a more efficient control at these bottleneck sections. The overall research approach is illustrated in Figure 1, emphasizing the second component, which represents this work. Sets of data capturing a wide range of information were collected using a videotape and image processing techniques. Comprehensive traffic surveys were conducted at two entrance ramps in the Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway. These data provided the fundamental information for investigating the ramp driver merging behavior, A theoretical framework for modeling ramp driver acceleration-deceleration behavior is presented. It uses the stimuli-response concept as a basic rule and is formulated as a modified form of the conventional car-following models. The collected data are used to calibrate the proposed model. The results indicate that on average 0.66 see time gap exist before ramp drivers respond to stimuli. It is found that the surrounding freeway vehicles affect significantly the ramp vehicle acceleration behavior. In addition, a simulation program was built using the developed acceleration-deceleration model, The simulated time-space trajectories of vehicles consistently fit well the observed data.

It starts with an assessment of recent research efforts on the fundamental diagram that attempt to establish linkages between "static" flow-density-speed relationships and "dynamic" traffic flow phenomena. It then discusses the emerging continuum models that treat multiple vehicle classes and lane types and the non-equilibrium models that eliminate certain undesirable properties in the high-order continuum models and capture more realistically the instabilities in traffic phase transitions. Some limited field observations associated with the discussed theories are also presented. The challenge to improve the existing continuum traffic flow model is briefly discussed.

The equilibrated variables in this new problem are the link flow means and covariance matrix. A heuristic solution algorithm is proposed, based on the solution of a sequence of SUE sub-problems. Numerical results are reported from the application of this technique to a realistic network, under the assumption of probit-based choice probabilities. In these tests, as the level of demand variability is increased (but the mean demand held fixed), the link flow variances predicted by the proposed model are seen to increase, but the effect on mean flows is relatively small. The increased variation in flows is, however, seen to have an inflationary effect on one of the prime indicators of network congestion, mean total travel cost.

J	Carslaw, DC; Beevers, SD				Carslaw, DC; Beevers, SD			The efficacy of low emission zones in central London as a means of reducing nitrogen dioxide concentrations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						exhaust emissions; nitrogen oxides; dispersion modelling	URBAN AIR-QUALITY; NO2	This paper considers the effects of different strategies that might be considered to reduce the impact made by road traffic on air pollution in London. The management of road traffic in large urban areas is one of many options being considered to reduce pollutant emissions to meet statutory air pollution objectives. Increasingly, the concept of a low emission zone (LEZ) is being proposed as a means of achieving this reduction. An assessment has been made of different LEZ scenarios in central London, which involve reducing traffic flow or modifying the vehicle technology mix. Methods of predicting annual mean nitrogen dioxide concentrations utilising comprehensive traffic data and air pollution measurements have been used to develop empirical prediction models. Comparisons with statutory air pollution objectives show that significant action will be required to appreciably decrease concentrations of nitrogen dioxide close to roads. The non-linear atmospheric chemistry leading to the formation of nitrogen dioxide, results in a complex relationship between vehicle emissions and ambient concentrations of the pollutant. We show that even ambitious LEZ scenarios in central London produce concentrations of nitrogen oxides that are achieved through a "do nothing" scenario only five years later.

There are very little data referring to urban goods transports, and national statistics do not allow analyses on the intra- or interurban level. Studies indicate that the future capacity problems will occur not in the national main road system but in or around the urban areas. Today about 20% of the traffic (road vehicle kilometer) in the urban areas are goods transports generated by the commercial and industrial life. Despite this, town- and traffic planning focus personal transports by tradition. To estimate the urban goods transports and to analyse how the business structure and localization affect the transport generation in urban areas, we need empirical data suitable for urban conditions. An empirical study has therefore been performed in 45 Swedish communities. The study has mapped an transports to and from a number of companies during one week. The study will estimate the trip generation for businesses in different branches and of different sizes in terms of trip frequencies, vehicle kilometres and origin-destination analyses. The aim is to create a transport generation model that can be used in urban planning in terms of environmental decisions, business localization and land use. A second aim is to develop methods to analyse transports with GIS-tools. This paper will present the design of the empirical study, and it will focus a discussion on method and definitions in the field of transportation.

Moreover, almost half of these deaths takes place in urban areas, where the conflicts between different traffic components (i.e. vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, etc.) are bigger. One of the levels which local authorities can handle to contain the phenomenon is Traffic Management, i.e. the set of all those measures reducing traffic volumes and conflicts among traffic streams, reducing vehicles speed and so on. Models and simulation procedures have been proposed in the literature to predict the risk and/or the rate of accidents on the elements of a road network. However, very few of them have been calibrated in urban contexts. In this paper, we present a simulation procedure for the assessment of the impacts of traffic management measures on urban road safety. The procedure consists of two main modules: the former aiming at the estimation of traffic flow on links and at junctions, the latter estimating by means of performance functions of urban road safety, the accident frequency on each element of the network given the average daily traffic flows. Specification and calibration results of road safety functions based on data gathered in the urban area of Rome (Italy) are presented. Preliminary applications of the procedure to the case study are discussed.

Whilst there are numerous policy options available for managing urban traffic their air quality implications at the city scale are largely unknown. This paper presents preliminary results from the application of a chain of dynamic simulation models of traffic flow (SATURN, SATTAX), pollutant emission (ROADFAC) and dispersion (ADMS-Urban), integrated within a geographic information system model (TEMMS) to assess the impact of alternative transport scenarios on air quality for the city of Leeds, UK. The scenarios addressed include "business as usual" traffic growth to 2015; network development; road pricing with cordon charging; road pricing with distance charging; and the wider adoption of clean fuel vehicle technology. The impact of these developments on air quality (nitrogen dioxide, particulates and sulphur dioxide), including exceedence of air quality standards is identified. Finally, differences in the spatial distribution of air quality (as NO2) between scenarios are highlighted, in light of their significance to social equity concerns.

The project Emissions and Congestion investigated this relationship by simultaneously measuring traffic conditions and emissions. Emission factors were derived for different traffic conditions on motorways, ranging from free flow to heavy congestion. The results clearly indicate that there are significant differences in emissions and fuel consumption for different types of traffic flow. Heavy traffic dynamics, shortcut traffic, heavy congestion and high speeds lead to significant increases of regulated emissions and fuel consumption of motorway traffic. Efforts to reduce congestion and traffic dynamics (by traffic management measures) should be concentrated on specific routes or sections with frequent occurrence of heavy congestion and a large share of heavy duty traffic. These are the motorways in the conurbations. Tens of percents of reduction in emissions are possible. The resulting improvements on local air quality can be significant. Lowering the speed limit to 100 km/h on all sections of Dutch motorways can significantly improve emission levels (most of Dutch motorways have a speed limit of 120 km/h).

Moreover, a traffic simulator was used to simulate observed traffic flows and to evaluate proposed strategies. It was found that temperature-inversion above the road surface due to vehicle exhaust emissions might suppress the vertical dispersion of air pollutants in the early morning. It was also found that concentrations of air pollutants at the roadside near traffic lights had periodicity corresponding to the traffic signal cycle. But the phase of nitrogen dioxide concentration was different from that of suspended particulate matter. It was found that total traffic volume depended mainly on the number of small car, but level of air pollution along the roadside seemed to depend on mainly on the number of heavy-goods vehicles. A vehicle-actuated signal-control system that enables reduction of the air pollution level at the roadside is proposed.

Urban growth is accompanied by increased highway traffic which is a major contributor to noise pollution. Control laws and management rarely accompany the noise pollution growth. The Greater Tehran Metropolitan Area, GTMA, inhabitants along major highways are being continuously exposed to severe traffic noise health hazards. The objective of this research was to evaluate and model noise pollution due to highway traffic in the GTMA. The study database consisted of relevant information about the noise level, traffic, roadway and meteorological characteristics. The collected noise level information at the roadway sound level meter receptor site included equivalent noise level. The traffic information included traffic flows, traffic speed and composition. The roadway information included number of lanes, median type, roadway functional and location types. The meteorological information included air temperature. The univariate statistical analysis of the database shed some lights on the GTMA noise pollution. The noise level measured at reception points along the GTMA highways was found often in breach of noise standards. The noise level was found significantly correlated with distance from the roadway, traffic conditions, roadway conditions and local weather characteristics. The stepwise multiple regression analysis was used to develop highway noise level descriptive models. These models proved to be simple tools for noise level prediction and management. Although the study findings are for the GTMA and problem specific, the same methodology can be applied in any urban transportation noise pollution study.

In a microscopic noise model for urban areas both the noise sources and the noise propagation have to be modeled. The main objective of our study was the integration of a very detailed traffic microsimulation model (HUTSIM) with an accurate and commonly used model of noise dispersion (Nordic Traffic Noise Computing Model). This integration enables more accurate estimations of traffic noise in changing situations in urban areas. The use of computer simulation rather than case studies or physical models should provide a greater degree of reliability and flexibility to the results achieved. This study is a part of the DIANA-project (Development of Integrated Air Pollution Modeling Systems for Urban Planning), where the aim is to create a model that would be accurate in modeling urban air quality and its changes depending on the traffic situation. The noise study is made at HUT in cooperation with the Laboratory of Transportation Engineering and the Department of Environmental Sciences at University of Kuopio. The microsimulation model used in this study is HUTSIM which is developed at Helsinki University of Technology. The results are analyzed by using graphs produced by HUTSIM-analyzer. The approach of developed noise distribution model is macroscopic and the main input parameters are speed limit, traffic flow and the distribution of vehicles. The results were calculated in the application phase. Dividing each approach and departure direction at the intersection area in smaller, ten metres, elements carries out the observation of traffic at the intersections. Each of these elements is then studied separately by using the Nordic Traffic Noise Computing Model. The main benefit of the developed method is that more accurate information is obtained of the traffic situation.

We study the algebraic relationship between models with the Lagrange form and the Euler form of Burger's CA, which is constructed from Burger's equation using the ultradiscrete method. It is found that the Lagrange form has made the description of traffic flow in one lane simpler. Thus we have extended a simple Lagrange model to include the effects of inertia of cars and drivers' perspective. The extended model shows metastable states and complex phase transition from a free to congested state, which is similar to the observed data for expressways.

J	Baaj, MH; El-Fadel, M; Shazbak, SM; Saliby, E				Baaj, MH; El-Fadel, M; Shazbak, SM; Saliby, E			Modeling noise at elevated highways in urban areas: A practical application	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE			English	Article								Traffic noise along highways is continuously increasing; with the projected growth in future traffic use, particularly near developing urban areas, it will not cease to increase. As a result, highway noise impacts are expected to be significant and mitigation strategies will undoubtedly be required. This paper presents a noise impact analysis along a coastal stretch of highway that forms the major entrance into the greater Beirut metropolitan area. Geometric layout includes a proposed 13 km elevated highway-viaduct with underlying service roads running parallel to an existing 4 X 4-lane highway currently accommodating an average daily traffic (ADT) volume of about 160,000 vehicles per day. The proposed viaduct is planned to be a BOT (build-operate-transfer) project and thus includes two toll plazas and three interchanges. Traffic flow characteristics including volumes, vehicular classification, and travel speeds were defined along the proposed coastal highway. Sensitive noise receptors were identified and noise measurements were taken during the noisiest periods. The FHWA traffic noise model was used to simulate base year and future noise exposure of adjacent land uses. The model was calibrated using the combination of field measurements and model predictions. Noise mitigation strategies were defined as well as the locations where they were deemed appropriate. The model was used to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed mitigation measures in satisfying absolute and relative noise-abatement criteria. Finally, the feasibility of implementation of relevant mitigation measures is discussed within the site-specific constraints.

J	Krbalek, M; Seba, P; Wagner, P				Krbalek, M; Seba, P; Wagner, P			Headways in traffic flow: Remarks from a physical perspective	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							MODEL; STATES	Traffic flow can be understood as a realization of a broad class of one dimensional physical systems, where a hard core repulsive interaction competes with a longer ranged attraction between the particles. It can be shown rigorously that the statistical properties of such systems in thermal equilibrium are well described by a family of distributions that stems from the random matrix theory. Analyzing the traffic data from different sources, we show that traffic on real roads belongs to that class of random matrix distributions. Also, various traffic simulation models show a similar behavior. It is demonstrated in such a way that the headway distribution of a highway traffic, that serves usually as a paradigm of systems driven far from equilibrium, is reasonably well described by a distribution originating from equilibrium statistical physics.

The update rules of velocity of a car depend not only on the positions of this car and the car ahead of it. but also on the velocities of the two cars. Using computer simulations we obtain some basic qualitative results and the fundamental diagram of the proposed model. In comparison with those of the existing models in the literature. we find that the fundamental diagram of the proposed model is more consistent with the results measured in the real traffic. and the model is able to reproduce some relevant macroscopic states that are found in the real traffic flow but cannot be predicted by the existing models.

It also presents a freeway Origin-Destination demand prediction algorithm using an adaptive Kalman Filtering technique, where the effect of travel time information on users' route diversion behavior has been explicitly modeled using a dynamic, aggregate, route diversion model. The inherent dynamic nature of the traffic flow characteristics is captured using a Kalman Filter modeling framework. Changes in drivers' perceptions, as well as other randomness in the route diversion behavior, have been modeled using an adaptive, aggregate, dynamic linear model where the model parameters are updated on-line using a Bayesian updating approach. The impact of route diversion on freeway Origin-Destination demands has been integrated in the estimation framework. The proposed methodology is evaluated using data obtained from a microscopic traffic simulator, INTEGRATION. Experimental results on a freeway corridor in northwest Indiana establish that significant improvement in Origin-Destination demand prediction can be achieved by explicitly accounting for route diversion behavior.

The fleet average emission factors for each vehicle category was estimated from US EPA MOBILE 5 A guidelines as a function of speed, vehicle deterioration rates and model years. 1-h CO concentrations and worst case 8-h levels have been simulated and compared with measured readings. This study used model-simulated rooftop concentration levels from non-localized sources as background levels at the two sites. The resulting CO concentrations correlate well with actual measured levels and provide a unique approach to predict the impact of CO from transportation. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Nagel, K; Rickert, M				Nagel, K; Rickert, M			Parallel implementation of the TRANSIMS micro-simulation	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						traffic simulation; parallel computing; transportation planning; TRANSIMS	MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION; TRAFFIC FLOW; PERFORMANCE; MODEL	This paper describes the parallel implementation of the TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System (TRANSIMS) traffic micro-simulation. The parallelization method is domain decomposition, which means that each CPU of the parallel computer is responsible for a different geographical area of the simulated region. We describe how information between domains is exchanged, and how the transportation network graph is partitioned. An adaptive scheme is used to optimize load balancing. We then demonstrate how computing speeds of our parallel micro-simulations can be systematically predicted once the scenario and the computer architecture are known. This makes it possible, e.g., to decide if a certain study is feasible with a certain computing budget, and how to invest that budget. The main ingredients of the prediction are knowledge about the parallel implementation of the micro-simulation, knowledge about the characteristics of the partitioning of the transportation network graph, and knowledge about the interaction of these quantities with the computer system. In particular, we investigate the differences between switched and non-switched topologies, and the effects of 10 Mbit, 100 Mbit, and Gbit Ethernet. As an example, we show that with a common technology - 100 Mbit switched Ethernet one can run the 20 000-link EMME/2-network for Portland (Oregon) more than 20 times faster than real time on 16 coupled Pentium CPUs.

These probability-based models can fit traffic flow well under ideal physical environments but may not work satisfactory in certain complex cases because of their strict mathematical assumptions. A neural network-based system identification approach is used to establish an auto-adaptive model for simulating traffic flow dispersion. This model, being feasible to a wide variety of traffic circumstances, can be calibrated and used for on-line traffic flow forecasting. Data simulation and field-testing show reliable performance of the proposed intelligent approach. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, HJ				Chen, HJ			A varied form of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS B			English	Article							CAR ACCIDENTS; 2-LANE	By making slight changes of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, we propose a varied model for a realistic description of the traffic flow on single-lane highways. While the NaSch model falls to cover the "takeover", this realistic situation gets a good description in our model. Moreover, from the fundamental diagrams achieved in our model, we can divide the forms of traffic flow into five different modes, which are obviously observed in their corresponding time-space diagrams. We also make a comparison of the results of a simple kind of mean-field approximation and the cellular automaton approach.

These are intended to restore the safety performance of sites to which they are applied to prevailing levels according to their kind, traffic flows and design. This approach is, therefore, appropriate to sites where the mean accident frequency exceeds a standard value for that site. In this paper, we present several analyses that provide quantitative but uncertain indications of which sites should be considered for this kind of treatment according to their accident record. We describe four measures that are informative in this respect - the count of accidents, an estimate of the mean accident frequency, the amount by which this estimate exceeds a standard value, and the probability that it does so. We illustrate the use of these analyses by applying them to a dataset of accident records of priority controlled road junctions and compare the results of using the different measures.

Our contribution focuses on the effect of braking probability (P) and a maximum velocity (nu (max)) on the density, flow and average velocity of cars moving in the middle of the road. The phase diagram is presented for nu (max) = 1 and nu (max) > 1. The maximal flow phase does not occur for nu (max) > 1. in contrast with the case nu (max) = 1 where this phase appears for p not equal 0. The first-order transition arises at alpha = beta(alpha < beta) for nu (max) = 1 (nu (max) > 1), where alpha and beta denote, respectively, the inside rate and the outside rate. The mean field approximation gives a good results in comparison with simulations for nu (max) > 1, while for nu (max) = 1, the phase diagram obtained from the simulations is predicted by the mean field approximation when p --> 1.

J	Sasoh, A				Sasoh, A			Nonlinear stability of optimal velocity traffic flow model to unsteady disturbance	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						traffic flow; optimal velocity model; relaxation time; nonlinear stability; unsteady disturbance		Nonlinear stability to unsteady disturbance of an optimal velocity traffic flow model is investigated. The single-lane traffic flow behavior is numerically simulated based on the car-following scheme. Two kinds of the leading car motion are examined as the prescribed disturbance: The first one is stop-and-go motion; the strength of the disturbance is controlled with the duration time of the stop. The second one is deceleration-and-acceleration at a constant rate; the strength is controlled both by the rate and the duration period. Resulting stability is summarized in diagrams on coordinates characterizing the disturbance and relaxation performance. For a large car separation, there exists a metastable state, in which the stability of the system depends on the strength of the disturbance. The critical relaxation time to the metastable state depends on the initial car separation.

J	Chen, H; Grant-Muller, S				Chen, H; Grant-Muller, S			Use of sequential learning for short-term traffic flow forecasting	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						neural networks; sequential learning; resource allocating network (RAN); dynamic model; motorway; traffic forecasting; incidents; inter-urban data	NEURAL NETWORKS	Accurate short-term traffic flow forecasting has become a crucial step in the overall goal of better road network management. Previous research [H. Kirby, M. Dougherty, S. Watson, Should we use neural networks or statistical models for short term motorway traffic forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting 13 (1997) 43-50.] has demonstrated that a straightforward application of neural networks can be used to forecast traffic flows along a motorway link. The objective of this paper is to report on the application and performance of an alternative neural computing algorithm which involves 'sequential or dynamic learning' of the traffic flow process. Our initial work [H. Chen, S. Clark, M.S. Dougherty, S.M. Grant-Muller, Investigation of network performance prediction, Report on Dynamic Neural Network and Performance Indicator development, Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds Technical Note 418, 1998 (unpublished)] was based on simulated data (generated using a Hermite polynomial with random noise) that had a profile similar to that of traffic flows in real data. This indicated the potential suitability of dynamic neural networks with traffic flow data. Using the Kalman filter type network an initial application with M25 motorway flow data suggested that a percentage absolute error (PAE) of approximately 9.5% could be achieved for a network with five hidden units (compared with 11% for the static neural network model). Three different neural networks were trained with all the data (containing an unknown number of incidents) and secondly using data wholly obtained around incidents. Results showed that from the three different models, the 'simple dynamic model' with the first five units fixed (and subsequent hidden units distributed amongst these) had the best forecasting performance. Comparisons were also made of the networks' performance on data obtained around incidents. More detailed analysis of how the performance of the three networks changed through a single day (including an incident) showed that the simple dynamic model again outperformed the other two networks in all time periods. The use of 'piecewise' models (i.e. where a different model is selected according to traffic flow conditions) for data obtained around incidents highlighted good performance again by the simple dynamic network. This outperformed the standard Kalman filter neural network for a medium-sized network and is our overall recommendation for any future application. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Jin, X; Srinivasan, D; Cheu, RL				Jin, X; Srinivasan, D; Cheu, RL			Classification of freeway traffic patterns for incident detection using constructive probabilistic neural networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						incident detection; model adaptation; network pruning; probabilistic neural network (PNN)		This paper proposes a new technique for freeway incident detection using a constructive probabilistic neural network. Incident detection is one of the important components in Intelligent Transportation Systems. It identifies traffic abnormality based on input signals obtained from traffic flow sensors. To date, the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems has urged the researchers in incident detection area to explore new techniques with high adaptability to changing site traffic characteristics. Recent works show that the basic probabilistic neural network is one of the best choices for this purpose. However, it suffers from high memory requirement and the lack of practical model adaptation and network pruning methods. Recent work in probabilistic neural network (PNN) research has led to the development of constructive probabilistic neural network (CPNN), which incorporates a clustering technique with an automated training process. CPNN has been presented in this paper to solve two problems in traffic network incident detection. The work reported in this paper was conducted on Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) in Singapore for incident detection model development, and subsequently on I-880 freeway in California. for model adaptation. The developed model achieved incident detection performance of 92.00% detection rate and 0.81% false alarm rate on AYE, and 91.30% detection rate and 0.27% false alarm rate on 1-880 freeway using the proposed adaptation method. In addition to its superior performance, the network pruning method employed here facilitated remarkable model size reduction by a factor of 11 compared to a conventional probabilistic neural network. A more impressive size reduction by a factor of 50 was achieved after the model was adapted for the new site. The results from this paper suggest that CPNN is a better adaptive classifier for incident detection problem with a changing site traffic environment.

J	Johnson, L; Ferreira, L				Johnson, L; Ferreira, L			Modelling particle emissions from traffic flows at a freeway in Brisbane, Australia	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						submicrometer particles; traffic flows; multilinear regression models; air quality		The health risks of exposure to submicrometer particles (those with an aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than I tm) from vehicle exhaust, have led to a need to develop new models to predict likely levels of emissions from traffic flows. The lack of vehicle emissions factors for PM, has been a limiting factor to-date. Researchers in Australia have been looking for a simple technique to predict levels of submicrometer particles contributed by traffic flows at the roadway. Work has focussed on examining the relationship between submicrometer particle number concentrations and size distributions in relation to traffic volume, fleet composition, congestion, fuel usage and meteorological conditions. A technique has been developed to predict ambient submicrometer particle concentrations from traffic flows at a freeway site with up to 75% accuracy. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The traffic status of the crossroads is controlled by a set of traffic lights which periodically switch to red and green with a total period of T. Two different types of crossroads are discussed. The first one describes the intersection of two one-way streets, while the second type models the intersection of a two-way street with all one-way street. We assume that the vehicles approach the crossroads with constant rates in time which are taken as the model parameters. We optimize the traffic flow at the crossroads by minimizing the total waiting time of the vehicles per cycle of the traffic light. This leads to the determination of the optimum green-time allocated to each phase.

J	Beuthe, M; Jourquin, B; Geerts, JF; Ha, CKAN				Beuthe, M; Jourquin, B; Geerts, JF; Ha, CKAN			Freight transportation demand elasticities: a geographic multimodal transportation network analysis	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART E-LOGISTICS AND TRANSPORTATION REVIEW			English	Article						elasticity; freight transport; GIS; network	SHORTEST-PATH ALGORITHMS; COMPETITION; CANADA; MODEL	This paper presents direct and cross-elasticity estimates of the demands for three freight transportation modes: rail, road and inland waterways. They are computed for 10 different categories of goods with a detailed multimodal network model of Belgian freight transports. The model, which minimises the generalised cost of transportation tasks defined by O-D matrices, assigns traffic flows to the different modes, transport means and routes. Successive simulations with different relative costs permit the computation of specific are-elasticities. In contrast with the usual methodologies, the present methodology is not based on a statistical analysis of disaggregate data on actual modal choices and transport tariffs. This is a particularly useful feature since such data are mostly not: available for freight transports in Europe. Furthermore, it fully takes into account the detailed characteristics of the network, all available routes and combinations of modes, as well as the specific localisation of activities within the network. Its estimates are compared with previously published estimates, and, in particular, with Abdelwahab's results published (1998) in this journal. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Al-Ghamdi, AS				Al-Ghamdi, AS			Analysis of time headways on urban roads: Case study from Riyadh	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The headway between vehicles in a traffic stream is of fundamental importance in traffic engineering applications. Previous research in this subject has focused on modeling theoretical distributions for low and medium traffic flow conditions. Yet little research has studied congested traffic conditions-that is, the high traffic flow state. In the same context, there appears to be a lack of clear-cut boundaries for the three flow states (low, medium, and high). This study attempts to determine such boundaries on the basis of traffic conditions observed at the study sites. Although observed headways at arterial sites follow a gamma distribution, distributions that fit freeway headways differ according to the traffic flow state. The Erlang distribution provided a good fit to the observed headways at sites with high traffic flows.

In this study, data were collected on traffic flows, second-by-second CO and NO2 ambient concentrations in Shanghai, China. The sampled data were compared with CAL3QHC modeling results. We found that: (1) intersection hot spot emission concentrations were explained primarily by queuing activities of motor vehicles; (2) air quality concentrations are difficult to predict because of complex dispersion processes near high-rise buildings; and (3) screening models such as CAL3QHC are prone to large errors in dense cities with mixed traffic and high-rising buildings. Suggestions are made for improved models relevant to dense developing cities. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is a nu (max) = 1 model with exclusion statistics and parallel dynamics. Long-range interactions between the pedestrians are mediated by a so-called floor field which modifies the transition rates to neighbouring cells. This field, which can be discrete or continuous, is subject to diffusion and decay. Furthermore it can be modified by the motion of the pedestrians. Therefore, the model uses an idea similar to chemotaxis, but with pedestrians following a virtual rather than a chemical trace, Our main goal is to show that the introduction of such a floor field is sufficient to model collective effects and self-organization encountered in pedestrian dynamics, e.g. lane formation in counterflow through a large corridor. As an application we also present simulations of the evacuation of a large room with reduced visibility, e.g. due to failure of lights or smoke. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The traffic on the BUS is divided into two classes: the broadcast and multicast traffic, and the unicast relay flow, The broadcast and multicast traffic is assumed to form a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP). The traffic for a particular unicast relay flow is an MMPP as well. However, the number of active unicast relay flows sojourning on the BUS is determined by a tandem queueing system, where the flow arrival process is Poisson, the address resolution delay is exponentially distributed, and the connection setup delay is three-stage Erlang distributed. The size of data frames in traffic flows is a random variable with three possibile values: short, medium, and large. In order to deal with the intractability (i.e., largeness and stiffness) of the underlying Markov chain, a hierarchical model is used to decompose the system, With the help of Stochastic Petri Net Package (SPNP), a software package for the automated genaration and solution of Markovian stochastic systems, and the decomposition method, we study the performance of the BUS module under different toads. We also investigate the effect of address resolution delay and conection setup delay on the performance of the BUS.

J	Montero, L; Codina, E; Barcelo, J; Barcelo, P				Montero, L; Codina, E; Barcelo, J; Barcelo, P			A combined methodology for transportation planning assessment. Application to a case study	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						transportation planning; microscopic simulation; graphical interfaces; motorway assesment		Traffic assignment models based on the user-equilibrium approach are one of the most widely used tools in transportation planning analysis. Resulting flows offer a static average view of the expected use of the road infrastructure under the modeling hypothesis. This information has usually been enough for the planning decisions. The planned infrastructure is probably sufficient for average demand, but time-varying traffic flows, i.e., at peak periods, combined with the influence of road geometry, can produce undesired congestion that can not be forecasted or analysed with the static tools. There is a clear case for a change in the analysis methodology such as combination of a traffic assignment tool, with a microscopic traffic simulator. This paper illustrates, by means of a case study, the combination of a well-known traffic assignment tool, the EMME/2 model, with a microscopic traffic simulator, Advanced interactive Microscopic Simulator For Urban And Non-Urban Networks (AIMSUN2) with emphasis on the description of the specific interfaces that make consistent the combination of both tools in the Generic Environment fur Traffic Analysis and Modeling (GETRAM) environment. Models for complex transportation systems should be the combination of mathematical models and computer models, to overcome, for example, the difficulties of the integration of modeling tools. GETRAM environment has an open and flexible computer architecture suitable for such purposes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our investigations concentrate on the so-called VDR model which is a simple generalization of the well-known Nagel-Schreckenberg model. In the VDR model one finds a separation between a free flow phase and jammed vehicles. This phase separation allows to use random walk like arguments to predict the resolving probabilities and lifetimes of jam clusters or disturbances. These predictions are in good agreement with the results of computer simulations and even become exact for a special case of the model. Our findings allow a deeper insight into the dynamics of wide jams occuring in the model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B,V. All lights reserved.

J	Baglietto, M; Parisini, T; Zoppoli, R				Baglietto, M; Parisini, T; Zoppoli, R			Distributed-information neural control: The case of dynamic routing in traffic networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS			English	Article						distributed-information organizations; neural control; optimal routing; team optimal control; traffic and communication networks	NONLINEAR STOCHASTIC-SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATION-NETWORKS; APPROXIMATION	Large-scale traffic networks (e.g., computer and communication networks, freeway systems, etc.) can be modeled as graphs in which a set of nodes (with storing capacities) are connected through a set of links (where traffic delays and transport costs may be incurred) that cannot be loaded above their traffic capacities. Traffic flows may vary over time. Then the nodes (i.e., the decision makers acting at the nodes) may be requested to modify the traffic flows to be sent to their neighboring nodes. In this case, a dynamic routing problem arises. The decision makers are realistically assumed 1) to generate their routing decisions on the basis of local information and possibly of some data received from other nodes, typically, the neighboring ones and 2) to cooperate on the accomplishment of a common goal, that is, the minimization of the total traffic cost. Therefore, they can be regarded as the cooperating members of informationally distributed organizations, which, in control engineering and economics, are called team organizations. Team optimal control problems cannot be solved analytically unless special assumptions on the team model are verified. In general, this is not the case with traffic networks. An approximate resolutive method is then proposed, in which each decision maker is assigned a fixed-structure routing function where some parameters have to be optimized. Among the various possible fixed-structure functions, feedforward neural networks have been chosen for their powerful approximation capabilities. The routing functions can also be computed (or adapted) locally at each node. Concerning traffic networks, we focus attention on store-and-forward packet switching networks, which exhibit the essential peculiarities and difficulties of other traffic networks.

J	de Donato, SR; Morri, B				de Donato, SR; Morri, B			Technical note: A statistical model for predicting road traffic noise based on Poisson type traffic flow	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								A new prediction model for A-weighted equivalent level produced by road traffic is presented. It is based on the supposition that the distribution of vehicles on the road is describable using a Poisson distribution and that vehicle sound emission is nondirectional (monopole). These conditions are realized if the traffic flow is lower than about 600 vehicles/h and vehicle speed is higher than 8.3 m/s. Equations are supplied for application of the model to one and two lane roads. The error associated with the proposed model has been calculated using a classical propagation of errors approach. A series of measurements have been carried out on different roads to verify the model. The relationship between the calculated and measured data has been quantified using a linear regression with a resulting correlation coefficient of 0.98. An extension of the model is proposed to include situations when the vehicles move at a speed slower than about 8.3 m/s. In such situations the noise emission of a single vehicle is supposed to be directional in line with the direction of motion (dipole). A comparison between monopole and dipole models is presented for some example cases. (C) 2001 Institute of Noise Control Engineering.

J	Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL				Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL			Generic gas-kinetic traffic systems modeling with applications to vehicular traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								This article presents a generic continuum modeling approach for the description of flow operations for a general class of traffic systems. That is, the traffic flow model presented in this paper models traffic flows independently of the type of traffic (vehicular traffic on motorways or rural roads, pedestrian flows). Key to the approach is the introduction of the so-called generalized phase-space density (g-PSD). This density concept is a generalization of traffic density with respect to both discrete attibutes, such as user-class, roadway lane, and destination, and continuous attributes, such as velocity, and desired velocity. In the approach, we distinguish continuum and non-continuum processes. The continuum processes reflect smooth changes in the g-PSD, while the non-continuum processes describe non-smooth changes in the g-PSD. These non-continuum processes are either caused by events experienced by a traffic entity, or by the condition of a traffic entity. To show the potential of this new and powerful modeling framework, a simple model specification example for platoon-based description of traffic flow is presented. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This scheme is an extension of Godunov's scheme to systems. It utilizes the solutions of a series of Riemann problems at cell boundaries to construct approximate solutions of the non-equilibrium traffic flow model under general initial conditions. Moreover, the Riemann solutions at both left (upstream) and right (downstream) boundaries of a highway allow the specification of correct boundary conditions using state variables (e.g., density and/or speed) rather than fluxes. Preliminary numerical results indicate that the finite difference scheme correctly computes entropy-satisfying weak solutions of the original model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The model implemented a rule-based visualization module that automatically constructs the collision diagram according to traffic flow conflicts, where accident characteristics can be analyzed either individually or collectively. A data acquisition module was developed for accessing accident databases maintained in state transportation and public safety departments. Using a local database management system as part of the model, the user can select to analyze any accident data through Structured Query Language statements. In addition, this model has implemented a data analysis and graphing module for comparing similarities and identifying differences in accident data and for presenting the results of the analysis through charts and tables. The model was tested with accident data obtained from the Ohio Department of Public Safety in a number of scenario studies, and some of them were presented in this paper as examples. Because the model is very time efficient and user friendly, it can be developed into an effective engineering tool for field applications.

We present a concept for online simulations of traffic in road networks: real-time traffic data stemming from inductive loops serve as input for high-speed microsimulations using a cellular automaton traffic flow model. The quality of the reproduced traffic states is investigated with regard to vehicular densities and link travel times. As an example for dynamic traffic management we studied different strategies for individual en-route guidance systems and their efficiencies. For all investigations the road network of Duisburg served as the study area. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Huang, CS				Huang, CS			Structural identification from ambient vibration measurement using the multivariate AR model	JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION			English	Article							SYSTEM-IDENTIFICATION; MODAL PARAMETERS	A procedure for identifying the dynamic characteristics of a structural system using the multivariate AR (ARV) model is presented in the paper. A least-squares approach to determine the coefficient matrices of the ARV model is proposed, which is a modification of the traditional one. The modification is based on the equivalence between the correlation function matrix for the responses of a linear system subjected to white-noise input and the deterministic free vibration responses of the system. Then, the dynamic characteristics of the system are evaluated directly from the coefficient matrices of the ARV model by adopting the concept behind Ibrahim's system identification technique. The superiority of the proposed procedure over the traditional one is demonstrated through numerical studies on a six-story shear building. Finally, the present identification procedure is applied to identify the dynamic characteristics of a three-span highway bridge from its ambient vibration responses subjected to traffic flow. The validity of the present procedure is confirmed by the excellent agreement between the identified results obtained in the present study and those obtained from an impulse test.

J	Xue, Y; Dong, LY; Dai, SQ				Xue, Y; Dong, LY; Dai, SQ			An improved one-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow and the effect of deceleration probability	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton; probability of deceleration; jam phase		Based upon the single-lane traffic cellular automaton (CA) model introduced by Negel and Schreckenberg, an improved single-lane traffic CA model has been proposed by the consideration of the relative motion of vehicles and the relation of deceleration probability with the density. Numerical simulations have been carried out. The results show the complicated evolution process of traffic flow. The flow of vehicles can be controlled by the definition of the relation between deceleration probability and the exponet v of density P-noise similar to rho (v) Different values of v have different effect on the critical point from free phase to jam phase. The simulation agrees with the measurement as v is about 0.75. With the increase of vehicles and the evolution process of traffic flow,the free and jam phases will become unsteady and appear alternatively, similiar to the propagation of wave.

The efficiency of even microscopic simulation models is high enough to allow for reproducing the flow of whole networks in multiple real time. The derails of the car motion have to be defined very carefully in order to yield the correct traffic states in various situations, e.g., bottlenecks, intersections and on- and off-ramps. In this paper the current status of the work in this field is reported acid the application to the road network of the downtown area of Duisburg is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The risks caused by snow and ice, volcanic eruptions and lahars, earthquakes, and traffic accidents were evaluated in terms of their expected frequency of occurrence and duration of road closure. The effects of road closures on traffic flow patterns were assessed using a traffic assignment model, with and without allowing for the elasticity of travel demand. A probability distribution for the annual economic impact of road closure was found for each hazard. The viability of various mitigation options for reducing the risk of road closure was assessed, using probability distributions of the benefit-cost ratio for the mitigation options.

J	Blue, VJ; Adler, JL				Blue, VJ; Adler, JL			Cellular automata microsimulation for modeling bi-directional pedestrian walkways	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						pedestrians; cellular automata; microsimulation; simulation modeling; traffic flow theory	SIMULATION	Pedestrian flow is inherently complex, more so than vehicular flow, and development of microscopic models of pedestrian flow has been a daunting task for researchers, This paper presents the use of Cellular automata (CA) microsimulation for modeling bi-directional pedestrian walkways. It is shown that a small rule set is capable of effectively capturing the behaviors of pedestrians at the micro-level while attaining realistic macro-level activity. The model provides fur simulating three modes of bi-directional pedestrian flow: (a) flows in directionally separated lanes, (b) interspersed flow, and (c) dynamic multi-lane (DML) flow. The emergent behavior that arises from the model, termed CA-Ped, is consistent with well-established fundamental properties. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Joyce, TL; Mahoney, SP				Joyce, TL; Mahoney, SP			Spatial and temporal distributions of moose-vehicle collisions in Newfoundland	WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN			English	Article						Alces alces; density; human injury; moose-vehicles collisions; Newfoundland; spatial; temporal; traffic volume	SUMMER; REFLECTORS; ACCIDENTS; SIZE	In Newfoundland, 5,422 moose-vehicle collisions (MVCs) occurred between 1988 and 1994, resulting in 14 human and approximately 4,800 moose (Alces alces) fatalities. We examined daily, seasonal, and spatial distribution patterns of MVCs and used log-linear modeling to assess effects of darkness, posted speed limits, road condition, vehicle occupants, and road alignment on severity of human injury resulting from such collisions. Seventy-five percent of all MVCs occurred between dusk and dawn. We found no differences among diurnal patterns of MVCs involving moose of different sex and age groups. Seasonally, 70% of MVCs occurred between lune and October and peak accident periods differed somewhat among moose age classes (calf, yearling, adult). However, we found no seasonal differences between males and females. Spatially, MVCs were dependent on moose densities and traffic volume, with greater probability of MVCs in areas of high or low (but not moderate) moose densities and high traffic flow. Risk of severe human injury was 2.0 times greater at highway speeds ranging from 80 to 100 km/hour and 2.1 times greater at night. Human injuries were more severe for MVCs occurring when road conditions were dry and when passengers were present. We found no relationship between road alignment and injury severity, although 79% of MVCs occurred on straight sections of highway. The predominant influence of darkness on MVCs may result from low light conditions and increased movement of moose at night. The high occurrence of MVCs under dry road conditions and on straight sections of road was surprising and may indicate inadequate driver attention to potential road hazards. We suggest that a long-term driver education program may be the only viable mitigation effort available to reduce number of MVCs.

We provide direct empirical evidence that a phase transition between a free flow and a congested phase occurring in traffic flow on highways in the vicinity of on- and off-ramps can be interpreted as an example of such a boundary-induced phase transition of first order. We analyse the empirical traffic data and give a theoretical interpretation of the transition in terms of the macroscopic current. Additionally we support the theory with computer simulations of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model of vehicular traffic on a road segment which also exhibits the expected second-order transition.

J	Setchell, C; Dagless, EL				Setchell, C; Dagless, EL			Vision-based road-traffic monitoring sensor	IEE PROCEEDINGS-VISION IMAGE AND SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							MODEL; RECOGNITION	Current techniques for road-traffic monitoring rely on sensors that have limited capabilities and are often both costly and disruptive to install. The use of video cameras (many of which are already installed to survey road networks), coupled with computer vision techniques, offers an attractive alternative to current sensors. Vision-based sensors have the potential to measure a greater variety of traffic parameters (e.g. entry/exit statistics, journey times and incident detection) while installation and maintenance may be performed without disruption to traffic flow. Work on a model based approach for locating vehicles in images of complex road scenes is presented. The location of the vehicle in the image is transformed to the vehicle's position and orientation in the real world while the deformable vehicle model allows the vehicle's principal dimensions to be measured. This data may be passed to a high level tracking algorithm to extract traffic parameters such as vehicle speed vehicle count, and junction entry/exit statistics. The principal dimensions may be used to classify the vehicle within categories such as car, van or bus. The system could also be used as a boot-strap process for faster, but perhaps less robust, tracking algorithms. The key features of the system are described and results from testing it on images from real traffic scenes are presented.

J	Boccara, N				Boccara, N			On the existence of a variational principle for deterministic cellular automaton models of highway traffic flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						cellular automata; interacting particles; highway traffic models; variational principle	STATES; RULES	It is shown that a variety of deterministic cellular automaton models of highway traffic flow obey a variational principle which states that, for a given car density, the average car flow is a nondecreasing function of time. This result is established for systems whose configurations exhibits local jams of a given structure. If local jams have a different structure, it is shown that either the variational principle may still apply to systems evolving according to some particular rules, or it could apply under a weaker form to systems whose asymptotic average car flow is a well-defined function of car density. To establish these results, it has been necessary to characterize among all number-conserving cellular automaton rules which ones may reasonably be considered as acceptable traffic rules. Various notions such as free-moving phase, perfect and defective tiles, and local jam play an important role in the discussion. Many illustrative examples are given.

J	Helbing, D; Hennecke, A; Shvetsov, V; Treiber, M				Helbing, D; Hennecke, A; Shvetsov, V; Treiber, M			MASTER: macroscopic traffic simulation based on a gas-kinetic, non-local traffic model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; STATISTICAL-THEORY; FLOW; DERIVATION; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAYS; HIERARCHY; FREEWAYS; STATES	We present a gas-kinetic (Boltzmann-like) traffic equation that is not only suited for low vehicle densities, but also for the high-density regime, as it takes into account the forwardly directed interactions, effects of vehicular space requirements like increased interaction rates: and effects of velocity correlations that reflect the bunching of cars, at least partially. From this gas-kinetic equation, we systematically derive the related macroscopic traffic equations. The corresponding partial differential equations for the vehicle density and average velocity are directly related to the quantities characterizing individual driver-vehicle behavior, and, as we show by calibration of the model, their optimal values have the expected order of magnitude. Therefore: the model allows to investigate the influences of varying street and weather conditions or freeway control measures. We point out that, because of the forwardly directed interactions, the macroscopic equations contain non-local instead of diffusion or viscosity terms. This resolves some of the inconsistencies found in previous models and allows for a fast and robust numerical integration, so that several thousand freeway kilometers can be simulated in real-time. It turns out that the model is in good agreement with the experimentally observed properties of freeway traffic flow. In particular, it reproduces the characteristic outflow and dissolution velocity of traffic jams, as well as the phase transition to "synchronized" congested traffic. We also reproduce the five different kinds of congested states that have been found close to on-ramps (or bottlenecks) and present a "phase diagram" of the different traffic states in dependence of the main flow and the ramp flow, showing that congested states are often induced by perturbations in the traffic flow. Finally, we introduce generalized macroscopic equations for multi-lane and multi-userclass traffic. With these, we investigate the differences between multi-lane simulations and simulations of the effective one-lane model. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The operating period is divided into two parts. There is normal operation where everything is working correctly. These intervals can be studied deterministically by arguments-from-design or by tests. There is unsafe operation where equipment has failed, an error has occurred, or traffic perturbations have produced unusual circumstances. Such stochastic phenomena can be studied by experiments or simulation. These two types of operation create a natural partition. This paper proposes a Monte Carlo method based on this partition that appears appropriate for studying scarce events. Estimators for this method are developed. It is shown they are unbiased, and confidence intervals derived. There is also a discussion of integrating random failures with traffic flow in a discrete event simulation.

This simulator permits analysis of traffic behavior in situations where both microscopic (vehicle-level) and mesoscopic (aggregate flow) effects are important, while avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of microsimulating a large-scale AHS. This paper describes the software structure of the meso-micro simulator, which implements the PATH AHS control architecture [1], [2]. Simulation results indicate that the meso-micro simulator generates consistent traffic flows across both meso and microsimulated regions.

ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), a special neuro-fuzzy architecture, is used to incorporate a hybrid learning procedure into the control system. The traffic responsive metering rate is determined every minute by the neuro fuzzy control algorithm. Coordination between multiple on-ramps is ensured by the integration of a common input into all ramp controllers upstream of a bottleneck and a periodical update of the fuzzy control system every 15 rain. by a hybrid learning procedure. The objective of the online tuning process of the fuzzy parameters is to minimize the total tittle spent (TTS) in the system. Therefore Payne's traffic flow model and a deterministic queuing model are integrated into the control architecture. To assess the impacts of the neuro fuzzy ramp metering algorithm a section of 25 kin of the A9 Autobahn eras simulated with the FREQ model and compared with two outer control scenarios. The results of the simulation of tire neuro Jazzy algorithm are very promising and art implementation of the neuro-fuzzy ramp metering system on Munich's Middle Ring Road within the MOBINET project is planned.

An important property of the earlier model is that it can be solved without the longitudinal discretization of network links, which results in exceptionally fast execution times. The model is further developed here in order to take into account the effects of lane-changing activity, which can result in significant reductions in the effective flow capacity of a section of road. The model presented here accurately captures these reductions in flow, while maintaining the "link-based" nature of the earlier model. The proposed model is unique in its ability to capture the effects of complex interactions with very little computational effort, Simulation results obtained for a small yet challenging example compare very well with those obtained with the AIMSUN2 traffic simulator.

A number of different approaches are available, including macroscopic, mesoscopic and microscopic traffic models, as well as analytical dynamic assignment models. Although microscopic models are the most detailed and realistic, they are difficult to calibrate and may not be the most practical tools for large-scale networks. This paper investigates three methods for dynamic network loading that are considerably less detailed than microscopic modeling. Each of the three methods is based on a different approach to modeling traffic dynamics: link-based travel time functions, the cell-transmission model, and a link-based model derived from a simplified car-following relationship. A small test network was devised and the results from each model were compared to those obtained with a microsimulator (INTEGRATION). Interpretation of the discrepancies observed in the results gave some indication of the relative importance of the different components of the three traffic models presented.

In this paper, we present new concepts that called main urgent phase and minor urgent phase. The traffic data are acquired from the detectors in the intersections and lanes. Based on the concepts of main and minor urgent phase, a set of novel fuzzy control rules is developed to control the phases and delay of traffic lights according to the dynamic characters of some correlative traffic intersections. The new method can reduce the average delay time of vehicles effectively. The method is compared with Jee-Hyong Lee's method by computer simulation, and the results prove that our method can improve the performance significantly especially when the traffic flow is light.

Based on the estimation of the traffic demand and the capacity of long term construction sites and short term maintenance sites, the congestion process is calculated by a macroscopic model. The main attention was given to the investigation of the various factors influencing the capacity of congestion/maintenance sites. The procedure was converted to a computer program which enables on the one hand the consideration of the traffic impacts during the planning phase and on the other hand the providing of traffic information for the travelers.

The impetus for studying this problem has been further strengthened due to the fast growing field of Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS). Therefore, it is critical to investigate and understand the nature of traffic congestion and address questions of the type: how are traffic patterns formed? and how can traffic congestion be alleviated? Understanding drivers' travel times is key behind this problem. In this paper, we present macroscopic models for determining analytical forms for travel times. We take a fluid dynamics approach by noticing that traffic macroscopically behaves like a fluid. Our contributions in this work are the following: (i) We propose two second-order non-separable macroscopic models for analytically estimating travel time functions : the Polynomial Travel Time (PTT) Model and the Exponential Travel Time (ETT) Model. These models generalize the models proposed by Kachani and Perakis [3] as they incorporate second-order effects such as reaction of drivers to upstream and downstream congestion as well as second-order link interaction effects. (ii) Based on piecewise linear and piecewise quadratic approximations of the departure flow rates, we propose different classes of travel time functions for the first-order separable PTT and ETT models, and present the relationship between these functions. (iii) We show how the analysis of the first-order separable PTT Model extends to the second-order model with non-separable velocity functions for acyclic networks. (iv) Finally, we analyze the second-order separable ETT model where the queue propagation term -corresponding to the reaction of drivers to upstream congestion or decongestion- is not neglected. We are able to reduce the analysis to a Burgers equation and then to the more tractable heat equation.

In order to provide network-wide information about the current traffic state a cellular automaton traffic flow model is combined with measured data. The framework is applied to the freeway network of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), where data from about 3,500 inductive loops are available and provided on-line minute by minute. Technical aspects of the simulation like the network structure are illustrated. Furthermore, heuristics are developed based on the statistical analysis of historical data.

The purpose is to operate a comparative evaluation of potentialities and limits in the two different approaches, by applying the models on a large scale motorway network with a complete traffic data base. The two different modelling approaches are: a model based on microscopic traffic theory and a macroscopic stochastic-experimental model. Model performances have been verified comparing some simulation results to the real travel times and traffic flows measured on the network, in non-congested traffic conditions. Travel times of all vehicles from origin to destination have been measured as well as all origin and destination flows by using data from the toll collection system (entrance and exit time for each vehicle). Models potentialities and limits in large-scale applications are also discussed.

VATSIM simulates vehicle with movement, such as lane following, lane changing, vehicle following and intersection stopping, and is able to evaluate different controllers and sensors for vehicles. VATSIM represents traffic networks in detail such that it can also simulate different kinds of traffic flow movement and evaluate the effects of different traffic control methods and routing strategies.

Despite the importance of modeling traffic flows, most of the literature has concentrated on univariate modeling of flow time-series with freeway data. The approach taken in this paper is univariate spectral analysis and cross-spectral analysis of urban traffic flow data. The purpose is to study spectral characteristics of traffic flows and to capture the lead and lag structure of flow between different urban locations. The empirical results suggest that the spectral characteristics of flows vary depending on the time of day, while traffic flows exhibit strong positive autocorrelation. The cross-spectral analysis results indicate strong short-term flow correlation between different locations; this correlation depends on the distance of the points examined.

Microscopic traffic simulators can model traffic flow in a realistic manner and are ideal for agent-based vehicle control. In this paper we describe a model of a reactive agent that is used to control a simulated vehicle. The agent is capable of tactical-level driving and has different driving styles. To ensure fast reaction times, the agent's driving task is divided in several competing and reactive behavior rules. The agent is implemented in and tested with a prototype traffic simulator program. The simulator consists of an urban environment with mufti-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights, and vehicles. Every vehicle is controlled by a driving agent and all agents have individual behavior settings. Preliminary experiments have shown that the agents exhibit human-like behavior ranging from slow and careful to fast and aggressive driving behavior.

The proposed traffic signal system applies the emotional algorithm to determine its motion. The emotional algorithm estimates the emotional value based on the emotional functions, which are defined on the emotional space. The emotional space consists of four factors, "HAPPY," "RELIEF," "AFRAID" and "ANGRY," and provides the emotional states of the system by the value on it. The emotional function imitates the state of driver's mind, and aims at the system not to inflict the psychological stress onto the driver. Moreover, the emotional function achieves the different characteristics of performances, individuality. The individuality of traffic signals can optimize the arrangements of signals. This report proposes the principal architecture of the emotional algorithm with above individual and the traffic signal system simulator using it. The numerical simulations clear the effectiveness of the new emotional algorithm with individuality and show the optimized arrangements of traffic signals. The DEA simulator, of which parameters dynamically change by evaluating the congestion of a road, improves the architecture of traffic signals networks.

As a common traffic phenomenon, following behavior is important in the micro-study of traffic. In consequence, the car-following has been paid great attention. Compared with other traffic-flow models, car-following model embodies the human factors and reflects the real traffic situation in a better way. This paper, which introduces and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of GHR model, OV model, CA model, and fuzzy-logic model in detail, gives a systematic review of the development and actuality of car-following model.

Streets are characterized by their size, direction, number of lanes, etc. Once the urban section is outlined, the constructions are translated into Cell-DEVS models, and the traffic flow is automatically set up. As modelers can focus in the problem to solve, development times for a simulation can be highly reduced. We present an example of application of the the specification language to solve specific problems.

Transportat Res Board				Split phasing can sometimes be more efficient in serving vehicular traffic under certain geometric and traffic flow conditions, such as the case in which a high volume of left-turning traffic is served from a shared-lane configuration. However, pedestrian crossing-time requirements can have a significant impact on intersection operations, especially in coordinated signal systems. Various alternatives for providing pedestrian timings under split-phasing operations are presented. The advantages and disadvantages, implementation strategies, and potential impact on intersection operations, especially on coordinated signal systems, are addressed with regard to each timing alternative. Further, the concept of the two-stage crossing design and the use of an exclusive pedestrian phase under split-phasing operations are investigated. The proposed model can be used to determine when exclusive pedestrian phasing can actually improve operational efficiency.

Transportat Res Board				A generic approach to the problem of optimal coordinated ramp metering control in large-scale motorway networks is described that is implemented In the software tool Advanced Motorway Optimal Control. In this approach, the traffic flow process is modeled by use of a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The overall problem of coordinated ramp metering is formulated as a constrained discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem, and a feasible-direction nonlinear optimization algorithm is employed for its numerical solution. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the 32-km long Amsterdam ring road. A number of different scenarios with regard to the number of controlled ramps and the available storage space are discussed in some detail. The results of the presented approach are very promising and demonstrate the high efficiency and general applicability of the optimal control methodology for motorway traffic control problems.

Transportat Res Board				The efficacy of the driver-initiated incident detection system was assessed by modeling the use of new communications technologies to mitigate problems that beset current cellular call-in programs, problems such as insufficient information on incident location, false reporting, and duplicate calls. Am analytical model supported by field data for several important variables was used to determine the system performance measures, that is, the detection rate, mean time to detect, and false alarm rate. The results indicate that with the implementation of new technologies that lead to the automatic geolocation of the driver initiating an incident call, the driver-initiated detection system is effective. The system achieved good detection rates and faster detection times across all simulated incidents occurring under variable traffic flow rates that ranged from light traffic to congested traffic. For instance, even when the proportion of drivers with cellular phones was 1 out of 10, with only 10 percent of them willing to use their phones to report the incidents, close to 80 percent of the incidents were detected within 2 min. This result is consistent with the results of the field studies and shows that even better detection performance can be achieved if current levels of cellular phone ownership in the United States are considered and if drivers' reporting propensity is raised. It is noteworthy that the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association reported that there was one cellular phone user per two licensed drivers in the United States at the end of 1999.

Some of the questions now understood are the following: Why are vehicles sometimes stopped by so-called "phantom traffic jams", although they all like to drive fast? What axe the mechanisms behind stop-and-go traffic? Why are there several different kinds of congestion, and how axe they related? Why do most traffic jams occur considerably before the road capacity is reached? Can a temporary reduction of the traffic volume cause a lasting traffic jam? Why do pedestrians moving in opposite directions normally organize in lanes, while nervous crowds axe "freezing by heating"? Why do panicking pedestrians produce dangerous deadlocks? All these questions have been answered by applying and extending methods from statistical physics and non-linear dynamics to self-driven many-particle systems.

This County, in the South East of England, was selected for the study as it has one of the highest levels of population density within the United Kingdom, hence elevated levels of car ownership and traffic flow. In addition, there were very few major industrial sources within the County, thus air pollutants were likely to be predominantly caused by traffic. This assumption was confirmed by comparing diurnal patterns of pollution at one location on a typical weekday, and Christmas Day, when the traffic was minimal. A further investigation compared the diurnal patterns of pollution with the levels of traffic provided by the local transportation model. This demonstrated a direct link between the primary pollutant, nitrogen oxide (NO) and traffic volume. The results showed two daily peaks in pollutant levels, which coincided with morning and afternoon 'rush hours'. Similar distributions were also obtained for the other primary pollutants, carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM10), measured at the same monitoring site. The study was then extended to two further locations within Surrey. Both of these were found to produce similar daily distributions of NO and PM10 although the actual magnitude of pollutants varied. Lower values were measured at the background site, due to its distance from the pollutant source.

For the future a growth of traffic load on the existing infrastructure caused by freight transportation is forecasted. To cope this expected volume of traffic the existing infrastructure has to be used more effective. To improve the traffic flow two starting points are possible. A high potential can be expected of an increase of the valid top speed for trucks up to 100 km/h. Increasing the maximum payload per vehicle simultaneously the truck rate of the overall traffic can be reduced conspicuously. This paper exposes the advantages a truck with an increased payload, a "Roadtrain", offers in terms of traffic flow, fuel consumption and environmental impact. A special consideration is put on the design of the powertrain, which was optimized using the traffic simulation tool PELOPS in combination with an evolutionary Algorithm.

We suggest the conditions of strict limitations of maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC) of toxic emissions, levels of vibrations. and noise (MAV and MAN). The direct problem of the theory and conditional monitoring includes the quantitative estimation of fuel consumption and corresponding toxic emissions the level of vibrations and noise for the existing vehicles fleet. The inverse problem of the theory includes the calculation of the required perfection of technical and energy - ecological parameters of individual or all types of vehicles forming the traffic flows. The direct problem solving methodology includes imitation modeling of traffic flows on urban networks with differentiation of kinds of vehicles, diffusion toxic emissions into the air etc. Optimization is achieved on the basis of percolation analysis of urban territory, considering traffic simulation on network and speed - load operating conditions of automobile engines. The optimal efficiency criterion is the best suited for solving the inverse, problem which is linked, in particular with term chemical reforming of automobile bile fuels assuring the decrease of its Butlerov number due to addition of-a component H2. Conclusions. A new theory and practice of modeling and monitoring the traffic flows on urban territory has been developed which provides the solution of direct and inverse problem assuring that MAC, MAV, MAN and others MA of ecological parameters, as well as required reduction of CO2 emissions.

Driver Assistant Systems have been developed in order to support drivers to fulfill these tasks. For an evaluation of these systems at an early stage of the development traffic flow simulation programs and driving simulators are used. The requirement for their use is a realistic behavior - model of the surrounding vehicles. Therefore a model will be introduced, which takes the longitudinal vehicle guidance with its tactical elements into account. The basis of the modeling are extensive driving tests in order to examine the real driving behavior.

Transportat Res Board				Road traffic is a major source of air pollution, and substantial effort is currently being devoted to the development of both technological and transport policy measures to reduce the impacts. It is well established that the emission of certain pollutants is closely related to both traffic speed and fluctuations in traffic speed. However, conventional transport emission models are largely based on average traffic conditions, and thus they cannot properly represent the effects of policy measures, such as automatic speed control or traffic calming, that directly affect the speed dynamics of the traffic stream. Given the prevalence of such policies, there has been considerable effort to develop improved emissions modeling capabilities. A new approach to the microscopic modeling of air pollution from road traffic is described. This approach can represent detailed speed fluctuations in the flow of traffic, and it is applied to a local network in Maidstone, Kent, in the United Kingdom. A stochastic microscopic traffic flow simulation model (VISSIM), an existing speed-based emission database (MODEM), and a Gaussian dispersion model are combined. Simulated results are compared with a macroscopic model of air pollutant concentrations (DMRB method) and roadside pollutant measurements. Results are encouraging and show a good comparison with the DMRB method and, with some exceptions, good comparisons with trends in measured pollutant concentrations. Statistical differences in the methods, however, suggest that either measurement error or other inaccuracies are present.

However, the stochastic aspects of the multi-lane, continuous traffic flows significantly complicate the loading conditions in dynamics analysis of highway bridges. Such ambient traffic loadings often cause incremental changes of structural shear or bending stresses in bridge structures and therefore result in fatigue damage. Most current approaches for modeling traffic loading rely on simple load spectra approximations and address only the maximum effect of the loading. Therefore, they have limited ability to take into account the effect of such multi-lane ambient traffic flow loadings. This paper presents a stochastic modeling and simulation approach to describe ambient traffic flows over the highway bridges. A Poisson distributed pulse (PDP) process is used to model the stochastic nature of the continuous traffic flows with variable arrival rates and vehicle types. A Monte Carlo simulation algorithms are developed for generating ambient traffic loading input data sets for use in advanced finite element analysis and simulations applied to highway bridge structures. The simulation results, using this stochastic modeling approach in LS-DYNA nonlinear FEM analysis, show significantly improved ability to provide detailed understanding of structural conditions in damage detection and health monitoring of highway bridge structures.

Transportat Res Board				The extensive research under way to forecast traffic volumes from real-time data is expected to result in a significant increase in the use of real-time data for congestion mitigation and management in the next few years. Unfortunately, congestion-mitigation strategies based solely on these forecast volumes will disregard the impact of other traffic variables on crash occurrence. This may result in congestion-mitigation strategies that improve traffic flow but significantly increase crash rates. These other variables, for which real-time data are also available in traffic management centers, include speed and occupancy. However, real-time data have not been widely used in research to develop mathematical models that relate crash rates with these other traffic variables. The availability of this type of relationship will enable engineers in the field to develop congestion-mitigation strategies based not only on forecast volumes but also on real-time information on traffic variables such as speed and occupancy. A procedure that uses real-time data on traffic flow, speed, and occupancy and the relationship between these variables and crash occurrence could be used to develop congestion-mitigation strategies that incorporate safety. Currently, no such decision-support tool is readily available to the traffic engineer. The feasibility of developing such a methodology in which real-time data could be used to develop congestion-mitigation strategies that also consider crash risk was investigated. Models showing the relationship between flow and occupancy and between number of crashes and occupancy were developed for specific sites in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area. These models were then used to illustrate how diversion strategies that consider crash risk may be developed.

Transportat Res Board				Access management can improve safety or operations but may reduce accessibility for adjacent residences or businesses, causing conflict between the needs of local and through traffic and resulting in access management decisions being challenged by the public. Accordingly, transportation administrators require assurance regarding the accuracy of projected safety impacts of access management decisions. Several existing mathematical models quantify these impacts for selected access management techniques. Since new models require substantial resources to construct, it is prudent to investigate the extent to which existing models can be applied in other locations. A study of mathematical models that predict the number of crashes that will result as a function of signal spacing, median treatments, unsignalized driveways, and other key variables is reported. The study compared five models using a 10-year set of geometric, operational, and crash data for three case study corridors. The crash-p re diction ability of these models was assessed using traffic flow data other than the data set used to construct the models. Because some of the models were not developed for application elsewhere or were intended to be used only with a site-specific adjustment, the error percentages indicate the extent to which the models are transferable, but they do not constitute a critique of the previous research. With no site-specific adjustment, the accuracy of the models ranges from an average error of 34 to a few hundred percent. With simple site-specific adjustments, errors are in the range of 27 to 29 percent. Substantially less effort is required for these site-specific adjustments than would be required to create a new mathematical model. Recommendations were developed for using these models in practice, understanding their limitations, and interpreting their sensitivity to key inputs, data needs, and computational requirements.

The increasing population of mobile users leads to congestion problems in these systems, and motivates the development of more efficient management schemes. This work presents a new mobility management scheme that integrates the location area approach with the location prediction idea. It is based on results from traffic flow theory and it is first that uses the concept of moving location areas. Traffic flow theory suggests that people tend to reside in specific places for long periods of time. Occasionally, they move to new locations and try to minimize the travel time using highways as much as possible. The scheme uses two complement sets of location areas that overlap each other. The first set contains small location areas and is designated for locating mobile users in a quasi-static state. The second set covers the highways and it is designated to track mobile users while they are traveling from place to place, where each highway is covered by a single location area. The dual set design enables tracking mobile users at a high degree of accuracy with low update cost while they are quasi-static state, and reduces the amount of update operations when they travel. For tracing mobile users on a highway, the scheme aces a system of moving location auras. A moving location area (MLA) is a small location area that defines the location of a group of mobile users, which are geographically concentrated and move in the same direction. The scheme guarantees low rate of update and search operations at each cell of the system and efficiently utilizes the radio spectrum and the network resources with low computational overhead. This advantages are also backed by simulation results.

Traffic is controlled by regulating the vehicle access to the freeway and by limiting the vehicle speed by means of variable message signs. To describe the traffic behavior, a "classical" macroscopic model, first proposed by Payne, is adopted. Even though the problem is stated within a deterministic context, an optimal control law in feedback form is sought to react to unpredictable events. The resulting functional optimization problem is reduced to a nonlinear programming problem by constraining the control law to take on a tired structure in which free parameters have to be optimized. For such a structure, a multilayer feedforward neural mapping is chosen. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in two different case studies. For the simulation of the second case study, real traffic data are used, which allows one to very well represent critical traffic conditions on freeways.

The characterization of the air quality was carried out by measuring the typical traffic pollutants in relation to three different types of urban tunnels and to the traffic flows. The improvement project consisted of a ventilation system and a rearrangement of the traffic-light cycles. The effectiveness evaluation was carried out by the implementation of a multi-box model to calculate concentrations inside tunnels.

The system has now been set up and applied to air quality management, decision support and air quality forecasting in a number of major cities in Europe and beyond, including London. Key recent developments of the system include a regional chemistry model, links to real time and forecasted meteorological data and an advanced emission database (EMIT) for calculating current and projected road traffic emissions from different diurnal traffic flow profiles and vehicle mixes. In this study we consider a detailed analysis of the impact of various road traffic measures, such as high maintenance, low emission zones, increased bus use, reduced traffic flow etc, applied to the Birmingham metropolitan area. We show the impact on compliance or otherwise with the UK National Air Quality Strategy objectives and the proposed EU air quality daughter objectives. We also present high-resolution I maps of calculations for London of predictions based on projected vehicle emission changes for the years 2004 and 2005. Both these sets of results are being used by policy makers in local authorities in the preparation of their air quality management plans.

We have been studying the emotional algorithm evaluating and deciding the statement with artificial emotional model. This paper shows the efficiency of the different characteristics of the agent with emotional algorithm, so-called Individuality, and proposes the new traffic signal system, which optimizes the traffic flow by estimation of the driver's mind. The proposed traffic signal system applies the emotional algorithm to determine its motion. The emotional algorithm estimates the emotional value based on the emotional functions, which are defined on the emotional space. The emotional space consists of four factors, "HAPPY," "RELIEF," "AFRAID" and "ANGRY," and provides the emotional states of the system by the value on it. The emotional function imitates the state of driver's mind, and aims at the system not to inflict the psychological stress onto the driver. Moreover, the emotional function achieves the different characteristics of performances, individuality. The individuality of traffic signals can optimize the arrangements of signals. This report proposes the principal architecture of the emotional algorithm with above individual and the traffic signal system simulator using it. The numerical simulations clear the effectiveness of the new emotional algorithm with individuality and show the optimized arrangements of traffic signals. The DEA simulator, of which parameters dynamically change by evaluating the congestion of a road, improves the architecture of traffic signals networks.

In this approach, the traffic flow process is macroscopically modelled by use of a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The overall problem of coordinated ramp metering is formulated as a constrained discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem, and a feasible-direction nonlinear optimisation algorithm is employed for its numerical solution. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the 32-km Amsterdam ring-road for a number of different scenarios. Copyright (C) 2001 IFAC.

Microscopic traffic simulators can model traffic flow in a realistic manner and are ideal for agent-based vehicle control. In this paper we describe a model of a reactive agent that is used to control a simulated vehicle. The agent is capable of tactical-level driving and has different driving styles. To ensure fast reaction times, the agent's driving task is divided in several competing and reactive behaviour rules. The agent is implemented and tested in a prototype traffic simulator. The simulator consists of an urban environment with multi-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights, and vehicles. Every vehicle is controlled by a separate driving agent and all agents have individual behaviour settings. Preliminary experiments have shown that the agents exhibit human-like behaviour ranging from slow and careful to fast and aggressive driving behaviour.

For a class of initial configurations of particles (roughly speaking satisfying the Law of Large Numbers) the complete description of their limit behaviour (in time) is obtained, as well as estimates of the transient period. In this period the main object of interest is the dynamics of 'traffic jams', which is rigorously de fined and studied. It is shown that the dynamical system under consideration is chaotic in the sense that its topological entropy (calculated explicitly) is positive. Statistical quantities describing limit configurations are obtained as well.

Transportat Res Board				Since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, international commercial traffic has grown significantly, Texas has been the largest port of entry for trade at the U.S.-Mexico border since 1994, accounting for approximately 75 percent of the trade. Under NAFTA, FHWA predicts that trade through Texas could increase up to 120 percent in the coming years. Texas has 18 border sectors with Mexico, many of which have congestion primarily caused by ineffective interaction among inspection procedures and traffic management or lack of adequate transportation planning. A simulation model, developed using a general-purpose industrial engineering simulation package, can help determine the best alternative for preventing congestion at the ports of entry and the associated traffic operation effects on the road network adjoining the international bridges, while yet maintaining an adequate inspection of commercial trucks. A case study of the Ysleta-Zaragoza Bridge in El Paso, Texas, is presented. The simulation shows that the traffic flow at the Ysleta-Zaragoza Bridge is efficient with the current infrastructure and traffic operations. However, the expected future increase in traffic volume will generate a spill-back into major freeways close to the bridge. A proposed solution to this problem is presented.

Two 1 ybrid aj)13roaches are developed using a Self-Organising Map (SOM) to initially, classify traffic into different states. The first hybrid approach includes four Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models, whilst the second uses two Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) models. It was found that the SOM/ARIMA hybrid approach out-performs all individual ARIMA models, whilst the SOM/MLP hybrid approach achieves superior forecasting performance to all models used in this study, including three naive models. The effects of different proportions of missing data on Neural Network (NN) performance when forecasting traffic flow are assessed and several initial substitution options to replace missing data are discussed. Overall, it is shown that ARIMA models are more sensitive to the percentage of missing data than neural networks in this context.

ATM innovations can play a role in alleviating this capacity shortfall, especially at airports where new runways cannot be built because of space limitations or environmental constraints. Benefits are achieved by compressing the arrival stream to individual runways, ensuring efficient simultaneous use of multiple runways, ensuring proper traffic flow to the airport, and maintaining operations in the presence of unfavorable weather. This paper provides examples of initiatives in each of these areas.

Transportat Res Board				The Transportation Analysis and Simulation System (TRANSIMS) was developed as a replacement for the four-step travel demand model. The goal was to provide a simulation system that could analyze issues facing transportation planners such as sustainable development, environmental impacts of proposed projects, and intelligent transportation systems deployment. Because TRANSIMS represents a significant shift from the current state of the practice, the transportation planning community will need to spend significant human and capital resources preparing for the transition. Some insight into these transitional issues is provided on the basis of lessons learned from research on actual calibrated transportation networks in Texas. An overview of TRANSIMS in terms of its main components along with a brief comparison with the four-step model are supplied, followed by a discussion of the data requirements with specific reference to the current data needs associated with the four-step model. The challenges inherent in converting databases that have been developed for four-step models are also discussed on the basis of the conversion of existing traffic network files. Next, the TRANSIMS traffic flow theory is described, and the challenges for transportation planners are illustrated using calibrated networks from two highway corridors in Houston, Texas, and one diamond interchange network in College Station, Texas. Last, the capabilities of TRANSIMS with respect to output analysis are described.

Transportat Res Board				The use of breakeven analysis as a tool to assess the benefits of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) at the system level in systemwide sketch planning is discussed. The breakeven analysis was developed on the basis of the SCRITS (SCReening for ITS) spreadsheet template and used data from Madison, Wisconsin, as a case study and provided considerable insight into the magnitude of the potential benefits of different ITS programs. The analysis can help identify critical performance variables in the assessment of ITS benefits. Breakeven analysis coupled with sensitivity analysis can be used to identify and assess ITS projects for deployment in the ITS planning and programming process with limited data. It can be used to screen, prioritize, and select ITS projects among different ITS options. It can also be used to compare ITS projects in different geographic locations on the basis of different traffic data and breakeven points. The method is also useful in the identification of data needed for detailed ITS project assessments and evaluations. Such data should include before-and-after studies of ITS deployments as well as refined cost data and traffic flow estimates. The case study identified the breakeven points of several ITS deployment options, including ramp metering, traveler information systems, emergency response systems, and commercial vehicle operations under a variety of scenarios. These results can be used to identify and operate ITS projects so that they are likely to have the greatest payoff from their deployment.

This simulator permits analysis of traffic behavior in situations where both microscopic (vehicle-level) and mesoscopic (aggregate flow) effects are important, while avoiding the prohibitive computational cost of microsimulating a large-scale AHS. This paper describes the software structure of the meso-micro simulator, which implements the PATH AHS control architecture [4, 5]. Simulation results indicate that the meso-micro simulator generates consistent traffic flows across both meso and microsimulated regions.

It is difficult to predict travel time because there is much affection of uncertain factors. In this paper the average space speed is adopted as medium variable. The Artificial Neural Network technique is applied to map the relationship of the traffic volume and average space speed. Then average space speed was conversed to average travel time. This approach was tested using the data from an arterial road in ChangChun, China. The result shows that this method can make the predictive calculation reliable, easy and low cost.

The Gravity Model suggests that travel distance, monthly income and "jeepney" ownership all have varying effects on the population of the origin and destination areas. The Entropy Model, on the other hand, examined both origin-constrained ("from") and destination-constrained ("to") traffic flow in order to maximize entropy and minimize traffic congestion. Therefore, in order to achieve a state of minimum traffic congestion, the following should be attained: (1) population should be at its highest and travel distance, cost and time are at its minimum at the areas of origin; and (2) population and monthly income at its peak in the destination zones. The results will be beneficial in the study and use of land-use transportation models when forecasting future patterns of urban systems.

Field data was collected at three sites in uninterrupted and three sites in interrupted traffic facilities. Using two speed-distance measuring equipment connected to PC, the speed and position of both lead and lag vehicles for a distance of 500m on identical lane at each site were collected, The data covering speed, acceleration and gap distance of each vehicle was analyzed by speed groups to evaluate the best fitting model among 6 currently available car following models. It is found that two separate car following models having speeds more than and less than 90km/h traffic flow conditions should be applied. Relevant car following models by speed classification were suggested and simulation program was developed. The validity of suggested models were testified through the simulation program.

Such a large amount has caused the impact on traffic flow, energy, environment, labor and so on. Therefore, it is worth to do a research on how to transfer highway transport to railway or ship transport for mitigating the inland container transport flow. This study we use the gravity model to set up the inland container through transport competitive model to find the factors of the inland container transport flow in Taiwan area. From the viewpoint of modal shift model, we combines loading/unloading operation and transport method to establish the total cost function of the three transport methods, to set up an index, and chooses transport method based on the criteria of minimization cost.

Among the major atmospheric pollutants suspended particulate matter (SPM) levels have reached an alarming rate oftentimes exceeding thrice the local standards and WHO guidelines. With this perspective, there is a need to predict SPM emission levels by analizing the relationship of roadside SPM emissions and traffic flow characteristics such as traffic volume and speed of Specific vehicle types. In order to study tile contributions of SPM. The Study is focused on the roadside street-level concentration and particulate emissions in an open area is monitored. Regression analysis is used to obtain general characteristics of the roadside particulate pollution and to investigate the effects of traffic volume and wind velocity on SPM emission levels.

The urban traffic becoming worst time by time and the opening or widening urban highway even frequently resulted a rapid traffic growth and has led to unwanted urban traffic congestion. To bring about sustainable reduction in urban traffic volumes, significant changes will be necessary in the way of households and businesses engage in daily travel. Such changes are likely to involve changes in traffic generating and attracting land within urban areas. In this study the changes in the location of industries will be exercised, and it is expected to have the changes also in the location of residential and services and finally the positive impacts on traffic performances will be realised. In the first part of the study, some scenarios on industrial allocation will be adopted. A Lowry model will give interesting results from the view point of determination of the districts having potential for development. To prevent haphazard development of the city, new centres should be planned in advance. In the second part, the traffic flow results of the scenarios situation will be analysed. And finally it can be compared which land use, policies are suited to have a better traffic performance.

In this respect, managing traffic in congested networks requires a clear understanding of traffic flow operations; i.e. insights into what causes congestion, what determines the time and location of traffic breakdown, how does the congestion propagate through the network, etc., are essential. For this purpose, during the past fifty years, a wide range of traffic flow theories and models have been developed to answer these research questions. This paper presents a overview of some fifty years of modelling vehicular traffic flow. A rich variety of modelling approaches developed so far and in use today will be discussed and compared. The considered models are classified based on the level-of-detail with which the vehicular flow is described. For each of the categories, issues like modelling accuracy, applicability, generalizability, and model calibration and validation are discussed.

Streets are characterized by their size, direction, number of lanes, etc. Once the urban section is outlined, the constructions are translated into Cell-DEVS models, and the traffic flow is automatically set up. As modelers can focus in the problem to solve, development times for a simulation can be highly reduced. We show how to provide routing behavior. Based on routing information, the high level specifications are translated into cellular models that execute those specifications to describe path selections and vehicle routing in the city.

Transportat Res Board				The publication of the "fourth" full edition of the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) in the fall of 2000 represented a major step forward in state-of-the-art highway capacity and quality-of-service analyses. Even as this major step is taken, however, old issues reemerge and new ones arise as to the core concepts involved, the directions that such analyses should take in the future, and the needs of HCM users. Now that HCM has begun to address system and multimodal measures, the nature and meaning of capacity and level-of-service concepts need to be reexamined. The role of simulation must be more clearly defined, as must the limitations of more conventional highway capacity analyses. As databases improve, the question of statistical accuracy and stochastic variations in standard measures may seem more important, even though the inherent variability in traffic flow characteristics remains essentially unchanged. The need for software to implement ever more complex methodologies raises additional issues. As the Committee on Highway Capacity and Quality of Service and its members consider these and other important issues, an attempt to outline the major issues and alternatives that should be examined is made. In addition, some suggestions as to potential paths to follow are provided.

Transportat Res Board				The 2000 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) uses percent time-spent-following (PTSF) as the primary level-of-service (LOS) measure for two-lane highways. On Class I highways, average travel speed is used as an auxiliary measure. The new HCM provides methods for both two-way and directional estimation of PTSF, although the methods are not tot-ally compatible. On Finnish two-lane highways, PTSF is lower than that estimated by the HCM 2000 methodology. Also, the impact of directional distribution is greater, whereas the impact of no-passing zones is less. From the beginning of the motorized transportation era, traffic engineers have searched for methods to define the traffic capacity of highways. Capacity estimation is not enough, however, traffic engineers and road users are both interested in the quality of traffic flow. After almost a century, this search is not yet over. In fact, transportation telematics has increased the need for reliable descriptions of quality traffic flow by using performance measures and concepts that are easily understood by road users. Several performance and service measures (to assign a LOS) suggested for two-lane highways are discussed. The properties of PTSF are discussed in more detail because PTSF has been the most important service measure for two-lane highways since HCM 1985. The estimation of PTSF and its adjustment for prevailing conditions in HCM 2000 are compared by the use of data from Finland. Finally, the applicability of PTSF as a service measure is evaluated against a set of qualifications.

For the DTA calculation, feedback laws of the bang-bang, proportional, proportional plus integer (PI) types, and iterative algorithms that use Frank-Wolfe or PI updating formulas are investigated. Recently, METANET, a macroscopic simulation program for freeway networks, was extended to include generic feedback DTA calculation, whereas METANET-DTA, a new METANET derivative, which uses iterative DTA calculation, was developed. Respective program structures and DTA functions are described. Simulation results demonstrate the DTA functions of extended METANET and METANET-DTA.

Transportat Res Board				As a basic characteristic of traffic flow, vehicular travel speed is indispensable in many research and management tasks. In travel speed estimation, vehicular free-flow speed is a crucial determining factor, particularly when the traffic is light or moderate. The current state-of-the-art modeling of free-flow speeds is explored. The development of models of free-flow speed for Indiana arterial roads that may also be suitable for other states in the Midwest is described. Separate free-flow-speed models are presented for cars and trucks during daytime and nighttime hours. Aggregate models could easily be available if the methods provided are followed. The presentation includes the research background, the data-collection and data-processing procedures, a description of model development, and an analysis and a description of a means of refinement of the model.

Transportat Res Board				Short-term freeway traffic flow forecasting efforts to date have focused on predictions based solely on previous observations at the location of interest. This univariate prediction is useful for certain types of intelligent transportation system (ITS) forecasts, such as operational demand forecasts at system entry points. In addition, data from upstream sensors should improve forecasts at downstream locations. This motivates investigation of multivariate forecast models that include upstream sensor data. A candidate model is transfer functions with autoregressive integrated moving average errors, other-wise known as the ARIMAX model. The ARIMAX model was applied to motorway data from France that had been the subject of previous traffic flow forecasting research. The results indicate that ARIMAX models provide improved forecast performance over univariate forecast models. However, several issues must be addressed before widespread use of ARIMAX models for ITS forecasts is feasible. These issues include the increased complexity of model specification, estimation, and maintenance; model consistency; model robustness in the face of interruptions in the upstream data series; and variability in the cross-correlation between upstream and downstream observations. The last issue is critical because ARIMAX models assume constant transfer function parameters, whereas the correlation between upstream and downstream observations vary with prevailing traffic conditions, especially traffic stream speed. Therefore, further research is needed to investigate model extensions and refinements to provide a generalizable, self-tuning multivariate forecasting model that is easily implemented and that effectively models varying upstream to downstream correlations.

Transportat Res Board				Variations in traffic flow patterns can be very useful in helping intelligent transportation systems (ITS) provide drivers with useful and accurate route and travel-time information, in examining the potential benefits of flexible work hours, and in assessing the environmental effects of traffic congestion. Much of the work done toward examining temporal and spatial variations in traffic flow has concentrated on freeways, largely ignoring urban areas, where ITS strategies can have the most important effects. Addressed are the issues of temporal and spatial distributions and variations in real-time traffic flow by using data from 140 loop detectors from the greater Athens, Greece, urban area. The results indicate that the temporal distributions of traffic flows are nonnormal, and they vary by direction (toward, in, or away from the central business district) and time of day. This result has important implications in correctly calibrating the real-time simulation models used for volume and travel-time predictions. The results also indicate that traffic in Athens exhibits low seasonality, with lower traffic during the summer months, although traffic conditions are very similar for all weekdays but vary relative to the weekends and by time of day.

Transportat Res Board			LANE	Most dynamic flow models are developed under deterministic assumptions or simple linear models. Although these models can describe dynamic phenomena, they cannot adapt a variance of the real world. However, in the developing trend of intelligent transportation systems, operators have to understand and accurately predict traffic flow to predict, evaluate, and manage the performance of present and future systems. Thus, a model capable of describing variant traffic phenomena, which encompasses both nonlinearity and stochasticity, is necessary. This study formulates nonlinear stochastic dynamic traffic flow models based on conventional macroscopic models; the nonlinear terms are decomposed by polynomials to reduce the complexity of the models. Then, the 116 equation is introduced to convert the deterministic model to a stochastic one. Also considered here is the traffic flow model with a diffusion effect.

Both plans are estimated under a dynamic traffic control system designated as Dynamic Intersection Signal Control Optimization (DISCO). DISCO considers the entire Fundamental Diagram of traffic flow, which is essential for controlling congested and transient traffic. As a dynamic model, DISCO works with time-variant traffic patterns and derives dynamic adaptive timing plans. In this study, we applied DISCO to both uncongesed and congested network Argyle Street area in Mongkok. The results showed that DISCO performed better under the more flexible control scheme of "variable green - no cycle" strategy which may also imply that DISCO shows promise as a new approach for demand-responsive traffic control.

An algorithm is specified which, for a fairly general objective function, continually moves current traffic flows, green-times and prices within the model toward locally optimal values while taking account of users' responses. The directions of movement of current traffic flows, green-times and prices are determined by solving linear approximations to the actual problem. The results of applying a simplified form of the algorithm to a small network model with five routes and two signal-controlled junctions are given. It is proved that under realistic conditions the sequence of (traffic flows, green-times, prices) triples generated by the algorithm does indeed approach those triples which possess a reasonable local optimality property. However the optimal control problem discussed here is non-convex and just a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point is the "answer" sought. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The average winter weather vehicle speed was significantly lower than normal, and multiple regression indicated a relationship among the average off-peak winter weather vehicle speed, the square of hourly volume, visibility, and roadway snow cover. The traffic volume variable in this model was believed to be a surrogate for weather data not collected. The model predicts that visibility below 0.4 km (0.25 mi) and snow cover on the roadway lanes may reduce average off-peak winter weather vehicle speeds by approximately 6.3 and 11.7 km/h (3.9 and 7.3 mph), respectively. It was concluded that the collection of traffic flow and roadway surface data during winter weather events requires the seamless integration, planning, and calibration of a partially video-based automated permanent or semipermanent information system. The ability to assess, quantify, and communicate the potential vehicle speed effects of winter weather could assist drivers with travel decisions and public-sector workers with maintenance decisions.

The method has been successfully applied in the city of Seville (Spain) to forecast ozone emission concentration typically one day in advance. The applied methodology is based on the following steps: 1. The development of an exhaustive measurement campaign in order to evaluate ozone pollution in the city during 1999 summer, autumn and winter (partially) providing a consistent data series of ozone and meteorological variables. 2. A screening of the most relevant variables affecting ozone concentration to obtain accurate forecasting capabilities based on a reduced number of easy-to-measure parameters: traffic, meteorology and features of the area (street width, building height, etc.). 3. A neural network approach based on a backpropagation algorithm is adopted to provide both spatial and temporal predictions. In the first case, estimated ozone concentration can be obtained in any area of the city without direct measurements. In the second case, it is possible to predict future ozone concentration levels in the same locations based on weather and traffic flows forecasting.

Such an approach provides insight into total vehicle fleet emissions on that link. However, estimation of emission factors from the measured concentration raises a set of complex issues. The concentrations depend not only on the emission factors, but also to a large degree on meteorological factors, as well as on the topography of the area. Using the number/mass balance model, a theoretical relationship was developed earlier that allows for calculation of emission factors from the concentrations measured at a specific point above the road, taking into account wind as the only removal mechanism of the emitted pollutants. Using this model, average emission factors for all vehicles on the road can be estimated and then used to arrive at emission factors for individual types of vehicles, given a known vehicle fleet composition. The work presented here is an extension of the model to include the effect of humidity and temperature, as well as topographical aspects, on the concentrations measured. Starting from the principles of combustion processes, as well as of the dynamics of pollutant interaction and transport, some of the general mechanisms affecting emissions or concentrations were included in the model. The empirical dependencies were derived from the results of extensive monitoring of traffic flow and associated emissions at two city sites. The latter included a freeway link and a major signal controlled urban arterial link. The model and experimental results can be applied to estimate average emission factors from measurements conducted at any road link.

The goal of an engineer to either increase roadway capacity or improve traffic flow may often conflict with a neighbourhood's goal to be free of congestion, pollution, and traffic noise. Controversies involving traffic noise are often based on misinformation, or perception, not on facts, good engineering, or reality. Resident's perceptions of road-based noise on urban road segments in the central area of Xanthi, Northern Greece, have been examined. An effort has been made to link disturbance from road-based noise and house type, proximity to noise source, resident activity patterns, speed limit variations, traffic composition and type of road surfaces. Traffic counts covered weekend and working days. Different types of vehicles were grouped in a way that would give the influence of heavy vehicles to the generated noise levels. A social inquiry was also conducted. Questionnaires were completed covering subjects such as the type of the house, the number of persons living in the house, the ages and profession, the annoyance of the inhabitants from various noise sources, etc. The traffic and noise measurements were related to the replies of the citizens. A variety of possible noise mitigation measures can reduce the noise impacts of the existing roadway network.

J	Mensink, C				Mensink, C			Validation of urban emission inventories	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT			English	Article						emission validation; emission inventories; road transport; urban traffic; emission factors; emission measurements		Two emission validation methods are presented. The first method focuses on the precision of the emission factors and the accuracy of modelled traffic flows. Emission factors derived from the COPERT II methodology are compared with on-board emission measurements and modelled traffic flow rates are compared with observations. The second validation method focuses on the completeness of the inventory, i.e. coverage of all sources. The method compares measured pollutant fluxes in the urban plume with the downwind transported and dispersed emissions integrated over plume width and mixing height. Both methods seem to indicate that traffic emission factors used in the urban emission inventories show large uncertainties. Besides the lack of measurement precision this is mainly induced by external influence factors like driving behaviour and vehicle maintenance.

J	El-Fadel, M; Sbayti, H				El-Fadel, M; Sbayti, H			Noise control at congested urban intersections: Sensitivity analysis of traffic management alternatives	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								Urban areas of Beirut suffer severe traffic congestion because of a deficient transportation system resulting in economic losses and adverse environmental impacts. Grade-separations are proposed at several intersections to alleviate or minimize this problem. Noise levels, which are highly dependent on the geometric configuration of an intersection, are a major environmental concern, This paper presents an impact assessment of traffic noise at urban intersections including an analysis of traffic management strategies. Noise measurements were taken at several intersections to describe existing noise exposure levels and to calibrate a noise attenuation model. Simulations were performed for several traffic management scenarios including with and without grade separations, changes in vehicle mix, type of pavement, and level-of-service. Two typical intersections with 65 and 95 percent traffic through a grade separation are analyzed. An assessment of impact significance associated with traffic noise emissions was then conducted by comparing predicted noise exposure levels with baseline noise levels and relevant noise exposure standards, with the objective of optimizing intersection management in terms of minimal noise impacts. Simulation results showed that besides traffic flow improvement, a grade separation reduces noise impacts because of its ability to deviate sound waves from sensitive receptors, However, the traffic management alternatives considered in this study do not appear to produce a difference that would be discernable to neighborhood residents and, hence, would not be effective, by themselves, in controlling urban noise.

J	Fouladvand, ME				Fouladvand, ME			Reaction-diffusion models describing a two-lane traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								A unidirectional two-lane road is approximated by a set of two parallel closed one-dimensional chains. Two types of cars, i.e., slow and fast ones are considered in the system. Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg model of traffic flow [K. Nagel and M. Schreckenberg, J. Phys. 2, 2221 (1992)], a set of reaction-diffusion processes is introduced to simulate the behavior of the cars. Fast cars can pass the slow ones using the passing lane. We write and solve the mean-held rate equations for the density of slow and fast cars, respectively. We also investigate the properties of the model through computer simulations and obtain the fundamental diagrams. A comparison between our results and the v(max) = 2 version of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model is made.

J	Lubashevsky, IA; Mahnke, R				Lubashevsky, IA; Mahnke, R			Order-parameter model for unstable multilane traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITION; KINEMATIC WAVES; SIMULATION; HIERARCHY; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAY; JAMS	We discuss a phenomenological approach to the description of unstable vehicle motion on multilane highways that explains in a simple way the observed sequence of the "free flow <-> synchronized mode <-> jam" phase transitions as well as the hysteresis in these transitions. We introduce a variable called an order parameter that accounts for possible correlations in the vehicle motion at different lanes. So, it is principally due to the "many-body" effects in the car interaction in contrast to such variables as the mean car density and velocity being actually the zeroth and first moments of the "one-particle" distribution function. Therefore, we regard the order parameter as an additional independent state variable of traffic flow. We assume that these correlations are due to a small group of ''fast'' drivers and by taking into account the general properties of the driver behavior we formulate a governing equation for the order parameter. In this context we analyze the instability of homogeneous traffic flow that manifested itself in the above-mentioned phase transitions and gave rise to the hysteresis in both of them. Besides, the jam is characterized by the vehicle flows at different lanes which are independent of one another. We specify a certain simplified model in order to study the general features of the car cluster self-formation under the "free flow <-> synchronized motion" phase transition.

J	Li, T				Li, T			Global solutions and zero relaxation limit for a traffic flow model	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						relaxation; shock wave; rarefaction wave; Glimm scheme; traffic flows; anisotropic; equilibrium; anticipation; marginally stable; zero relaxation limit	HYPERBOLIC CONSERVATION-LAWS; APPROXIMATIONS	We construct global solutions and study their relaxation limit for a system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation arising in traffic flows. The system of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation was derived as a nonequilibrium continuum model of traffic flows. The purpose of the new model is to address the anisotropic feature of traffic flows. The resulting hyperbolic system with relaxation is marginally stable. Thus there is no diffusion in the process of relaxation. Our analysis is vastly different from existing theory for hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation which relies on the dissipative nature of the relaxation process. Our analysis is based on a generalized Glimm scheme. For initial data with bounded total variation, we prove that the total variation of the solutions is bounded for all time and the bound is independent of the relaxation parameter. Thus we obtain the zero relaxation limit. Finally, we make a comparison between our results and data measured on the I-880 freeway in California ( see [Skabardonis et al., Transportation Research Record, 1554 (1996), pp. 204-212]). The comparison shows qualitative agreement between the analytic results and the data.

The four types of walkers interact with each other at the crossing where there are random walkers going to the right, left, up, and down. It is found that a dynamical jamming transition from the moving state at low density to the stopped state at high density occurs at the critical density. The transition point depends on the strength of drift and decreases with increasing drift. The transition point does not depend on the length of roads connecting the crossing for the long road. Also, the pedestrian traffic with two types of walkers is studied where there are random walkers going to the right and up. It is compared with the pedestrian traffic with the four types of random walkers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on two criteria, local velocity variation patterns and expansion (or nonexpansion) of congested regions, three distinct congested traffic slates are identified. These states appear at different levels of the upstream flux and the on-ramp flux, thereby generating a phase digram of the congested traffic flow. Observed traffic states are compared with recent theoretical analyses and both agreeing and disagreeing features are found.

Traffic flow is modeled by a system of Newton-type ordinary differential equations. Different solutions (equilibria and limit cycles) of this system correspond to different phases of traffic. Limit cycles appear as results of Hopf bifurcations (with density as a parameter) and are found analytically in small neighborhoods of bifurcation points. A study of the development of limit cycles with an aid of numerical methods is performed.

Since urban transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, measures are required to reduce these emissions. Given that during peak periods, road vehicles propelled by petroleum fuel-based internal combustion engines produce a high level of GHG emissions due to stop and go operations, measures to improve traffic flow can play an effective mitigation role. This paper describes a simulation-based methodology and a case study for the quantification of GHG emission reduction owing to advanced traffic control systems.

For management of merging, collision avoidance between vehicles, ride comfort, and the effect on traffic flow should be considered. This paper proposes an unmanned vehicle-merging algorithm that consists of two procedures. First, a longitudinal control algorithm is designed to keep a safe headway between vehicles in a single lane. Secondly,'vacant slot and ghost vehicle' concept is introduced and a decision algorithm is designed to determine the sequence of vehicles entering a converging section considering total traffic flow. The sequencing algorithm is based on fuzzy rules and the membership functions are determined first by an intuitive method and then trained by a learning method using a neural net. The vehicle-merging algorithm is shown to be effective through simulations based on a PRT model.

J	Hurdle, VF; Son, B				Hurdle, VF; Son, B			Road test of a freeway model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article							KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC DYNAMICS	A few years ago Newell reworked classical traffic wave theory into "A Simplified theory of kinematic waves in highway traffic" (Newell, 1993a,b). The simplifications - use of cumulative count curves instead of flows for most of the calculations and a triangular flow-density relation to describe traffic flows - were sufficient to allow him to apply the theory (Newell, 1993c) to complex situations with multiple bottlenecks and multi-destination flows. This paper tests Newell's model by comparing its predictions with conditions observed at three freeway test sites. The test data from San Francisco Bay Area freeways is old, but extraordinarily detailed, so provides the necessary input and observed densities for comparison. In the tests, the model did a very good job of predicting the growth and decay pattern of large queues and the effect of traffic entering and leaving the roadway within a congested area, but had difficulties dealing with light or sporadic congestion. However, the predicted travel times were quite accurate even for lightly congested roadways. The estimation of roadway capacities needed as input proved to be a major problem. The duration of queuing - both in the model and the real world - is very sensitive to the maximum rate at which vehicles can enter bottlenecks, and neither standard estimation tools nor the data set provided estimates of sufficient precision. This would seem to be a problem for any freeway model, but for many purposes there is no need for the level of accuracy sought here, and for others better data would be available. Overall, the results were very encouraging: the model requires very little calculation time and delivers excellent results for the severely congested freeways that are of the most practical interest.

J	Chang, TH; Lin, JT				Chang, TH; Lin, JT			Optimal signal timing for an oversaturated intersection	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								Traffic congestion occurs frequently at downtown intersections during rush hours, at road construction zones as well as at accident sites. Under such circumstances, traffic flow exceeds intersection capacity causing queuing of automobiles that cannot be eliminated in one signal cycle. In this paper, we present a timing decision methodology which considers the whole oversaturation period. Discrete dynamic optimization models are developed and an algorithm to solve them is presented. The optimal cycle length and the optimal assigned green time for each approach are determined for the case of two-phase control. The application of the performance index model to certain multi-phase signals in common use is also introduced. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed discrete type performance index model is a more appropriate design for congested traffic signal timing control. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Park, BB; Rouphail, NM; Hummer, JE				Park, BB; Rouphail, NM; Hummer, JE			Probabilistic approach to implementing traffic signal warrants	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								Traffic signal warrants documented in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Der ices neglects the effect of daily and hourly volume variations in traffic. Furthermore, current practice cannot be used to prioritize signal installations among multiple intersections that meet the warrants. Finally, there is no guidance in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices on how the warrants can be applied to projected traffic conditions when hourly counts are not available. This paper describes a probabilistic approach to implementing traffic signal warrants. The proposed approach used Monte Carlo simulation to generate, on the basis of variable hourly traffic counts, the probability that any particular signal warrant will be met at an intersection. The simulation approach was extended to develop planning level guidelines for signal installation using predefined synthetic traffic flow profiles and the average daily traffic estimates for the intersecting streets. The proposed guidelines were compared with current planning guidelines used in Texas and California. The comparison results indicate that the Texas guidelines tend to underestimate the need for traffic signal installation, whereas the California guidelines tend to overestimate the need.

The AHS is a large, complex system, in which vehicles are automatically controlled. The design and implementation of the AHS required advances in actuator and sensor technologies, as well as the design, analysis, simulation, and testing of large-scale, hierarchical, hybrid control systems. This paper focuses on the multilayer AHS control architecture and some questions of implementation.

Rev. Lett. 79 (1997) 4030. Kerner and Rehborn, Phys. Rev. E 53 (1996) R4275; Kerner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3797, Kerner and Rehborn, Phy's. Rev. E 53 (1996) R1297). Influence of on-ramp flux is Important In generating the stop-and-go traffic flow near the ramps (Lee ct at.. Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 1130; Lee et al., Phys. Rev. E 59 (1999) 5101). In this work, we study the phase diagram of the continuum traffic flow model equation in the presence of an on-lamp. Using an open boundary condition, traffic stales and metastabilities are investigated for several representative values of the upstream boundary flux and for a range of the on-ramp Bur. We rind several traffic states such as the pinned localized cluster (PLC) slate, the oscillating pinned localized cluster (OPLC) or the recurring hump (RH) state, the oscillating congested traffic (OCT) stare and the homogeneous congested traffic (HCT) state. The latter two are traffic jam states. The free flow, the OPLC stare and the jam can coexist in a certain metastable region : here the free Row can undergo phase transitions to tither of the two states under fluctuations. Some of these stares are related to observed traffic states. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

From traffic-economic and traffic-pollution viewpoints, the suppression of traffic jam is an important issue we have to solve. The present paper shows that H-infinity-norm, which has been used in the field of control theory, can reveal the traffic jam phenomenon in an optimal velocity traffic model under an open boundary condition. Furthermore, we suppress the traffic jam in the model by the decentralized delayed-feedback control method. Some numerical simulations are shown to verify our theoretical results.

This implies that the explicit delay time is not important in contrast to the traditional car following models, in which the explicit delay time was thought to be essential to explain realistic traffic flow. Effective delay times in various cases are estimated: the case of a leader vehicle and its follower, a queue of vehicles controlled by traffic lights and the many-vehicle case of highway traffic flow. The remarkable result is that in most of the situation for which we can make a reasonable definition of an effective delay time, the obtained delay time is of order one second. This agrees with the observed data very well.

J	Ceder, A				Ceder, A			An applicatoin of an optimal traffic control during lane closure periods of a two-lane road	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								On two-lane roadways, when provision should be made for alternative one-way movement (for construction or maintenance), the traffic characteristics differ from normal operation in which no lane is closed. The purpose of this study is to derive optimal strategies for controlling, by means of traffic signals, the one lane operation tin two-way roadways). In this study, strategies to determine the optimal length of the closed one-lane section during construction and maintenance work are established. This length minimizes the objective function representing the tradeoff between delay cost and operational cost. Using the length value obtained by the proposed model, plus a timing methodology, the overall cost of operating the closed highway section can be minimized. The sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution for the section length is examined with respect to the input variables. This analysis shows that for very low traffic flow values (less than 100 vph per direction), the solution is very sensitive to fuel price changes, while for greater flow values, the solution is insensitive to this change. Similar results are obtained for changes in the worker's wage which is part of both the operational and the delay cost. That is, the section's length is sensitive to wage changes at low traffic flow and insensitive otherwise. Based on the results presented in this study, it is possible to establish a guideline for the section's length determination. The control measure can emerge from a pair of traffic signals that can be installed at both ends of the closed highway segment. This traffic control system is also described in the study in terms of its components and operational features and advantages.

J	Klar, A; Wegener, R				Klar, A; Wegener, R			Kinetic derivation of macroscopic anticipation models for vehicular traffic	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						traffic flow; macroscopic equations; kinetic derivation		This paper has been motivated by the work of Aw and Rascle [SIAM J. Appl. Math., 60 (2000), pp. 916-938]. As noted by Daganzo [Transportation Res. B, 29 (1995), pp. 277-286] some macroscopic models for vehicular traffic encounter difficulties showing nonphysical effects in certain situations. In the paper by Aw and Rascle a new heuristic model has been presented that avoids these difficulties. We present here a kinetic derivation of a class of macroscopic traffic flow equations including the Aw-Rascle equations. The coefficients appearing in the equations are identified from the solutions of the underlying kinetic equations. Moreover, numerical experiments and comparisons between the different models are presented.

This paper assesses the use of a GIS-based, regression mapping technique to model spatial patterns of traffic-related air pollution. The model - developed using data from 80 passive sampler sites in Huddersfield, as part of the SAVIAH (Small Area Variations in Air Quality and Health) project - uses data on traffic flows and land cover in the 300-m buffer zone around each site, and altitude of the site, as predictors of NO, concentrations. It was tested here by application in four urban areas in the UK: Huddersfield (for the year following that used for initial model development), Sheffield, Northampton, and part of London. In each case, a GIS was built in ArcInfo, integrating relevant data on road traffic, urban land use and topography. Monitoring of NO2 was undertaken using replicate passive samplers (in London, data were obtained from surveys carried out as part of the London network). In Huddersfield, Sheffield and Northampton, the model was first calibrated by comparing modelled results with monitored NO2 concentrations at 10 randomly selected sites; the calibrated model was then validated against data from a further 10-28 sites. In London, where data for only 11 sites were available, validation was not undertaken. Results showed that the model performed well in all cases. After local calibration, the model gave estimates of mean annual NO2 concentrations within a factor of 1.5 of the actual mean (approx. 70-90%) of the time and within a factor of 2 between 70 and 100% of the time. r(2) values between modelled and observed concentrations are in the range of 0.58-0.76. These results are comparable to those achieved by more sophisticated dispersion models. The model also has several advantages over dispersion modelling. It is able, for example, to provide high-resolution maps across a whole urban area without the need to interpolate between receptor points. It also offers substantially reduced costs and processing times compared to formal dispersion modelling. It is concluded that the model might thus be used as a means of mapping long-term air pollution concentrations either in support of local authority air-quality management strategies, or in epidemiological studies.

J	Kwon, E; Choi, B; Park, H				Kwon, E; Choi, B; Park, H			Distributed simulation of freeway traffic flow using personal computers	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article								This article presents a personal computer (PC)-based distributed simulation methodology that can be applicable for real-time estimation of time-variant parameters in freeway traffic flow The method uses the interprocess communication procedures currently available under Windows NT and adopts two types of distributed computing architectures, i.e., a distributed-memory structure with a network of PCs communicating through Named Pipe and a multithread-based shared-memory structure with a multiprocessor PC. The proposed method, based on the macroscopic traffic model developed and tested in previous studies, first divides a given freeway into a set of subsections depending on the number of available processors or personal computers. At every time step, each processor simulates its own subsection and exchanges the internal boundary data with another processor that simulates the adjacent subsection. The performance of the parallel algorithm was compared with that of a single-processor-based sequential simulation using two different types of hardware configurations: a network of two PCs and a dual-processor PC. The test results with the two-PC network parallel system showed the speedup of 1.94 over the sequential simulation with a single PC, i.e., 48.4 percent reduction in the execution time, for the 1-hour simulation of a 20-mile freeway section. The speed up for 1-hour simulation of an 80-mile section was increased to 1.96 with two processors, which is close to the ideal speedup. The performance rests with the dual-processor PC resulted in consistently, but not significantly, faster execution than those with the two-PC network, which indicates the feasibility of developing a practical on-line decision support system with a network of personal computers for freeway operations.

J	Jang, HM; Chen, FL				Jang, HM; Chen, FL			A novel approach to the transient ventilation of road tunnels	JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS			English	Article						ventilation; tunnel		We propose in this paper a novel approach to predict the transient behavior of the ventilation of road tunnel based on the traffic data measured at the outlet portal of tunnel. The approach starts with a so-called traffic group-partition dilemma, which essentially partitions the traffic flow into various groups so that the transient behavior of the induced wind speed can be accurately predicted. As a result, one may employ the present approach to predict the ventilation situation along a road tunnel, which can be a long tunnel in motorway, and needs only to measure the traffic data at one location in or near the tunnel, for example, the outlet portal. Accordingly, the present approach shall become a rather economic and efficient scheme to be considered to monitor the ventilation situation in road tunnels as the approach is converted into a computer program, which can be used in the real-time Ventilation control of the tunnel (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For a given current origin-destination (O-D) demand pattern, we can have a corresponding link flow pattern on the network through an appropriate equilibrium traffic assignment model. Supposing that flow on each link associated with the current O-D demand is below a given upper bound such as link capacity or any other prescribed threshold, we would ask how much additional demand from each trip origin can be accommodated by the network so that flow on each link is still within the given bound when the additional and existing demand is together assigned to the network. This problem can be referred to as the network capacity and level of service problem and is fully investigated in this paper. New formulations are presented and compared with existing techniques in terms of the assumption of O-D demand pattern and travelers' route and location choice behavior for the capacity and level of service modeling. Numerical examples are provided and potential applications of the models are mentioned. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kaupuzs, J; Mahnke, R				Kaupuzs, J; Mahnke, R			A stochastic multi-cluster model of freeway traffic	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; TRANSITION	A stochastic approach based on the Master equation is proposed to describe the process of formation and growth of car clusters in traffic flow in analogy to usual aggregation phenomena such as the formation of liquid droplets in supersaturated vapour. By this method a coexistence of many clusters on a one-lane circular road has been investigated. Analytical equations have been derived for calculation of the stationary cluster distribution and related physical quantities of an infinitely large system of interacting cars. If the probability per time (or p) to decelerate a car without an obvious reason tends to zero in an infinitely large system, our multi-cluster model behaves essentially in the same way as a one-cluster model studied before. In particular, there are three different regimes of traffic flow (free jet of cars, coexisting phase of jams and isolated cars, highly viscous heavy traffic) and two phase transitions between them. At finite values of p the behaviour is qualitatively different, i.e., there is no sharp phase transition between the free jet of cars and the coexisting phase. Nevertheless, a jump-like phase transition between the coexisting phase and the highly viscous heavy traffic takes place both at p --> 0 and at a finite p. Monte-Carlo simulations have been performed for finite roads showing a time evolution of the system into the stationary state. In distinction to the one-cluster model, a remarkable increasing of the average flux has been detected at certain densities of cars due to finite-size effects.

As noted in [C. Daganzo, Requiem for second-order fluid with approximation to traffic flow, Transportation Res. Part B, 29 (1995), pp. 277-286], the previous "second order" models, i.e., models with two equations (mass and "momentum"), lead to nonphysical effects, probably because they try to mimic the gas dynamics equations, with an unrealistic dependence on the acceleration with respect to the space derivative of the "pressure." We simply replace this space derivative with a convective derivative, and we show that this very simple repair completely resolves the inconsistencies of these models.

One of the aims of the simulation model is to predict traffic flows on a transportation network for various times of the day by using available statistical data sources as input. We first discuss the general conceptual underpinnings of the model, and against a brief discussion of existing activity-based models of transport demand we outline the major differences between these models and the current one. Next, major operational decisions, data input, and model architecture are discussed, followed by an illustration of the model for the Eindhoven region in the Netherlands. We conclude the paper by critically discussing its basic assumptions and identifying avenues of future research.

Methods-Data on wheeze and asthma were collected in a cross sectional questionnaire survey of 22 968 primary school children (age 4-11) and 27 826 secondary school children (age 11-16) in the Nottingham area. Direct measures of road traffic flow were made in the locality of each school and combined with Local Authority traffic data for major roads to estimate local traffic activity in vehicle metres/day/km(2). Assessment of the effects of potential confounders was performed in nested case-control groups of 6576 primary and 5936 secondary children. Data on frequency of wheeze were collected for the cases to study disease severity. Longitudinal data on a historical cohort of 883 children who reported wheeze when aged 4-11 in 1988 were used to study the persistence of wheeze into adolescence. Results-Unadjusted prevalence of wheeze in the past year within schools varied widely but was not associated with traffic activity in the school locality (weighted regression coefficient beta=-0.01, p=0.93 for primary schools, beta=-0.18, p=0.26 for secondary schools). The risk of wheeze in individual primary school children was not associated with traffic activity analysed as a continuous variable, although there was some suggestion of a weak, non-linear plateau effect. Similar effects were found for diagnosed asthma and recent cough. There was no evidence of any relation between traffic activity and risk of wheeze in secondary school children. There were positive but non-significant dose related effects of traffic activity on wheeze severity in primary and secondary children and on persistence of wheeze in the longitudinal cohort. Conclusions-Traffic activity in the school locality is not a major determinant of wheeze in children.

We develop some analytic queueing models based on traffic counts and we model the behavior of traffic flows as a function of some of the most relevant determinants. These analytic models allow for parameterized experiments, which pave the way towards our research objectives: assessing what-if scenario's and sensitivity analysis for traffic management, congestion control, traffic design and the environmental impact of road traffic (e.g. emission models).

J	Dickerson, A; Peirson, J; Vickerman, R				Dickerson, A; Peirson, J; Vickerman, R			Road accidents and traffic flows: An econometric investigation	ECONOMICA			English	Article							SAFETY; REGRESSION	This paper develops an empirical model of the relationship between road traffic accidents and traffic flows. The analysis focuses on the accident externality, which is determined mainly by the difference between the marginal and average risks. The model is estimated using a new data-set which combines hourly London traffic count data from automated vehicle recorders together with police records of road accidents. The accident-flow relationship is seen to vary considerably between different road classes and geographical areas. More importantly, even having controlled for these and other differences, the accident externality is shown to vary significantly with traffic flows. In particular, while the accident externality is typically close to zero for low to moderate traffic flows, it increases substantially at high traffic flows.

J	Sakakibara, T; Honda, Y; Horiguchi, T				Sakakibara, T; Honda, Y; Horiguchi, T			Effect of obstacles on formation of traffic jam in a two-dimensional traffic network	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; network; numerical simulations; city roads; traffic jam	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW MODELS; JAMMING TRANSITION; SELF-ORGANIZATION; CONGESTION; CARS	We investigate the effect of obstacles on formation of a traffic jam for a traffic flow in a network of city roads. We consider a square lattice of two bonds between two nearest crossings as a network of city roads; we assume that there are three lattice sites in a crossing. We put five decorated sites on each bond between two nearest crossings. A car or an obstacle is assumed to be located on one of these decorated sites or one of the lattice sites. We assume only two types of cars. namely one type of cars move mainly in the positive I direction and change their direction to the positive y direction with a probability and the other type of cars move mainly in the positive y direction and change their direction to the positive y direction with the same probability. One of two lanes is assumed to be used mainly for passing the obstacles or jamming other cars. We set rules for car moving in order to make our traffic-flow model by taking into account all the possible situations. By using numerical simulations, we find that a traffic jam is formed more easily for obstacles placed very close to traffic signals in the traffic direction than for those in the other cases.

J	Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL				Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL			Continuum modeling of multiclass traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								In contemporary macroscopic traffic flow modeling, a distinction between user-classes is rarely made. However, it is envisaged that both the accuracy and the explanatory ability of macroscopic traffic flow models can be improved significantly by distinguishing classes and their specific driving characteristics. In this article, we derive such a multiple user-class traffic flow model. Starting point for the derivation of the macroscopic flow model is the user-class specific phase-space density, which can be considered as a generalization of the traditional density. The gas-kinetic equations describing the dynamics of the multiclass Phase-Space Density (MUC-PSD) are governed by various, interacting processes, such as acceleration towards a class-specific desired velocity, deceleration caused by vehicle interactions and the influence of lane changing. The gas-kinetic equations serve as the foundation of the proposed macroscopic traffic flow models, describing the dynamics of the class-dependent spatial density, velocity and velocity variance. The modeling approach yields explicit relations for both the velocity and the velocity variance. These equilibrium relations show competing processes: on the one hand, drivers accelerate towards their class-dependent desired velocity, while on the other hand, they need to decelerate due to interactions with vehicles from their own class and asymmetric interactions with vehicles from other classes. Using the operationalized model, macroscopic simulations provide insight into the model behavior for different scenarios. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ziliaskopoulos, AK				Ziliaskopoulos, AK			A linear programming model for the single destination System Optimum Dynamic Traffic Assignment problem	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL	Recently, Daganzo introduced the cell transmission model-a simple approach for modeling highway traffic flow consistent with the hydrodynamic model. In this paper, toe use the cell transmission model to formulate the single destination System Optimum Dynamic Traffic Assignment (SO DTA) problem as a Linear Program (LP). We demonstrate that the model can. obtain insights into the DTA problem, and we address various related issues, such as the concept of marginal travel time in a dynamic network and system optimum necessary and sufficient conditions. The model is limited to one destination and, although it can account for traffic realities as they are captured by the cell transmission model, it is not presented as an. operational model for actual applications. The main, objective of the paper is to demonstrate that the DTA problem can be modeled as an LP, which allows the vast existing literature on LP to be used to better under stand and compute DTA. A numerical example illustrates the simplicity and applicability, of the proposed approach.

It demonstrates observed features of traffic flow such as existence of three regimes: free, nonhomogeneous congested (NHC) or synchronized, and homogeneous congested (HC) or jammed flow; bistability of free and NHC flow states in a range of densities, hysteresis in transitions between these states; jumps in the density-flux plane in the NHC regime; gradual spatial transition from synchronized to free flow; long survival time of jams in the HC regime. The model predicts that in the NHC regime there exist many stable states with different wavelengths, and noise can cause transitions between them.

In order to maintain the appropriate environment in tunnels and to control and minimize the power cost for ventilation, the ventilation simulation system applicable to various longitudinal ventilation tunnels has been developed In such simulations, reproducibility of the change airflow velocity and pollution concentration in a tunnel is an important factor. However, the simulated airflow velocity tended to differ from the actually measured result particularly in a two-way tunnel. Therefore, the authors investigated the cause of the difference mainly in the reproducibility of the airflow velocity, and found out that the measuring point of the airflow velocity is one of the major problems. The airflow velocity is normally measured around the tunnel wall. In this case, however, the airflow velocity meter receives unexpected influence along the traffic flow direction from the piston driving force of vehicles. The authors installed a new type of airflow velocity meter capable of measuring the average airflow velocity of the sectional area of tunnel in order to verify the aforesaid point. This paper compares the measured data of near wall surface airflow velocity and sectional average airflow velocity with the simulated results, and explains the validity of the sectional average airflow velocity meter.

Consequently operators/owners may have inherited high operational liabilities. As the popularity of DBFO schemes grows, more emphasis is being placed on finding rounded whole life cost design solutions. In addition tunnel operators are seeking to better understand the operational costs incurred by their existing tunnels [Ref 1]. The Author has developed a comprehensive computer based calculation tool that models longitudinal ventilation energy consumption. It has been used to establish key variables and determine their sensitivity. Indicative output trends are provided based on four different tunnel types defined primarily by location turban or rural) and normal traffic flow characteristics (average day traffic profiles). Much of the output is either tabulated or shown graphically to facilitate a clear understanding of what is essentially a complex multidimensional problem. Although the model is specific to longitudinal ventilation most of the findings also relate to other forms of ventilation, particularly under Gee flowing traffic conditions.								*PIARC, 2000, IN PRESS POLL NITR D; *PIARC, 1999, ROAD TUNN RED TUNN O; PIARC, 1999, FIR SMOK CONTR ROAD; *PIARC, 1995, ROAD TUNN EM VENT EN; *WOODS AIR MOV LTD, JETF LARG JM AER FAN; 1990, NORWEGIAN DESIGN GUI	6	0	0	0	1	PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING PUBLISHING LTD	WESTMINISTER	1 BIRDCAGE WALK, WESTMINISTER SW1H 9JJ, ENGLAND			1-86058-255-9	BHR GR CONF SER PUBL			2000		43					411	+					19	Engineering, Civil; Transportation Science & Technology	Engineering; Transportation	BR37F	WOS:000166217000025					2021-01-11

In addition, possible effects evaluation of inter-vehicle communication networks (IVCN) on such running is performed. Simulation results show that by running with this behavior, the road capacity improvement and the reduction of the travel time can be achieved. Moreover, it is also shown that by using IVCN these impacts can be improved.

Based on the embedding space theory, state space reconstruction and G-P algorithm, an approach is presented to find the fractal dimension and fractal interval. Then, A series of real time traffic flow data surveyed on a freeway is analyzed by this approach. The results show that the scale has significant effects on fractal dimension and fractal interval and traffic flow is really of the invariability of scale in a certain interval.

A detailed AHS microsimulation has been combined with a comprehensive modal emissions and energy consumption model to predict emissions and energy use for a modeled highway. The resulting AHS emissions and fuel consumption are compared to non-automated traffic at different levels of congestion, as well as idealized traffic flow. The results of this preliminary evaluation have shown that an AHS has slightly lower average fuel consumption than a nonautomated highway operating at free-flow, and much lower average fuel consumption than a non-automated highway operating under congested conditions, because of its smoother traffic flow. Further, an AHS operating at 60 mph has substantially lower emissions per vehicle-mile traveled than non-automated traffic at the same average speed, again because of its smoother traffic flow. Vehicles that platoon in an AHS can expect an additional 5 - 15% fuel savings and emission reduction due to the aerodynamic drafting effect, which is dependent on the intra-platoon vehicle spacings.

Conventional steel reinforced concrete and steel decks are prone to corrosion which drastically reduces their service life. Replacement or repair of concrete bridges has also proven to be very costly, time-consuming and disruptive to traffic flow. This paper proposes a new innovative glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) bridge deck as an alternative and solution to these problems. The proposed GFRP bridge deck consists of a series of equilateral triangular tubes produced by the filament winding process and combined in specific configurations appropriate for highway bridge decks. Wardrop Engineering Inc./Faroex Ltd. have identified fundamental economic and functional improvements over existing composite technologies that are under development, and have a patent pending on their design. In the design, glass fibres and resin are wound at varying angles to achieve the most desired transverse and longitudinal strengths. Pultruded glass fibre bars and plates are combined with the modular tubes to create a single deck module. These modules are designed to be shipped to the site of the bridge and installed within a few hours. This paper provides a description of the deck, fabrication process and preliminary results of the experimental program conducted at the University of Manitoba. The deck modules are tested in simply supported conditions under a simulated wheel load and loaded to failure to examine the behaviour at service loading conditions as well as capacity and failure mode.

The results are used to define the coefficients included in the NAD (National Application Document) to be used in Spain to deduce a reliable and accurate value of the traffic actions in the Spanish bridges from the traffic load model presented in the Eurocode 1 Part 3 (Actions on Bridges). The method is based in the results from a simulation of real traffic flow in bridges representative of the most often used in the Spanish Highways with span-lengths ranging from 22 up to 150 m. The simulation software uses real traffic data recorded in the Spanish Highway system. The data bank is used in a probabilistic format according to the randomness of the traffic action. The paper shows how the inherent randomness of traffic load is deal with and applied to derive a probabilistic format of the traffic action. The results are obtained for two levels of traffic: heavy traffic (6,000 heavy trucks per day in two lanes) and light traffic (1500 heavy trucks per day). The results of the simulation are also compared with those derived from the existing. Live Load Model for Highway Bridges in Spain, showing how in some cases, the effects of the live load model could lie on the unsafe region, thus proposing the necessity of a future review and up-date.

A system dynamics approach was used to integrate three sub-models to evaluate the impact of urban NOx and HC emissions from traffic management policies. The three sub-models are the Logit model for estimating the fleet composition from user's preference, the traffic flow model for estimating vehicular speed and the traffic emission model for estimating the individual vehicular emissions from scooters, cars and buses. The application of the system to evaluate the impact of traffic management policies to Taipei City's traffic and air quality was demonstrated. Five policies, namely the exclusive bus lane, bus fare compensation, rescheduling bus route frequency in peak and normal periods and compulsory carpooling were considered in this study. The evaluation shows only compulsory carpooling and bus fare compensation policies result in reducing both NOx and HC emissions. For the rest of the policies, they result in either NOx reduction while increasing HC emissions or HC reduction while increasing NOx emissions.

Dynamic programming is used to find the optimal allocation of resources with the aim of obtaining the maximum network reliability. The result is a list with the optimal sequence of the sensitive elements of the network to be repaired for a fixed amount of economic resources. As an alternative, the amount of resources to reach a reliability-linked technical goal can be found. The next problem to be examined is the estimation of the impact of the worksites over time. Adjustments are to be made for the application of the optimality principle, especially in the definition of the objective function. The advantages of the procedure are shown in some examples, chosen from the most critical branches of the Italian highways.

Since pedestrian flow is inherently complex, even more so than vehicular flow, previous CA models developed for vehicle flow are not directly applicable. It is shown that a relatively small rule set is capable of effectively capturing the collective behaviors of pedestrians who are autonomous at the micro-level. The model provides for simulating three modes of bi-directional pedestrian flow: (a) flows in directionally separated lanes, (b) interspersed flow, and (c) dynamic multi-lane flow. The emergent behavior that arises from the model is consistent with well-established fundamental properties of pedestrian flows.

The vehicle sources were treated as both line sources and area sources to make full use of the available data. For line sources, substantial counting of vehicles on site had been conducted to determine the traffic flow and vehicle type mixture; for area sources: the total non-line-source vehicle-traveled mileage was distributed to different grids based on population density and road area in the grids. A mathematical dispersion model, Industrial Sources Complex Short Term Version 3 (ISCST3), was used to simulate the pollutant concentration distribution in urban areas based on the meteorological data and the emissions distribution mentioned above. The verification data show that method is accurate in the Beijing urban area, and the results show that the vehicle emissions in Beijing contributed significantly to the simulated pollutant impact, and the polluted areas correlate with population.

The hourly emissions are computed as a function of road type, vehicle type, fuel type, traffic volume, vehicle age, trip length distribution and the actual ambient temperature. The traffic volumes are derived from an urban traffic flow model for the city of Antwerp, which contains a network with almost 2000 road segments. The traffic flow model has been implemented in a GIS environment. The emission factors used in the model are derived from the COPERT-II methodology. Cold start emissions and evaporation losses are included in the model, Results are shown for the hourly hot- and cold start emissions obtained for CO, NOx and VOC. For these pollutants a partial validation of the model results was carried out by comparing the COPERT-II emission factors with on-the-road traffic emission measurements carried out for gasoline passenger cars with a closed-loop controlled three-way catalyst.

In this approach, the traffic flow process is macroscopically modelled by use of a second-order macroscopic traffic flow model. The overall problem of coordinated ramp metering is formulated as a constrained discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problem, and a feasible-direction nonlinear optimisation algorithm is employed for its numerical solution. The control strategy's efficiency is demonstrated through its application to the 32 km Amsterdam ring-road for a number of different scenarios. The results of the presented approach are very promising and demonstrate the efficiency of the optimal control methodology for motorway traffic control problems. Copyright (C) IFAC 2000.

Transportat Res Board			EMISSIONS	Metropolitan areas in nonattainment for transportation-related air pollutants rely on transportation control measures (TCMs) to reduce emissions and meet clean-air goals. However, since traditional transportation-related air quality models use emission rates based on average speeds, only TCMs that either increase or decrease vehicle activity to speeds in which emissions are lower show reductions in output of air pollutants. In recent years, transportation air quality analysis has shifted to an activity-specific modeling approach that correlates emissions to vehicle operating mode. With an activity-specific approach, the emission reduction potential of a TCM can be evaluated by its ability to decrease time spent in modes in which emissions are disproportionately elevated. Signal timing improvements are attractive TCMs for traffic flow improvement. However, with traditional modeling, they may greatly decrease extremes in modal activity yet not show significant emission reduction if only moderate changes in average speed are realized. The benefits of using activity-specific modeling for evaluation of improved signal coordination as a TCM are described. A brief overview of the development of an activity-specific carbon monoxide emission rate model is provided, data collection for on-road vehicle activity estimates Is briefly outlined, and a comparison of traditional emission modeling versus activity-specific modeling is provided to estimate the air quality benefits from improved coordination at a study intersection.

Transportat Res Board				A method is proposed that applies an artificial neural network model to estimate an origin-destination (O-D) matrix for a freeway network for which the data on inflow and outflow at the ramps are gathered regularly. This problem is the same as estimating the elements of an O-D table, given that many sets of data about the right-hand column total (trip production) and the bottom row total (trip attraction) are available. A neural network model is developed to emulate the stimulus-response process on the freeway traffic, in which the stimulus is the inflow at the entrance ramps and the response the outflow at the exit ramps, After the neural network of a particular structure is trained by many sets of data (e.g., sets of daily volumes), the weights of the neural network are found to represent the ramp-to-ramp volume expressed in the proportion of the in-flow at the corresponding ramps. The model is applied to estimate a ramp-to-ramp O-D table for the Tokyo expressway network. The result is compared with the actual O-D table obtained from a survey. The model is round to be useful not only for estimating the O-D volume with much less data than for the traditional method, but also for verifying the existence of a pattern in the traffic flow.

Transportat Res Board			TRAFFIC FLOW	A model was formulated for estimating dynamic origin-destination (O-D) travel time and flow on a long freeway with a neural Kalman filter originally developed by the authors. The model predicts O-D travel times and flows simultaneously by using traffic detector data such as link traffic volumes, spot speeds, and off-ramp volumes. The model is based on a Kalman filter that consists of two equations: state and measurement. First, the state and measurement equations of the Kalman filter were modified to consider the influence of traffic states for some previous time steps. Then artificial neural network models were integrated with the Kalman filter to enable nonlinear formulations of the state and measurement equations. Finally, a macroscopic traffic flow simulation model was introduced to simulate traffic states on a freeway in advance and predict traffic variables such as O-D travel times, link traffic volumes, spot speeds, and off-ramp volumes. The new model was compared with a regression Kalman filter in which the state and measurement equations are defined by regression models. The numerical analysis indicated that the new model was capable of estimating nonlinearity of dynamic O-D travel time and flow and helped to improve their estimation precision under free-flow traffic states as well as congested flow states.

The focus is on the methodology adopted for analysis of the old existing bridges. Because information about bridge properties (geometry, material strength) and design live load is unknown, the evaluation procedure combines the information provided by in situ measurements and inspection with a reliability-based evaluation. The reliability index for the most critical limit states derived from the maximum effects due to actual traffic on the bridge is adopted as the comparison value to define a passage criterion. Any permit crossing the bridge alone or with traffic restrictions leading to a lower reliability index will not be allowed on the bridge. The actual traffic load is obtained from existing traffic records using a model of traffic flow. The method is applied to 10 bridges fully representative of the old and nondocumented bridges most often encountered on Spanish highways. The final result is definition of the standard permits as presented in Eurocode 1 that are allowed on the bridge. From the most unfavorable permit, a criterion is derived concerning the actual vehicle permits.

Transportat Res Board				Traffic control and travelers' behavior are two mutually influential processes with different objectives. Decisions made in traffic control influence travelers' possibilities in choosing their preferred mode, route, and time of departure; and the choices made by travelers influence the optimization possibilities for traffic control. This research presents the results of simulation studies and a mathematical analysis of this bilevel optimization problem. Under certain conditions, multiple stable situations are possible, but some of these situations are sensitive to small disturbances by which the system moves away from the original equilibrium state. There appears to be a nonlinear relationship between system parameters and the character and location of the equilibrium situations. The details of the travel time model appear to have a large influence. If road authorities want to optimize traffic control, they have to anticipate the reaction of travelers. This makes the optimization process much more complicated. Iterative optimization, where traffic control is adjusted as soon as traffic conditions change, generally does not lead to a system optimum. Methods are therefore necessary that allow for the optimization of traffic control while taking into account that traffic flows will change as a result of traffic control.

Transportat Res Board			LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; LEAST-SQUARES; REGRESSION	Accident prediction models (APMs) are useful tools for estimating the expected number of accidents on entities such as intersections and road sections. These estimates typically are used in the identification of sites for possible safety treatment and in the evaluation of such treatments. An APM is, in essence, a mathematical equation that expresses the average accident frequency of a site as a function of traffic flow and other site characteristics. The reliability of an APM estimate is enhanced if the APM is based on data for as many years as possible, especially if data for those same years are used in the safety analysis of a site. With many years of data, however, it is necessary to account for the year-to-year variation, or trend, in accident counts because of the influence of factors that change every year. To capture this variation, the count for each year is treated as a separate observation. Unfortunately, the disaggregation of the data in this manner creates a temporal correlation that presents difficulties for traditional model calibration procedures. An application is presented of a generalized estimating equations (GEE) procedure to develop an APM that incorporates trend in accident data. Data for the application pertain to a sample of four-legged signalized intersections in Toronto, Canada, for the years 1990 through 1995. The GEE model incorporating the time trend is shown to be superior to models that do not accommodate trend and/or the temporal correlation in accident data.

These systems are expected to be more effective and more economical than conventional surveillance systems. In this paper, we describe the design of a traffic surveillance system, called Multimedia Traffic Monitoring System. The system is based on a client/server model, with the following main modules: 1) video image capture module (VICM), 2) video image processing module (VIPM), and 3) database module (DBM). The VICM is used to capture the live feed from a digital camera. Depending on the mode of the operation, VICM either: 1) sends the video images directly to the VIPM ton the same processing node), or 2) compresses the video images and sends them to the VIPM and/or the DBM on separate processing node(s). The main contribution of this paper is the design of a traffic monitoring system that uses image processing (VIPM) to estimate traffic flow. In the current implementation, VIPM estimates the number of vehicles per kilometer, while using 9 image sequences (at a rate of 4 frames per second). The VIPM algorithm generates a virtual grid and superimposes it on a part of the traffic scene. Motion and vehicle detection operators are carried out within each cell in the grid Vehicle count is concluded based on the 9 images of a sequence. The system is tested against a manual count of more than 40 image sequences (total of more than 365 traffic images) of various traffic situations. The results show that the system is able to determine the traffic flow with a precision of For All1.5 vehicle per kilometer.

J	Zhang, HM				Zhang, HM			Phase transitions in nonequilibrium traffic theory	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							FLOW	This paper uses the center difference scheme of Lax-Friedrichs to numerically solve a newly developed continuum traffic flow theory and the kinematic theory of Lighthill and Whitham, and Richards, and it studies the flow-concentration phase transitions in flow containing both shock and rarefaction waves. A homogeneous road with finite length was modeled by both theories. Numerical simulations show that both theories yield nearly identical results for two representative Riemann problems-one has a shock solution and the other a rarefaction wave solution. Their phase transition curves, however, are different: those derived from the new theory have two branches-one for acceleration flow and one for deceleration flow, whereas those derived from the LWR theory comprise a single curve-the equilibrium curve. The phase transition curves in the shock case agree well with certain experimental observations but disagree with others. This disagreement may be resolved by studying transitions among nonequilibrium states, which awaits further development of a more accurate finite difference approximation of the nonequilibrium theory.

J	Hasan, MK; Safwat, KNA				Hasan, MK; Safwat, KNA			Comparison of two transportation network equilibrium modeling approaches	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							TRIP DISTRIBUTION; ASSIGNMENT	Existing methodologies for predicting traffic flows on transportation networks involve a sequential process, often with four stages: trip generation, trip distribution, modal split, and traffic assignment. Although the sequential approach has been applied to hundreds of transportation studies throughout the world for the last four decades, and is still being used in practice today, it has an inherent weakness. That is, its predictions need not be internally consistent. This deficiency has motivated attempts to predict all four steps simultaneously. The objective of this paper is to compare the simultaneous approach, using a Simultaneous Transportation Equilibrium Model (STEM) and the conventional sequential approach, using the Texas Demand Model developed and implemented by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). This was achieved by applying STEM to the urban transportation network of Tyler, Tex., and then comparing the accuracy of the resulting traffic network flows with the "official" TxDOT estimates. The application results showed that predictions of STEM were consistently better than those of the TxDOT by an average improvement of 25%. These results are certainly encouraging in terms of future application of STEM methodology to other real-world large-scale transportation networks.

Since a route guidance system can only recommend paths to the drivers, special care has to be taken not to route them over paths they perceive as too long. This leads in a simplified model to a nonlinear multicommodity flow problem with constraints on the available paths. In this article an algorithm for this problem is given, which combines the convex combinations algorithm by Frank and Wolfe with column generation and algorithms for the constrained shortest path problem. Computational results stemming from a cooperation with DaimlerChrysler are presented.

J	Muramatsu, H; Nagatani, T				Muramatsu, H; Nagatani, T			Jamming transition in two-dimensional pedestrian traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						pedestrian traffic; traffic flow; phase transition	FLOW MODEL; SELF-ORGANIZATION; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DYNAMICS; JAMS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION; HIGHWAY; RULES	Jamming transitions of pedestrian traffic are investigated under the periodic boundary condition on the square lattice by the use of the lattice gas model of biased random walkers without the back step. The two cases are presented: the one with two types of walkers and the other with four types of walkers. In the two types of walkers, the first is the random walker going to the right and the second is the random walker going up. In the four types of walkers, the first, second, third, and fourth are, respectively, the random walkers going; to the right, left, up, and down. It is found that the dynamical jamming transitions occur at the critical densities. The transition points do not depend on the system size for large system but depend strongly on the strength of drift. The jamming transitions are compared with that obtained by the cellular automaton model of car traffic. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The control policy is analyzed for a circular highway using three different traffic models, namely a microscopic model, a spatially discrete model, and a spatially continuous model. it is shown that the traffic dynamics will not be qualitatively consistent across the three modeling paradigms if a consistent biasing strategy is not used to adapt the constant time headway policy. The biasing strategy determines whether the feedback quantity for use in the control, is taken colocatedly, downstream or upstream to the vehicle / section / highway location. For ACC vehicles equipped with forward looking sensors, the downstream biasing strategy should be used. In this case, the constant time headway policy induces exponentially stable traffic how on a circular highway in all three modeling frameworks.

The VRC system utilizes radio frequency communications between a tag installed in a vehicle and a reader installed on the roadside. A driver with a tag capable of digital messaging activation can report an incident to the responsible highway agency via the roadside reader. The FRESIM (FREeway SIMulation) model was used to simulate shoulder and lane-blocking incidents occurring under various traffic flow rates. The proportion of tagged vehicles in the general vehicle population and the degree of the drivers' reporting propensity were introduced as controlled variables. A binomial probability model was applied to determine the probability of an incident being reported by drivers who passed an incident. The results show that all simulated incidents were detected in a short time with high probability of detection. It was found that in periods of moderate to heavy traffic flow, more than 80 percent of the simulated incidents can be detected in less than two minutes if 1 out of 100 vehicles on a freeway has a tag. The detection rate improved to 100 percent when 1 out of 10 vehicles had a tag. It is noteworthy that at the end of 1995 approximately 1 out of 100 registered vehicles in the Houston, Texas metropolitan area had a tag.

These systems are generally regarded as a promising tool to alleviate congestion (by improving road network performance) and improve safety and driver's comfort. Especially alleviating congestion and improving safety have the attention of the Dutch government. To assess the impact of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems on traffic flow and traffic safety the methodology of virtual Technology Assessment can be used. This methodology comprises modelling and computer simulation. This paper concerns the analysis of the concept of Go-operative Following (CF) and External Cruise Control (ECC) on Highways with the microscopic traffic flow model;MIXIC. The simulation of ECC in traffic flows shows a decrease in throughput and positive effects on safety when ECC is introduced. The simulation of CF led to the identification of those elements in the design of the CF system that are crucial for adequate functioning.

J	Rhodes, CJ				Rhodes, CJ			Fluctuation analysis of M25 loop data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART D-JOURNAL OF AUTOMOBILE ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow; scaling; fluctuation analysis; fractional Brownian motion	TRAFFIC-FLOW	By calculating exponents relating to the flow velocity of traffic on the M25 motorway in the United Kingdom, evidence is given for scale-free behaviour in the dynamics of traffic at near-capacity flow. Specifically, it is demonstrated that during periods of high demand the flow is well described by a strongly antipersistent fractional Brownian motion. This approach to traffic flow analysis provides a robust and accurate quantitative characterization of the flow which can be used to inform choices of traffic flow prediction methods.

The network of city reads is implemented in a double-bond square lattice, instead of a usual single-bond square lattice; we assume that each bond has five decorated sites. A car or an obstacle is assumed to be located at one of those decorated sites or lattice sites. Two types (mu and nu types) of cars are assumed; cars of mu type (nu type) move mainly to the positive a: (y) direction and change their direction to the positive y (x) direction with a probability. What we found is that a traffic jam is formed more easily for obstacles placed close to traffic signals in the traffic flow direction than for those in the other cases.

In this paper a modeling method is described that is suitable for the application in all models that are based on a speed-density relationship, without requiring a new calibration of them. The basic concept is to vary two parameters of the speed density relationship, the free-flow speed and the maximal density, as a function of the percentage of trucks on the road. The determination of two functions describing this relationship and their application to a macroscopic traffic flow model is the main purpose of this paper.

In that model, each car controls its speed toward an optimal (safety) value depending on the headway We construct a new car following type simulation model for traffic flow in a coupled map form based on optimal velocity functions. We can simulate open road systems with the model. The emergence of weakly congested flow induced by noise is investigated. We observe the enhancement of the car density induced by noise.

In real traffic, measurements are mostly collected at local points, from sensors like loops, infrared sensors, or video cameras. To get the overall state of a traffic system, online traffic simulations or traffic state estimations are used. This paper focuses on the main differences between these two approaches. An example with real traffic data shows, that the state estimation can cope better with inaccurate initial conditions and measurement errors.

In this contribution, a framework for on-line simulations of freeways is proposed. It is based on cellular automaton models which are supplemented by real world traffic data stemming from about 2,500 inductive loops distributed over the freeway network of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). We propose and analyse different methods to tune the simulation with regard to the real world measurements. The possibility of a short-term traffic forecast is discussed.

We introduce a new variable called order parameter that accounts for possible correlations in the vehicle motion at different lanes. So, it is principally due to "many-body" effects in the car interaction in contrast to such variables as the mean car density and velocity being actually the zeroth and first moments of the "one-particle" distribution function. Therefore, we regard the order parameter as an additional independent state variable of traffic flow and formulate the corresponding evolution equation governing the lane changing rate. In this context we analyze the instability of homogeneous traffic how manifesting itself in both of these phase transitions and endowing them with the hysteresis.

The model takes each individual car into account with its individual features and actual situations so that a distribution of parameters as well as different behavior can easily be analyzed. Therefore, a detailed study of certain situations, driving tactics, vehicle properties, and their influence on the global traffic flow can be performed. The model and first results are discussed, namely, the influence of the driver behavior on the fundamental diagram.

We have extended the stochastic theory of freeway traffic allowing a coexistence of many clusters on a one-lane circular road. Analytical equations have been derived for calculation of the stationary cluster distribution and related physical quantities of an infinitely large system of interacting cars. If the probability per time to decelarate a car without an obvious reason tends to zero in an infinitely large system, our multi-cluster model behaves essentially in the same way as the one-cluster model presented at TRAFFIC AND GRANULAR FLOW '97. In particular, there are three different regimes of traffic flow (free jet of cars, coexisting phase of jams and isolated cars, highly viscous heavy traffic) and two phase transitions between them. In a general case, some qualitative differences in the behaviour of these two models have been observed.

The agents are considered as a kind of artificial life (A-Life) and they behave based on their own knowledge independently. Driven, vehicles, roads and traffic environment, which are essential elements in our simulation, are defined as the agents. The vehicle agent combined with a driver agent works based on driver's region of sight and their own characteristics. The road agent communicates with the vehicle agent responding velocity, position of the vehicle. The effectiveness of our new method for modeling the traffic now is shown by simulation study.

TARA (Traffic and Road Analysis) is an innovative mettled of estimating the performance of a two lane rural highway traffic system. TARA is a software package that uses both Psychology and Fuzzy Logic to accurately model the behaviour of human drivers on a road network in order to estimate the Passing Hazard Index. This paper describes a project that analyzed the effect of increasing the truck length front 25m to 31m on passing opportunities on a typical Canadian rural highway. Traffic and site specific data was measured in the field through traffic counts and physical measurements of the road characteristics. Driving procedures and Vehicle characteristics data were collected from literature. The traffic flow model used was TARA, Traffic and Road Analysis. The baseline Passing Hazard Index for 25 m trucks running at 105 km/hr was estimated. The scenario was then changed: truck length was increased to 31 nl and the number of trucks was reduced by 18%; truck speed was kept constant at 105 km/h. The Passing Hazard Index was estimated for the new scenario. The results were compared to baseline results. nle procedure was repeated for a range of truck speeds. nle paper reports in detail the following: Effect of increasing the truck length from 25m to 31m on the average pass time The effect on passing time of truck speeds The cumulative time spent passing the various trucks modeled The impact of driver behaviour on the results.

Transportat Res Board			TRAFFIC FLOW	Deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and availability of a vast amount of online data are opening new opportunities for researchers and practitioners. Many of the previously established methods and applications must be revisited in light of the availability of real-time data. Traffic flow models, particularly speed-density relations, lie at the core of a wide range of applications in almost all areas of traffic engineering and control. In simulation applications and continuum traffic flow models, first-order models use a steady-state or static speed-density relation, whereas higher-order models, with additional terms and parameters, are usually driven by the deviation of speed from this steady-state value. In calibrating speed-density relations using time series data, the existence of serial correlation and other dynamic effects in the data has largely been ignored in previous studies. In this study, transfer function methods (bivariate time series models) are used to specify and estimate dynamic speed-density relations from typical detector data from an advanced traffic management system control center. First the deviation of speed from an equilibrium static relation is estimated, and later the method is extended to directly estimate speed without explicit specification of an equilibrium speed-density relation. The robustness of the model temporally and spatially is investigated. In all cases considered, the method exhibits good performance and robustness in application. Furthermore, since the method is based on the use of online information, it has the capability of being adaptive and adjusting its parameters online.

Transportat Res Board				Advanced traffic management systems (ATMS) and advanced traveler information systems (ATIS) are promising technologies for achieving efficiency in the operation of transportation systems. A simulation-based laboratory environment, MITSIMLab, is presented that is designed for testing and evaluation of dynamic traffic management systems. The core of MITSIMLab is a microscopic traffic simulator (MITSIM) and a traffic management simulator (TMS). MITSIM represents traffic flows in the network, and the TMS represents the traffic management system under evaluation. An important feature of MITSIMLab is its ability to model ATMS or ATIS that generate traffic controls and route guidance based on predicted traffic conditions. A graphical user interface allows visualization of the simulation, including animation of vehicle movements. An ATIS case study with a realistic network is also presented to demonstrate the functionality of MITSIMLab.

Transportat Res Board				Several measures of effectiveness (MOEs) are associated with the queuing process at traffic signals, including delay, number of stops, fuel con. sumption, emissions, and queue length. The focus in this study is on queue length in general and on the storage requirements for left turns in particular. Queue length is an important MOE because queues that overflow the available storage space have an adverse effect on the overall operation of the intersection. Many traffic models now provide queue-length estimates, but the procedures used by these models are based on,different queue definitions and have different computational approaches that lead to different results. A classification framework is developed for the existing models, their behavior is compared with that of the proposed Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) 2000 queue model, and queue conversion factors are provided for translating the various model outputs to their HCM 2000 equivalent The proposed HCM 2000 model and its parent model from the Signalized and Unsignalized Intersection Design and Research Aid (SIDRA) provide a comprehensive treatment of the queuing process, accounting for control parameters such as controller type and progression quality as well as for the random and overflow effects associated with traffic flow. As such, the queue-length estimates from these models are more analytically defensible than those of the simpler theoretical models. The SIDRA and HCM 2000 queue estimates are generally higher than those of most other models and are somewhat higher than what conventional wisdom would suggest. It is suggested as a result of the comparisons presented that the queue estimates from some models are unduly optimistic when demand approaches capacity and that a goal of 90 percent confidence in the adequacy of left-turn storage lanes may be difficult to achieve under these conditions.

Transportat Res Board				Public transit and general traffic on many urban arterials are controlled by the same set of signals and must compete for shared road space. In these situations, transit vehicles typically face considerable delays because their dwell times at transit stops remove them from the coordinated green wave for general traffic flow. Although existing control systems allow for local adjustments of signal timings to provide transit priority, these short-term actions often contradict the network control scheme and may preclude a priority scheme or significantly disrupt traffic flow. A new concept for a corridor control system is introduced-the dynamic right-of-way, which serves the demands of public transit and general traffic using an integrated model for evaluation and optimization. The control system is intended to (a) reduce critical interferences between both modes of transport by dynamically controlling inflow and outflow for all network links, (b) provide a green signal whenever a transit vehicle approaches an intersection, and (c) minimize general traffic disruption by maintaining overall signal coordination. Through linking an event-based simulator with a genetic algorithm-based optimization routine, delay-minimizing multicycle signal control schemes are calculated. In offline experiments, the potential for achieving substantial reductions in delays is demonstrated. Finally, a method is presented by which these control schemes are implemented and adjusted dynamically, based on online measurements and a control modification function derived from a neural network model.

Transportat Res Board				Application of a dynamic traffic assignment-simulation methodology to the analysis and evaluation of network performance under various schemes for the design and operation of high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes is described. The DYNASMART traffic simulation-assignment model, which combines the ability to simulate traffic flow and to represent dynamic route choice behavior, is used to model the problem. Different dimensions for the design and operation of HOT lanes are considered in this study, including (a) lane utilization in terms of adding a new lane or using an existing lane of the facility as a HOT lane; (b) physical separation of the HOT lane in terms of access point frequency; (c) access restriction based on vehicle occupancy; (d) HOT lane pricing structure, which may be fixed or congestion dependent; and (e) different demand levels with different percentages of high-occupancy vehicles (HOV). A set of experiments was designed to compare the performance of the HOT lanes and the total network under these different operating characteristics. A network in Texas that represents the south central part of the Fort Worth area is used in these experiments. The results were analyzed under each of these different operating characteristics, yielding useful insights for the design and evaluation of HOT lanes.

The time between arrivals of successive vehicles passing a point on roadway is called vehicle headway. This study aims at analyzing the vehicle headway for urban freeway and arterial roadway sections in Riyadh (capital of Saudi Arabia) and comparing them with results from international research. Only low volume traffic conditions is of the concern in this research. The paper describes the mathematical distribution for vehicle headway data on two types of roadways (freeways and arterials). The study found that shifted exponential distribution and gamma distribution appear to reasonably fit data from freeways and atrerials, respectively.

Because of the dynamic interaction between urban transport and land use, of relevant scale- and time-indivisibilities, and of long-lasting effects of urban infrastructure network, accuracy in demand forecasts is more and more crucial for planning transport infrastructure networks in this phase of urban life-cycle. The paper includes results of a case study concerning the city of Genoa, where re-urbanisation is apparently emerging in recent years, with relevant consequences on transport demand and infrastructural system. The case study includes the analysis and comparison of two infrastructural projects connecting East and West districts across the inner city. Since the feasibility of these projects is partially based on tolls, the road pricing hypothesis is fully considered, in order to assess its effects on the demand curve, traffic flows and revenues.

HUTSIM is designed especially for simulating signal-controlled intersections and small areas consisting of several intersections. In 1997 a measuring campaign was conducted in a street canyon (Runeberg's St.) in Helsinki. Hourly concentrations of CO, NOX, NO2 and O-3 were measured at street and roof levels. The relevant hourly meteorological parameters were measured at roof level; these included wind speed and direction, temperature and solar radiation. Hourly street level measurements and on-site electronic traffic counts were conducted throughout the whole of 1997; roof level measurements were conducted for approximately two months, from 3(rd) Of March to 30(th) of April, 1997. The above mentioned location and time (the year 1997) are considered also in this study, in order to be able to compare the simulation results with measured traffic flow and concentration values, as well as the corresponding previous computational results. The results of flow and emission computations obtained with the two modelling systems, involving traffic micro- and macrosimulation models, were first compared with each other. The predicted atmospheric pollutant concentrations were then compared with the measured data. The results were promising.

The measurements from all three DOAS stations (two - roof-level stations, one - street-level station) are compared. The strong correlation was found between data of ozone and nitrogen dioxide pollution from all three stations. It is concluded that air monitoring on roof level as well as on street level in Riga corresponds very well to the traffic motion in the city. Nevertheless the pollution with toluene and ozone too are much higher on roof level. AIRVIRO air quality control and management system in Riga City Council is used from 1992. Information databases about traffic intensity in streets and different point and square pollution sources (plants, factories, heating enterprises and different types of boilers, including private houses) are collected throughout of all Riga. The Old Town of Riga is the most popular place for tourists, crowded by businessmen and members of Parliament, and full of motor vehicles as well. There are intensive traffic flows on all four sides of the Old Town, in particular the bank of the Daugava River, where heavy traffic is going to the Riga harbour. There are number of complaints about air quality from residents in Old Town and acid rain damaged architectural monuments - buildings from the 15 - 19 centuries. During the last 10 years the number of vehicles in Riga has increased twofold. The present situation in the Old Town has become critical. Different ways of improving the air quality in the Old Town of Riga are proposed by model calculations. The research tests the hypothesis that it is possible to reduce air pollution in the Old Town of Riga by mitigating the heavy traffic around the Old.

The measurements were carried out on a main street with high traffic flows in the city centre. The concentration of carbon monoxide, which is directly related to road traffic, was monitored continuously; the meteorological data with the greatest influence on the analysed phenomenon, wind direction and speed, were also recorded; traffic flows on working days and holidays were estimated on the base of an extensive sampling campaign. The air quality in the location which was the object of study resulted quite low; in many cases the limit value expected on an average of eight hours (10 mg/m(3) = 8 p.p.m) was exceeded, and even if the health limit on a single hour (40 mg/m(3) = 30 p.p.m.) was never reached, a peak was reached with a mean hour value of 31 mg/m(3), thus exceeding the alarm limit. A regressive model and an emission model were implemented and calibrated by the measured data. The application of both models gave reliable results which were in good accordance, clearly indicating the relation between road traffic, meteorological conditions and air pollution.

An optimal control problem is stated for variable-speed signaling in order to improve traffic behavior near congestion, A traffic state estimator based on the extended Kalman filter is designed to generate realtime estimates of the traffic density and, by means of these ones, to activate speed signaling. The variable-speed signaling control law is closed loop and is set by minimizing (or maximizing) a performance criterion. The optimization procedure is based on Powell's method, and its off-line execution has resulted computationally tractable on low-cost computers too. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach for preventing and reducing congestion.

J	Mahmoud, MED; El-Araby, K				Mahmoud, MED; El-Araby, K			A robust dynamic highway traffic simulation model	COMPUTERS & INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING			English	Article								In this paper, a dynamic macroscopic traffic simulation model was developed based on a high-order continuum-modeling scheme using Boltzman-like analogy between traffic and gases to respond to high-density and low-density traffic flows. In addition, a queuing-based equilibrium speed-density relationship was implemented to reflect a wide scope of traffic phenomena. The developed traffic simulation model was shown to robustly predict and respond to a wide variety of traffic conditions on a real-time basis. The model provides information on expected traffic flow elements both on a statistical framework and network display format, a fundamental element in transport telematics applications. Results of the model application on the Munich network show the developed model to produce more reliable traffic performance estimates than those developed by other continuum-based simulation models.

This model consists of a lead vehicle and following vehicles, which have a piecewise linear optimal velocity function. When the lead-vehicle speed is varied, we can observe a traffic jam in the group of the vehicles. We derive a condition under which the traffic jam never occurs in our model. Furthermore, in order to suppress the traffic jam, for each vehicle we use a dynamic version of decentralized delayed-feedback control proposed in [Konishi, Hirai, and Kokame, Phys. Rev. E 58, 3055 (1998)], and provide a systematic procedure for designing the controller. [S1063-651X(99)12410-3].

J	Lan, CJ; Davis, GA				Lan, CJ; Davis, GA			Real-time estimation of turning movement proportions from partial counts on urban networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						turning movement proportions; partial counts; recursive estimation; Markovian traffic flow model	ORIGIN-DESTINATION FLOWS; MATRICES	Modern traffic signal control systems require reliable estimates of turning flows in real time to formulate effective control actions, and accommodate disturbances in traffic demand without deteriorating the system performance. The more accurate the estimation is, the more effective the control plan is. Most of the previous research works assumed that a full set of detector counts is available and employed the least-squares methods to produce unbiased estimates of the turning movement proportions. However, in practice, such a dense detector configuration is expensive to install and maintain. Also, the least-squares estimates are not feasible when the travel time between inflows and outflows is significant, or when intervening traffic conditions change the travel time. This study proposes a nonlinear least-square (NLS) approach and a quasi maximum likelihood (QML) approach to recursively estimate turning movement proportions in a network of intersections where only a partial set of detector counts are available. Using large population approximation technique, a class of nonlinear, discrete-time traffic flow models are transformed into a linear state-space model tractable for on-line applications. The quality of estimates is demonstrated by implementing the proposed algorithms with simulation and real data. As a comparison, the NLS estimator shows less bias but with higher variance than the QML estimator. The QML estimator outperforms the NLS estimator in terms of total mean square error, due to an increase in bias being traded for a decrease in variance. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Alvarez, L; Horowitz, R; Li, P				Alvarez, L; Horowitz, R; Li, P			Traffic flow control in automated highway systems	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						traffic control; velocity control; partial differential equations; automated guided vehicles; Lyapunov stability		The problem of vehicle traffic flow control in automated highway systems is analyzed. Given desired vehicular density and velocity profiles along a highway, stabilizing velocity controllers are designed so that the real vehicle traffic flow converges to the desired profiles. The controllers are derived using vehicle conservation flow models and Lyapunov stability techniques. A highway topology with a discrete number of lanes is considered. Vehicles can have different destinations and perform diverse maneuvers.

In that model, each car controls its speed toward an optimal (safety) velocity, which depends only on the headway. We constructed a new car-following type simulation model for traffic flow in a coupled map form based on the optimal velocity model. We can easily simulate open road systems with the model. The emergence of weakly congested Row induced by noise is investigated. We observe the enhancement of the car density induced by noise. The strong traffic jun hardly occurs in open road systems. We discuss the problems of unrealistic acceleration in the optimal velocity model and the possibility of spontaneous formation of strong traffic jams.

The perceived annoyance impact of traffic noise on a sample of 1,182 exposed residents is described. Principal factor analysis, correlation analysis, and stepwise linear/nonlinear regressions are employed to investigate how well perceptions and noise levels correlate. The mean equivalent noise level was strongly and positively correlated with the total traffic volume, the mean travel speed, and roadway class. The mean equivalent noise levels, measured at distances equivalent to where the residents Live, also demonstrated positive and significant correlations with sleeping, reading, resting, telephone conversation, and watching TV-the main welfare indicators of residents' annoyance. Investigations mainly focus on likely relationships between exposed residents' annoyance and measured traffic noise levels. Results indicate that exposure to higher traffic noise levels was naturally associated with increasing annoyance. Residents were most annoyed with noise from traffic at collector streets.

It is shown that the jamming transition between the freely moving and jammed phases depends on the configuration of car moving directions, It is found that the three distinct jamming transitions occur: the conventional jamming transition to the kink jams, the jamming transition to the chaotic jams, and the jamming transition to the oscillating jams, The conventional jamming transition to the kink jams is analyzed by the use of the linear stability theory and the nonlinear method. The coexisting curve between the freely moving and jammed phases is calculated from the solution of the modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Micallef, A; Colls, JJ				Micallef, A; Colls, JJ			Measuring and modelling the airborne particulate matter mass concentration field in the street environment: model overview and evaluation	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						street canyon; dispersion modelling; emission modelling; urban air quality	TURBULENCE; CANYON	This paper discusses the outline structure and preliminary evaluation of an emission-dispersion model for predicting the temporal and spatial distribution of vehicle-derived airborne particulate matter mass concentration in street canyons. The model is called Street Level Air Quality (SLAQ). SLAQ is semi-empirical, in that it uses not only results from field and wind tunnel experiments but also theory and models derived from multiple runs of numerical routines in order to simulate the basic physical processes within the street canyon. A combination of a plume model, for the direct contribution of vehicle exhaust, and a box model for the recirculating part of the pollutants in the street, is used to predict concentration for receptors within the canyon. Emission rates of vehicle-derived particulate. matter are calculated within SLAQ, which serve as input to the dispersion module. Exhaust emission rates are scaled element by element along the street for each of the lanes according to the direction of traffic flow to account for modal operation of vehicles near signalised intersections. This refinement allows SLAQ to account for non-uniformity in along-canyon emission rates and to model a street that has several intersections along its length. Thermal turbulence due to environmental surface sensible heat and vehicle-generated heat is accounted for in the model. Other features of SLAQ include correction for the urban heat island effect, dry deposition, wet deposition, particle settling and estimation of wind direction standard deviation, when this latter data is not available. SLAQ has been evaluated in a street in Loughborough, Leicestershire, United Kingdom and a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the modelled and measured concentrations has been obtained.

J	Inoue, T; Futamura, M; Yokota, T; Sano, Y				Inoue, T; Futamura, M; Yokota, T; Sano, Y			Traffic signal offset design using event scanning method simulation of traffic congestion	ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATIONS IN JAPAN PART III-FUNDAMENTAL ELECTRONIC SCIENCE			English	Article						road traffic; traffic signal; simulation; offset; oversaturated traffic; event scanning		Recently the congestion of traffic has been a growing problem, and it is desirable to make traffic smooth. As a means to smooth traffic flow, the offset, that is, the difference in the phase between signals, can be controlled. Although the offset can be calculated using a trapezoidal projecting method or the TRANSYT offset design tool in off-peak traffic, it has been configured based on the experience of operators with congested traffic. Based an this, we have prepared an offset design tool applicable to congested traffic. At first, as simple a model as possible was used to reproduce the traffic conditions in the simulation, and the estimation of events was investigated by applying the event scanning method. An experiment conducted with this design tool on the Nagoya-Nagakute Highway in Aichi prefecture confirmed that the major-road travel time of about 540 seconds formerly required was shortened to about 340 seconds in the peak morning hour, so that the traffic congestion on the major road during the morning rush hour was relieved.

J	Schadschneider, A				Schadschneider, A			The Nagel-Schreckenberg model revisited	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW MODELS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; HEADWAYS; JAMS	The Nagel-Schreckenberg model is a simple cellular automaton for a realistic description of single-lane traffic on highways. For the case v(max) = 1 the properties of the stationary state can be obtained exactly. For the more relevant case v(max) > 1, however, one has to rely on Monte Carlo simulations or approximative methods. Here we study several analytical approximations and compare with the results of computer simulations. The role of the braking parameter p is emphasized. It is shown how the local structure of the stationary state depends on the value of p. This is done by combining the results of computer simulations with those of the approximative methods.

J	Nam, DH; Drew, DR				Nam, DH; Drew, DR			Automatic measurement of traffic variables for intelligent transportation systems applications	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						traffic flow models; travel time estimations; stochastic process; conservation of vehicles; cumulative flows; ITS	DYNAMICS	This paper presents a methodology for automatic measurement of major traffic variables for Intelligent Transportation Systems applications (ITS) in real-time. It is an illustration of the integration of theory, measurement, and application. Such effort has been overlooked since the advent of ITS due to the number of different disciplines involved. The inductive methodology adopted in this study includes the development of a new dynamic traffic flow model which is based on the characteristics of the stochastic vehicle counting process and the principle of conservation of vehicles. The model estimates spatial traffic variables, such as link travel times, as a function of time directly from flow measurements. It satisfies the traffic dynamics through a new form of the equation of conservation of vehicles. Analysis results show that the estimates are in qualitative and quantitative agreement with empirical data aggregated at 2-min intervals. The advantages of this inductive model include real-time applicability, computational efficiency, and transportability over traditional deductive models such as continuum flow models. It appears to be promising in applying to real world problems. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Huberman, BA; Helbing, D				Huberman, BA; Helbing, D			Economics-based optimization of unstable flows	EUROPHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; MODEL; JAMS	As an example for the optimization of unstable flows, we present an economics-based method for deciding the optimal rates at which vehicles are allowed to enter a highway. It exploits the naturally occurring fluctuations of traffic flow and is flexible enough to adapt in real time to the transient flow characteristics of road traffic. Simulations based on realistic parameter values show that, this strategy is feasible for naturally occurring traffic, and that even far from optimality, injection policies can improve traffic flow. Moreover, the same method can be applied to the optimization of flows of gases and granular media.

J	Muramatsu, M; Nagatani, T				Muramatsu, M; Nagatani, T			Soliton and kink jams in traffic flow with open boundaries	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							JAMMING TRANSITION; MODEL; CONGESTION; HIGHWAY	Soliton density :wave is investigated numerically and analytically in the optimal velocity model (a car-following model) of a one-dimensional traffic flow with open boundaries. Soliton density wave is distinguished from the kink density wave. It is shown that the soliton density wave appears only at the threshold of occurrence of traffic jams. The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived from the optimal velocity model by the use of the nonlinear analysis. It is found that the traffic soliton appears only near the neutral stability line. The soliton solution is analytically obtained from the perturbed KdV equation. It is shown that the soliton solution obtained from the nonlinear analysis is consistent with that of the numerical simulation. [S1063-651X(99)04807-2].

J	Makarewicz, R; Fujimoto, M; Kokowski, P				Makarewicz, R; Fujimoto, M; Kokowski, P			A model of interrupted road traffic noise	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article								Freely flowing road traffic is interrupted by a stopping line. Traffic is mainly from light vehicles, because the number of trucks, buses, etc., is negligible. Vehicles are cruising or stopping, and the traffic flows in both directions is approximately equivalent. The theory discussed in the present study enables us to predict the time-average sound level, L-AT, when the distance between the stopping line and the receiver exceeds the road width, acceleration length, and the length of the vehicle's queue. To estimate the adjustable parameters of the model, two simultaneous measurements of L-AT at the site of interest are required. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. Ail rights reserved.

J	Carter, M; Rakha, H; Van Aerde, M				Carter, M; Rakha, H; Van Aerde, M			Variability of traffic-flow measures across freeway lanes	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic-flow theory; traffic modeling; traffic simulation; incident-detection algorithms		On most freeways, a number of factors interact to produce lane-to-lane variations in speed and volume which are both site and volume dependent. The following paper explores and statistically verifies these variations using detector data and a combination of complementary techniques based on data collected for 30 days at 27 detector stations in May 1994 along the Queen Elizabeth Way freeway near Toronto, Ontario. The analysis indicates that considerable volume dependencies exist at each site, and that these dependencies are site specific. In addition to their independent variations, speed and flow are also shown to interact differently across different lanes and result in different underlying speed-flow relationships. The findings are intended to be relevant to the calibration of microscopic traffic simulation models and automatic incident detection algorithms. As such, the paper does not attempt to specifically identify the underlying causes for the variations, but rather attempts to recognize the aggregated effects of these causes in a fashion that would be useful to real-time freeway traffic management system control strategies relying solely on loop detector inputs.

J	Lam, WHK; Xu, G				Lam, WHK; Xu, G			A traffic flow simulator for network reliability assessment	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							ORIGIN-DESTINATION MATRICES; TRIP MATRICES; COUNTS	This paper investigates the transportation network reliability based on the information provided by detectors installed on some links. A traffic flow simulator (TFS) model is formulated for assessing the network reliability (in terms of travel time reliability), in which the variation of perceived travel time error and the fluctuations of origin-destination (OD) demand are explicitly considered. On the basis of prior OD demand and partial updated detector data, the TFS can estimate the link flows for the whole network together with link/path travel times, and their variance and covariance. The travel time reliability by OD pair can also be assessed and the OD matrix can be updated simultaneously. A Monte Carlo based algorithm is developed to solve the TFS model. The application of the proposed TFS model is illustrated by a numerical example.

J	Webster, N; Elefteriadou, L				Webster, N; Elefteriadou, L			A simulation study of truck passenger car equivalents (PCE) on basic freeway sections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						traffic operations; freeways; simulation; passenger car equivalents		Trucks have an effect on the quality of traffic flow on freeways. The passenger car equivalency of a truck represents the number of passenger cars that would have an equivalent effect on the quality of the traffic flow. This research estimated truck passenger car equivalents using simulation, based on traffic density, It investigates the effect of several characteristics related to freeway design, vehicle performance, and the traffic stream on truck passenger car equivalents. Traffic density is a good indicator of the driver's freedom to maneuver and proximity to other vehicles, and is consistent with the measure of effectiveness for freeways used in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM)[TRB (Transportation Research Board), 1994. Special Report 209. Highway Capacity Manual, Third ed. Transportation Research Board, Washington, DC]. The Freeway Simulation (FRESIM) model, developed by the Federal Highway Administration, was used in this research. FRESIM is a microscopic, stochastic computer simulation model, capable of simulating the operations of traffic on freeways. Based on the output of numerous simulation runs, flow-density curves were developed, and passenger car equivalents were estimated for a wide range of design and traffic conditions, and a range of vehicle performance characteristics. These passenger car equivalents were compared to values provided in the 1994 HCM. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Muramatsu, M; Irie, T; Nagatani, T				Muramatsu, M; Irie, T; Nagatani, T			Jamming transition in pedestrian counter flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						pedestrian flow; traffic flow; phase transition	TRAFFIC-FLOW; SELF-ORGANIZATION; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; MODEL; DYNAMICS; JAMS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION; HIGHWAY; RULES	A lattice gas model with biased random walkers is presented to mimic the pedestrian counter flow in a channel under the open boundary condition of constant density. There are two types of walkers without the back step: the one is the random walker going to the right and the other is the random walker going to the left. It is found that a dynamical jamming transition from the freely moving state at low density to the stopped state at high density occurs at the critical density. The transition point is given by p(c) = 0.45 +/- 0.01, not depending on the system size. The transition point depends on the strength of drift and decreases with increasing drift. Also, we present the extended model to take into account the traffic rule in which a pedestrian walks preferably on the right-hand side of the channel. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Flachsbart, PG				Flachsbart, PG			Models of exposure to carbon monoxide inside a vehicle on a Honolulu highway	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE ANALYSIS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						carbon monoxide; motor vehicle emissions; passenger cabin exposure; statistical models	EMISSIONS; TRENDS	This paper presents statistical models of passenger exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) inside a motor vehicle as it traveled a coastal highway in Honolulu, Hawaii during morning periods between November, 1981 and May, 1982. The 3.85-mile study site was divided into three links. The models predict the average CO concentration inside the vehicle's passenger cabin on the third link as a function of several variables: the average CO concentrations inside the cabin on previous links; traffic, temporal, and meteorological variables; motor vehicle CO emission factors; and ambient CO concentrations. Based on data for 80 trips, the three most powerful models (adjusted R-2=0.69) were nonlinear combinations of four variables: the average CO concentration inside the cabin for the second link; wind speed and direction; and either the travel time, vehicle speed or CO emission factor for the third link. Several nonlinear models were based on data for 62 trips for which nonzero, ambient CO concentrations were available. For this database, the most practical models (adjusted R-2=0.67) combined three variables: the ambient CO concentration; the second-link travel time; and either the travel time, vehicle speed or CO emission factor for the third link. Two factors of third-link CO exposure varied seasonally. Relatively lighter traffic flows and stronger winds lowered cabin exposures during late fall, while heavier traffic flows and calmer winds elevated cabin exposures during winter and spring. This study confirms the importance of seasonal effects on cabin exposure, as observed by a California study and adds new insights about their effects.
