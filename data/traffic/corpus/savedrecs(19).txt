This model can provide different matrices such as throughput, queue length and delay time. This paper will describe how the model works and how composition of traffic mix effects the throughput (numbers of vehicles navigate through the intersection per unit of time (vph)) and also compare the result with homogeneous counterpart.								*AM ASS STAT HIGHW, 2007, AM FREIGHT CHALL VOI; Brilon W., 1997, P 3 INT S INT TRAFF, P61; Deo P, 2006, LECT NOTES COMPUT SC, V4173, P522; Feng Y, 2007, INT J MOD PHYS C, V18, P107, DOI 10.1142/S0129183107010279; KIMBER RM, 1980, 942 TRANSP ROAD RES; Li XB, 2004, INT J MOD PHYS B, V18, P2703, DOI 10.1142/S0217979204025944; NAGEL K, 1992, J PHYS I, V2, P2221; Tian ZZ, 1999, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V33, P187, DOI 10.1016/S0965-8564(98)00044-5; WOLFRAM S, 1986, THEORY APPL CELLULAR, P8	9	0	0	0	0	SPIE-INT SOC OPTICAL ENGINEERING	BELLINGHAM	1000 20TH ST, PO BOX 10, BELLINGHAM, WA 98227-0010 USA	0277-786X		978-0-8194-6973-1	P SOC PHOTO-OPT INS			2008	6802						80210	80210					6	Engineering, Biomedical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Optics	Engineering; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Optics	BHK59	WOS:000253877000021					2021-01-11

In the algorithm, the values of solution variables are mapped onto an intermediate state locally around the cell interface, and then the finite difference WENO reconstruction is applied. The hybrid scheme is consistent with steady flows, and resolves the waves more efficiently than the standard WENO scheme. The algorithm is also applicable to hyperbolic conservation laws with spatially varying fluxes in general. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wong, S.

Various models are developed to understand single-lane traffic, multilane traffic, lane-changing behavior and network traffic situations. In this study, the fundamental diagram, which is the relationship among speed, density and flow, is simulated by CA under multi-class user traffic conditions. Acceleration rule, slow down possibility and maximal speed are main effects, which determine driving behavior. According to the results, neither the mixture of the speed-density nor flow-density relationship of multi-class traffic is the linear combination of users involving in the traffic flow. The performance of the mixture models may not be worse than single-user model. Therefore, understanding multi-class users traffic had better to simulate it directly instead of estimating it by using the combination of each user.

The major difference among the rules is that different gap is designed due to the speed of vehicles. According to the results, CA rules with AVCSS (the H-0, H-1, H-2 and H-3 models) perform stable traffic in the uncongested regime and larger flow and speed in the congested regime. However, the average speeds of the H-1 and H-2 models fluctuate largely, which are considered unsafe and unreliable, in the congested regime. The results of the H-0 and H-3 rules are more stable. Since the H-3 rules keep a larger gap between two successive vehicles, the H-3 rules is considered the best design of the four rules. Therefore, an efficient design of AVCSS might be obtained by CA simulation.

This paper presents a simulation approach for the optimal sequencing of aircrafts on a single runway operating in a mixed mode (arrival and departure) and runway system capacity assessment using State Space Analysis. System dynamics are specified using the Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) formalism. The approach is capable of automating the decision activity (scheduling), analyzing different scenarios of scheduling policies and optimizing the runway capacity at any given time based on actual or dynamic traffic flow. It is aimed at validating not only the expected benefit of capacity and safety but also the benefits on efficiency from the air traffic controller's perspective.

In particular, the case study of the harbour of Salerno, Italy, is presented. Simulations of vehicular flows are carried out by a graphical tool, that allows to reproduce the evolution of densities on the roads of the network through animated and coloured pictures. From the analysis of simulated densities on roads, obtained by a given input configuration for the network object of study, the tool is able to plan some strategies for the improvement of traffic conditions through an optimization routine.

This is better done by modeling the system, which will enable the study of the influencing factors over a wide range. Computer simulation has emerged as an effective technique for modelling traffic flow due to its capability to account for the randomness related to traffic. This paper is concerned with application of a simulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow, named HETEROSIM, to study the relationships between traffic flow variables such as traffic volume and speed. Further, the model is also applied to quantify the vehicular interaction in terms of Passenger Car Equivalent (PCE) or Passenger Car Unit (PCU), taking a stretch of an intercity road in India as the case for the study. The results of the study, provides an insight into the complexity of the vehicular interaction in heterogeneous traffic.	[Arasan, V.

The project deals with the implementation of predictive optimal control algorithms operating the truck at economically favourable operation points by considering the costs of operation (fuel, driver, leasing, maintenance, income) and the dynamics of the vehicle (engine, brakes, fuel consumption, mass etc.). The approach considers GPS positioning and 3D maps for slope, curve and speed limit information of future road segments. It is planned to include radar information (position and speed of preceding vehicle), traffic information (traffic flow and density) and transportation job constraints like fixed arrival times and use of time buffers for optimisation. The goal of the project is to reduce the fuel consumption and driving time under the restriction of overall economic considerations in truck operation. In the following, the current state of the work, some results and outline the future road map is outlined.

Eugene			Gravity model in the Korean highway	EPL			English	Article							SPATIAL STRUCTURE; AIR TRAVEL; WORLD; MIGRATION	We investigate the traffic flows of the Korean highway system, which contains both public and private transportation information. We find that the traffic flow T-ij between city i and j forms a gravity model, the metaphor of physical gravity as described in Newton's law of gravity, PiPj/r(ij)(2), where Pi represents the population of city i and r(ij) the distance between cities i and j. It is also shown that the highway network has a heavy tail even though the road network is a rather uniform and homogeneous one. Compared to the highway network, air and public ground transportation establish inhomogeneous systems and have power law behaviors. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2008.

This goal, in respect of road transport, can be attained by encouraging public transport modes like buses by assigning priority. This paper is concerned with application of micro simulation technique to study the impact of provision of reserved bus lanes on the flow of highly heterogeneous traffic on urban roads. The specific objectives of this paper are (i) to modify and validate a newly developed model of heterogeneous traffic flow using field observed data and (ii) to apply the validated simulation model to study the impact of exclusive bus lanes introduced on urban arterials for a wide range of traffic volume levels. The impact of introduction of an exclusive bus lane is measured in terms of the reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space, over a wide range of traffic volume. The main finding of this paper is, that if an exclusive bus lane is provided under highly heterogeneous traffic conditions,(prevailing in Indian cities), then, the maximum permissible volume to capacity ratio that will ensure a level of service of C for the traffic stream comprising all the motor vehicles, except the buses, is about 0.53.

In Le Havre agglomeration (CODAH), there are 33 establishments classified SEVESO with hi-h threshold. The modeling and assessment of the danger is useful when it intersects with the exposed stakes. The most important factor is people. In the literature., vulnerability maps are constructed to help decision makers assess the risk. These maps are based on several types of vulnerability: socio-demographic, biophysical and other different types of hazards. Nevertheless, such approaches remain static and do not take into account the population displacement in the estimation of the vulnerability. We propose a decision support system which consists in a dynamic vulnerability map based on the difficulty to evacuate different sectors in Le Havre agglomeration. This map is visualized using the Geographic Information System (GIS) of the CODAH and evolves according to the dynamic state of the road traffic through a detection of communities in a large graph.

Because fuzzy logic has a clear advantage that it is able to use expert knowledge well, we adopt it in our controller. As adaptive dynamic programming is an advanced technology which is suitable for solving nonlinear stochastic system optimizing problems, we use it to optimize our fuzzy logic controller. We set up an isolated intersection model of two-way roads with both left and right turns, and test the controller with ADP optimization under both constant and variable traffic flow rates. The simulation results show that this controller has a good performance.

It indicates the slow vehicle dominates traffic jamming. When the mixing ratio f approaches 1, all of vehicles are slow ones and their fundamental diagram shows the saddle shape of flow in the congestion regions. It confirms the flow in the saddle shape takes on the property of synchronization flow by discussion about the cross-correlation function and time-space pattern of traffic.

First, the historical traffic flow data is obtained from the loop detectors installed on the road network of Beijing. Then, part of the data is selected for training the MARS model while the rest is used to test the method. The results based on MARS method are compared with those of other methods such as the Neural Networks. The proposed MARS method is proved to have a considerable accuracy. Moreover, the model constructed with MARS can be described with analytical functions, which helps a lot in the further research on traffic flow forecasting.

Intersections Modeling with a class of "second-order" models for vehicular traffic flow	HYPERBOLIC PROBLEMS: THEORY, NUMERICS, APPLICATIONS: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HYPERBOLIC PROBLEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	11th International Conference on Hyperbolic Problems	JUL 17-21, 2006	Lyon, FRANCE				OPTIMIZATION; NETWORK; WAVES	In a recent paper, Herty and Rascle (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 38:595-616, 2006) introduced some coupling conditions to model road junctions with the Aw-Rascle traffic flow model (Aw and Rascle, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 60:916-944, 2000). In this chapter, we study an extension of the work in Herty and Rascle (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 38:595-616, 2006). Here, in contrast to Herty and Rascle (SIAM J. Appl. Math. 38:595-616, 2006), we propose a general formulation for suitable coupling conditions at an intersection, without imposing any fixed mixture principle. The solution conserves mass and "pseudomornentum" and additionally maximizes the total (mass) flux at an intersection. This problem has been completely solved in the cases of 2 -> 1 (merge) and 1 -> 2 (diverge) junctions. Furthermore these two simple cases of merging and diverging junctions can. be combined to model more complex junctions, like roundabouts.

It takes wavelet function as fuzzy membership function, uses neural networks to realize fuzzy reasoning, and finishes the estimate of next cyclical traffic flow. Simultaneously the genetic algorithm is used to optimize the overall network. After the field data test, this method is high precise, stable and compatible.

Some forecasting models have been developed, but these methods' precision usually can't meet with practical requirement. The Traffic models of different time sections in a day have diversities. The forecasting precision could be improved if the models are built on different time section. A serial clustering method based on extended entropy information bottleneck theory is proposed It is used to partition a day into different time section according to history traffic flow data. Support Vector Machines (SVM) is used to forecast traffic flow. Bayesian inference is used to fix the SVM's kernel parameters to improve the regression precision. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through analyzing the traffic data of Jinan urban transportation.

By using cellular automaton models, our work has taken the non-lane based behaviors of nonmotorized vehicles into account, which has not been considered in previous works. We have investigated flow rates of the system. The traffic state diagram and the spatiotemporal pattern are presented as the inflow rates of motorized vehicles and nonmotorized vehicles change. Traffic interactions between motorized vehicles and nonmotorized vehicles may cause congestions in traffic flow, at dense flow, but has no influence at sparse flow. These results are expected to shed some light on the management and design of urban mixed traffic systems.

Complexity of causes of traffic crashes at highway intersections, difficulty in data collection of traffic accidents and traffic conflicts and many other reasons have made safety performance evaluation of highway intersections one of the most difficult tasks, in spite of the fact that studies on it have been carried out for quite a long time. Popular methods which are based upon traffic accidents and traffic conflicts are proved to be effective in certain circumstances, but difficulty in data collection of traffic crashes and subjective judgment and determination of traffic conflicts constrain their applications. Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China, this paper aims to set up a new approach to safety performance evaluation of highway intersections by application of traffic flow theories. Based on systematic analysis of causes of traffic accidents at highway intersections, the safety performance evaluation models take the form of possibility estimation of serious traffic conflicts. The models are efficient though their mathematical expressions are simple. By analysis of the models, some meaningful conclusions are drawn toward improvement of safety performance of highway intersection.

This paper proposed a fuzzy simulation optimization method for the optimal configuration of checkposts. At the first, a discrete event simulation model based on queuing theory was built through the analysis of logistics operation and traffic flow in FTPA. And a mathematical programming model was established for minimum operation cycle time and feasible utilization of the checkposts. With the fuzzy decision theory, the degree of satisfaction with solutions and importance weight for objectives were adopted to transferring the multiple-objective optimization problem into a process searching for a Bellman-Zadeh optimal solution. Then, the simulation optimization method combined heuristic algorithm was designed to solve this problem. Finally, an actual case study was illustrated to verify the proposed method. The results have shown that the optimal solution can reduce redundancy in checkpost lanes in effect.

By analyzing the traffic characteristics of the link between two signalized intersections, an analysis method for signalized intersection safety spacing is presented, which is based on the traffic stability distance. Accordingly, a safety spacing of signalized intersection could be established based on the traffic stability distance and the up-stream functional area length of intersection. Based on the results of field survey and VISSIM simulation, the CV (coefficient of variance) value is consistent with the traffic conflict distribution on the link, so it could be used as indirect safety evaluation index and also to determine the stability distance of traffic flow, then the stability distance is calculated based on speed dispersion theory; Finally, combining the up-stream functional area length of intersection, the minimum safety spacing criteria of signalized intersections is established for arterial highway.

The system collects and extracts real-time information of in-transit goods by attached active RFID tags. Real-time traffic flow information of observed roads and the vehicle location information are fed back by the driver of cargo. Moreover, traffic flow status of unobserved roads is extracted from historical data as empirical stochastic distributions. Therefore, the optimization of vehicle route is calculated by a simulation-based optimization algorithm. In the algorithm, a computational model is built to represent the complicated vehicle routing problem, instead of traditional mathematical model. In this way, each uncertain traffic flow status of unobserved roads in the problem is simulated by a random variable generator in the computational model. The intelligent algorithm optimizes the vehicle route according to simulation outputs. Additionally, the proposed system is built on multi-agent platform under client/server software architecture. The distributed computing capability of multi-agent technology promises the approach has better operating performances.

This can directly affect the traffic flow and create congestion points which in turn can cause car accidents. However, road density in terms of number of cars may represent an opportunity to facilitate inter-vehicular Communication and optimize packet routing in a Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET). There have been a number of research activities in both road traffic simulation and IIIC, however little have addressed the best trade-off between road density in terms of number of cars and the quality of vehicular communication and consequently their implications on road incidents as well as transmission delays and packet loss. In this paper, we propose to study the relationship between road traffic and vehicular communication in terms of road density, and car speed in one side, and communication delay, and packet loss in the other side. We also propose to describe the design and implementation of the simulator VIE (Vehicular Information Exchange Simulator).

For realization of the aforesaid purpose, it is introduced the concept of "restoration (self-restoration) of the flow" in the given work is introduced, and then, proceeding from this concept and its relevant consequences, the discrete model for a determination of vehicles quantity at any point of examined road site in any time moment is deduced for some known information on vehicles quantity at the initial time moment and for the known vehicles quantity in borders of a road site during the whole proceeded period of traffic flow motion process investigation time. It is proved, that under some additional conditions in the suggested discrete model it is Possible to carry out limiting transitions and to receive the continuous model, conterminous to widely known mass equation but where the sensitivity coefficient, firstly, is regarded to be a function from spatial and time variables, and, second, is not a priori known.

It is very difficult to obtain high quality performance by using traditional control method due to the uncertainty of traffic flow and complexity of elevator control. A dynamic dispatching system for elevator group based on artificial intelligent technology is presented in this paper. This system includes traffic pattern identify module and dispatching control module mainly. Traffic pattern identify module based on ANN expert system is used to identify the traffic mode of elevators according to the actual traffic flow. Dispatching control module founded on ANN control theory is used to calculate dispatching parameter, the power coefficients selected according to the traffic mode, and give optimized dispatching scheme via ANN deducing. The simulation is made in MATLAB. The results show that elevator dispatching pattern is optimized, the service quality of elevator is improved and the transportation efficiency of elevator is increased by using this control system.

A measure model of disorder motion in traffic flow is put forward based on the traffic entropy. The measure model has been applied to analysis the disorder motion in traffic flow. Aim at the traffic flows on the first, second, third and fourth-class road with the design speed 80, 60, 40, 30, and 20 separate v, the thresholds of 9 traffic flows are calculated. Based on the thresholds of the calculated results, the traffic flow is in the disorder motion in traffic flow when the threshold N is 1.10. The speed of traffic flow is less than 30% of the design speed in this time. The model solves in principle the measure problem of the disorder motion in traffic flow and provides the theoretical foundation to study on transition process between disorder motion and order motion.

On the basis of the relevant research works, this paper presents a method assessing the safety level in rural freeways based on accident, traffic flow and facilities characteristics. Three models relating accident data, traffic flow characteristics and facilities characteristics to safety are studied and the criteria to divide safety levels are established by applying statistics method, traffic flow simulation and fizzy set theory. Then the integrated safety status is defined and classified by analyzing the intrinsic relationship among accident data, traffic flow characteristics, facilities characteristics and safety. The integrated safety status can present the priority for safety improvement and also help diagnose safety problems and select treatments.

Constant time to collision platoons	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Computers, Communications and Control	MAY 15-17, 2008	Baile Felix, ROMANIA			knowledge embedding by computer models; constant time to collision; fuzzy-interpolative cruise controllers		The paper is presenting a new method for the management of the traffic flow on highways, based on the constant time to collision criterion. The criterion is applied for each car implied in traffic, and for the whole highway. Each car is provided with a constant time to collision cruise controller, which is maintaining optimal distance-gaps between cars, adapted to the speed and to the technical data of the cars. The traffic management center has the possibility to impose the same time to collision over the entire highway. This way the traffic is organizing itself, by distributing the cars such way that the collision risk is uniformly distributed. Simulations are illustrating how the cars are behaving when they are forming highway platoons and how the traffic flow may be controlled by imposing the time to collision.			balas@inext.ro	Balas, Valentina E./A-2003-2009; Balas, Marius M./A-8146-2010; Balas, Valentina Emilia/F-4525-2010; Balas, Valentina E./H-6288-2019	Balas, Valentina E./0000-0003-0885-1283; Balas, Marius M./0000-0001-9092-4730; Balas, Valentina Emilia/0000-0003-0885-1283; Balas, Valentina E./0000-0003-0885-1283			BALAS M, 2002, REGULATOARE FUZZY IN; BALAS M, 2006, INT S RES ED INN ER, P531; BALAS M, 2006, P IEEE INT C MECH BU, P215; BALAS M, 2006, SEM LSIS ST JER MARS; Balas M.

The proposed algorithm divides a large signalized network into several subgroups with three or more intersections according to real traffic flow. In each subgroup, signal coordination between neighboring intersections is built by a common cycle and offsets. In order to achieve the optimal performance index, genetic algorithm is developed to synchronously optimize signal timing parameters. A case study was presented to illustrate how the proposed approach could be applied. The result was compared with that from TRANSYT-7F. It indicated that the proposed approach improved efficiency and reduced the vehicles' delay time for urban area traffic.

Much attention was focused on the nonlinear time series technique to analyze the traffic data collected from detectors or from traffic flow models. For real highway systems, it usually consists of two or more lanes. Vehicles on different lanes affect each other, especially for a traffic jam. The purpose of this paper is to analyze nonlinear dynamical behaviours of traffic on different lanes based on 1-minute-interval. Typical time series is checked, traffic characteristics on different lanes are analyzed. It is found that both chaos characteristics and stochastic phenomena appear in the traffic flow.

Heterogeneous traffic flow modelling for an arterial using grid based approach	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						traffic flow modelling; simulation; heterogeneous traffic flow; cellular automata; microscopic traffic flow model	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; WAVES	A grid based modelling approach akin to cellular automata (CA) is adopted for heterogeneous traffic flow simulation. The road space is divided into a grid of equally sized cells. Moreover, each vehicle type occupies one or more cell as per its size unlike CA traffic flow model where each vehicle is represented by a single cell. Model needs inputs such as vehicle size, its maximum speed, acceleration, deceleration, probability constants, and arrival pattern. The position and speed of the vehicles are assumed to be discrete. The speed of each vehicle changes according to its interactions with other vehicles, following some stochastic rules depending on the circumstances. The model is calibrated and validated using real data and VISSIM. The results indicate that grid based model can reasonably well simulate complex heterogeneous traffic as well as offers higher computational efficiency needed for real time application.

Agent-based modelling and simulation of urban evacuation: relative effectiveness of simultaneous and staged evacuation strategies	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						agent-based modelling; simulation; evacuation; network; transportation	BEHAVIOR; FLOW	This study investigates the effectiveness of simultaneous and staged evacuation strategies using agent-based simulation. In the simultaneous strategy, all residents are informed to evacuate simultaneously, whereas in the staged evacuation strategy, residents in different zones are organized to evacuate in an order based on different sequences of the zones within the affected area. This study uses an agent-based technique to model traffic flows at the level of individual vehicles and investigates the collective behaviours of evacuating vehicles. We conducted simulations using a microscopic simulation system called Paramics on three types of road network structures under different population densities. The three types of road network structures include a grid road structure, a ring road structure, and a real road structure from the City of San Marcos, Texas. Default rules in Paramics were used for trip generation, destination choice, and route choice. Simulation results indicate that (1) there is no evacuation strategy that can be considered as the best strategy across different road network structures, and the performance of the strategies depends on both road network structure and population density; (2) if the population density in the affected area is high and the underlying road network structure is a grid structure, then a staged evacuation strategy that alternates non-adjacent zones in the affected area is effective in reducing the overall evacuation time.

The criterion is applied at two levels, for each car implied in traffic, and for the whole highway. Each car is provided with a constant time to collision cruise controller, that is maintaining optimal distance-gaps between cars, in accordance to the technical data of each car, the actual speed, and an imposed time to collision. The highway's traffic management center has the possibility to impose the same optimal time to collision to all the cars in the traffic. This way the traffic is permanently organizing itself, by distributing the cars such way that the collision risk is uniformly distributed. The traffic intensity is controlled by the imposed time to collision.			balas@inext.ro	Balas, Valentina E./A-2003-2009; Balas, Marius M./A-8146-2010; Balas, Valentina Emilia/F-4525-2010	Balas, Valentina E./0000-0003-0885-1283; Balas, Marius M./0000-0001-9092-4730; Balas, Valentina Emilia/0000-0003-0885-1283			BALAS M, 2006, SEMINAIRE LSIS STJER; BALAS M, 2006, P IEEE INT C MECH BU, P215; Balas M.

Neural networks application helps to solved difficult problems that the human brain or other computational techniques can not. Neural networks are being widely used to real world problems; one of them is transportation systems. Nowadays the biggest problem for many cities is a poorly organized traffic management system, traffic flows rapidly increase in last years and cities are often not ready for this. ANN application can give a possibility to improve, optimise the transportation system. ANN's have already been different prediction, forecasting, classification, detection and estimation tasks. In the paper, successfully applied for different the neural networks based approaches (Multilayer, The Kohonen maps, Radial Basis function) for solving different , travel time and passenger demand forecasting, sign and moving transportation planning problems such as traffic object on the road recognition, incident detection are described.

J	Zorlu, F				Zorlu, Fikret			The role of urban patterns in the performance of circulation systems	METU JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ARCHITECTURE			Turkish	Article						circulation system; road network; urban pattern; topology; network design	TRAFFIC CIRCULATION; NETWORK DESIGN; SPATIAL-ASPECTS; INFORMATION; LINKS	Circulation network design, widely mentioned as road network design, is one of the main topics in urban planning, urban transportation planning, traffic engineering and urban design. In the literature on road network design, problems and principles are examined through quantitative and qualitative researches (Magnanti and Wong, 1984; Hillier, 1987; Ran and Boyce, 1996; Hillier, 1999; Southworth and Ben-Joseph, 2003; Drezner and Wesolowsky, 2003, Marshall, 2005). The former one implies analysis and simulation of demographic and economic variables in order to apply appropriate circulation schemes, while the latter one deals with various factors of design and aims to create urban spaces regarding 'space quality'. This paper examines the role of urban patterns in the formation of road networks; thereby depicting relative performance and handicaps of road networks under stated travel distribution among specified units. Road network design requires knowledge of circulation concepts and methodology of assessment. This study provides a topological analysis method and assessment criteria in order to understand performances of various types of road networks. In order to constitute road networks, circulation systems are adapted on three basic types of urban pattern: the grid, the hexagon and the radio-centric. Finally, two certain travel demand matrices are assigned to the specified road networks in order to assess relative advantages of various patterns and circulation networks. At the first stage, travel distribution among units (zones) is assumed to be uniform while second stage is performed with a matrix representing a centre-oriented travel distribution pattern. Here, circulation systems connote to the conceptual representation of movement of vehicles on specific routes, while circulation network (road network) is the concrete form of any specificied circulation system. There are numerous studies on advanced traffic management systems, which mainly focus on the issue of uninterrupted traffic flow (Ran and Boyce, 1996; Levinson, 2003). In the last decade, intelligent transportation systems and traveler route guidance stystems are extensively adapted to urban transportation systems. On the other hand, there are limited studies measuring the the performances of such systems, which are highly dependent to the characteristics of road network (Emmerink et al., 2003; Levinson, 2003). Marshall (2005) argues that street pattern is significantly influenced by the "geometry of movement" and "the topology of route connectivity". Geometry of movement is the representation of individuals' travel patterns while connectivity refers to the structural (topological) characteristics of road network; such as hierarchy and composition of links (road sections) and nodes (junctions). This study deals with the role of urban patterns on the formation of road networks and relative performances of circulation systems. Conceptual forms of circulation systems, described by Wright et al.(1989) are adapted to basic types of urban patterns (the grid, the hexagonal and the radiocentric) in order to obtain road networks. Those networks are compared in terms of network efficiency, measured by average travel distance, traffic volume/capacity ratio, standard deviation among travel volumes, and average travel time. Proposed measures are applied to 33 test networks, which are derived from three base patterns: the grid, the hexagon, and the radio-centric. Traffic assignment procedure is carried out in order to observe performances of road networks. Results showed that when uniform travel distribution is considered, connected networks, such as convex polygons and concentric corridors, perform better than less connected circulation networks. Those networks perform with uniform volume capacity ratios; therefore, hierarchial capacity design is not necessary for such systems. Convex systems have high efficiency when adapted to grid patterns rather than hexagonal and radio-centric. Average traffic volumes and standard deviation on convex networks are much less than semi-connected or tree networks. Hence, connected road networks perform with less average travel distance and average travel time. Results showed that grid patterns are more advantageous when convex circulation systems are adapted, while hexagonal patterns perform better when tree or star shaped systems are adapted. Compared to two-way systems, one-way circulation systems prove to be inefficient in terms of travel distance and time, however, conflicts at intersections are much less. When centre-oriented trips are assigned to road networks, star-shaped and tree-shaped networks perform better, however, total travel time and total travel distance is more than others. Those networks perform with moderate volume capacity ratios.

This approach is suitable for distributed parameter systems in order to reformulate their partial differential equation description as sets of transfer functions. The model used in our work is the macroscopic continuous Lighthill-Whitham-Richards representation. The physical phenomena characteristic for the vehicular flow on a highway section are analyzed over some important length. This implies the description of the traffic as a distributed parameter plant. We present the Green function transformation's general case and after we apply it to the considered traffic flow model in order to obtain its transfer function form. The sets of expressions obtained can be specified using concrete fundamental diagrams and data, and also can be implemented in the design of control strategies.

To identify traffic state effectively is a foundational work for improving traffic condition and preventing traffic congestion. In this paper, an index system of traffic state was established, it through analysis of the multi-source and heterogeneous data from the traffic network, and for the demand of complex structure of large-scale road networks. The proposed index system includes micro-layer, which describes flow tendency on links or nodes, and meso-layer, which represents link-to-link or given region flow condition and diversification, and macro-layer, which indicates more large-scale than meso-layer region flow status and variety. A new method of estimating level of service (LOS) of link, node and network is developed to identify traffic state. A numerical example is studied in Stabilized-door bridge to Bell-tower bridge urban traffic. The proposed index system is employed in evaluating traffic level of service to get traffic flow condition and variety. The evaluation results show that level of service can truly reflect the traffic state. Accordingly, the truly traffic status testified the effective for the proposed evaluation method in traffic level of service.

While, region traffic situation modeling are becoming crucial problem for urban traffic management and traffic flow control. A novel dynamic region traffic model is proposed in this paper. The region traffic mathematical model is classified as macroscopic model, mesoscopic model and microscopic model. Macroscopic model represents region traffic state, which is appropriate for large area analysis. Mesoscopic model is capable for the corresponding transportation network problem. Microscopic model is suit for vehicle cluster behavior. Considering probability and trends, the information fusion techniques are used to process historical data. The dynamic region traffic model can be fit for the long term and short term traffic situation estimate.

J	Belinova, Z				Belinova, Zuzana			Self-organizing aspects in transportation and their modelling	NEURAL NETWORK WORLD			English	Article						self-organization; traffic control; human behaviour		Traffic control is significantly contributing to lower the implications of ever increasing amount of traffic in almost all countries and thus lower the impacts of increasing number of vehicles in traffic. One of the means how to improve the traffic control is to take into the account more significantly the impact of individual human behaviour. Drivers interact with each other and this leads to the emergence of self-organization processes. Description of self-organization is important for more exact modelling of vehicles movement. To achieve this it is possible to introduce human related parameters into the traffic models. The aim of this paper is to summarize the main human depending parameters influencing the traffic flow and consider the possibility of including them into the traffic control modelling on macroscopic level.

A Road Traffic Model with Overtaking: Continuation of the Oscillatory Patterns	NUMERICAL MATHEMATICS AND ADVANCED APPLICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	7th European Conference on Numerical Mathematics and Advanced Applications (ENUMATH 2007)	SEP 10-14, 2007	Graz, AUSTRIA	Austrian Minist Sci & Res, State Styria, Assoc Appl Math & Mech, Graz Univ Technol, Karl Franzens Univ Graz			DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW	We investigate microscopic models of the road traffic. In particular, we consider car following models for a single-line traffic flow on a circular road. The classical differentiable models break down at the time instant when two cars collide. Nevertheless, the natural action of a driver would be to overtake the slower car. In our previous work, we proposed a model which simulates an overtaking. The model implicitly defines a maneuver consisting of deceleration/acceleration just shortly before/after the overtaking. We observed a large variety of oscillatory solutions (oscillatory patterns) of the model. In case N = 3 (three cars on the route), we can supply a finite classification list of these patterns. In the present contribution, we stick to N = 3, and formulate our model as a particular Filippov system i.e., ODE with discontinuous righthand sides. We define oscillatory patterns as invariant objects of this Filippov system. We use the standard software (AUTO97) to continue these patterns with respect to a parameter.

First, the freeway traffic flow model is built, and the objective of ramp metering is determined. In conjunction with the advantages of fuzzy logic in processing language information and PI control in processing error, a fuzzy-PI mix controller is then designed, and genetic algorithm is used to optimize the PI parameters. Density tracking error and error variation are chosen as the input variables of fuzzy logic control, and triangle curves are used for the membership functions of the fuzzy variables. Nine fuzzy control rules are established, and genetic optimization procedures are designed to tune the PI parameters. Finally, the mix controller is simulated. The results show that the mix controller has better dynamic and steady-state performance compared with conventional PID control, and can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway. This approach is quite effective to the on-ramp control.

Variable speed control can stabilize and smooth traffic flow and improve traffic safety. Ramp metering can improve freeway flow and traffic safety by adjusting the metering rate. After the interaction between variable speed control and ramp metering is analyzed, we formulate variable speed control and ramp metering as a Stackelberg game with a leader and multi-follower. Variable speed control is regarded as the leader and on-ramps as the followers. Within this framework, we propose a Stackelberg game model of variable speed control and ramp metering. At last, we use a simple network to illustrate our approach and the simulation results show that this approach is effective.

Since traffic flow has the property of periodicity and randomicity, a dynamic recursion network, which called Elman neutral network model, is presented. Compared with other static neural network model, the model has the ability to adapt the time-varying and can approximate the dynamic system more dramatically and directly. Dissimilation Particle Swarm Optimization (DPSO) algorithm is used to determine the parameters of the model respectively while it has solved the defects such as prematurity of traditional PSO. In particular, our experiments show that the method can both enhance training speed and mapping accurate than other algorithms. The simulation results of traffic flow collected from Chinese national urban road show that the model has greater efficiency and better performance.

In this paper, we use hybrid Petri nets (HPNs) to specify traffic and traffic control at an intersection and use a second-order macroscopic model to model the motion of vehicles in a road stretch between two successive intersections. The traffic control system of an arterial street is thus modeled as a composition of individual intersection models and road stretch models. Such a structure is suitable to perform traffic optimization by changing (he length of the offset between two adjacent intersections with the common cycle.

The randomization parameter is calculated according to fuzzy illation rules on the basis of Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model. As the main information that a driver can get during velocity updating process, spatial gap and velocity of corresponding vehicle act as the inputs of the fuzzy illation framework. As a result, the randomization parameter is outputted via the inference mechanism of the fuzzy illation framework. Through numerical simulations, it is found that the new model is able to reproduce one of the most interesting traffic phenomena called synchronized flow in Kerner's three-phase traffic theory, which can not be reproduced by the NS model.

So in this paper, based on Shanghai Outlines Cross-River Tunnel (SOCRT) project, a Data Mining based Traffic Direction Control Algorithm (DMTDCA) is proposed to adjust the traffic direction of Direction-Changeable Lanes (DCLs) in the tunnel automatically and timely according to analysis results of current traffic flow and short-term forecasted traffic flow of two tunnel entrances in order to make full use of all lanes. Field tests and user reports show efficiency of DMTDCA by 30% increase of average traffic capability, 10% increase of rush hour traffic capability and 40% decrease of average queue length.

In this paper, GPS-based vehicle locator data from a fleet of 40-60 roving ambulances are used to estimate traffic congestion along a network of 20,000 streets in the city of Ottawa, Canada. Essentially, the road network is represented as a directed graph and a belief propagation algorithm is used to interpolate measurements from the fleet. The system incorporates a number of navel features. It makes no distinctions between freeways and surface streets, incorporates both historical and five sensor data, handles user inputs such as road closures dad manual speed overrides, and is computationally efficient - providing updates every 5 to 6 minutes on commodity hardware. Experimental results are presented which address the key issue of validating the performance and reliability of the system.

Time lags between current traffic flow and upstream traffic flow were estimated in order to make better use of spatial-temporal correlation between the upstream and the downstream. The time lags could help identify the upstream flow series most similar to that of the current road and to be used as the model input. A global SVR model with a time lag was constructed and we found it performed not so well during some time intervals where the traffic flow was dramatically fluctuant. Local SVR models with time lags were constructed especially for those intervals and improved the performance. Combining both of the global and the local models, the multiple model was applied to 5-minute freeway data observed by loop detectors in the project Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMs) of California. Comparisons with several other methods showed that the multiple SVR model with time lags was a promising and effective approach for traffic flow prediction.

These similarities not always appear at spatial adjacent road links because of complexity of road network. In this paper, we adopt Cross-Correlation Function to depict similarities between different traffic flow series according to the observed flow data. The process characteristic generalizes the evolvement rules of traffic flow which are essentials need to be tackled by a prediction model. After choosing the most correlative road links and their time delay instead of the upstream or downstream ones, a Hybrid Process Neural Network is constructed to predict short term traffic flow, which uses various scales to catch traffic features such as daily-periodicity, weeldy-periodicity and spatio. temporal process, since a simple model is not good enough to depict all these rules. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated, and the experimental results show that our method outperforms other compared methods.

The complex conflicts among, traffic streams at an urban intersection, including zero conflict, merging conflict, diverging conflict and crossing conflict, have not been synthetically modeled by existing models. In this paper, we consider a four-leg urban intersection as a grid of 2x2 links (2x2 grid) and present a mufti-commodity kinematic wave (MCKW) traffic flow model, in which all four conflicts are modeled. In this model, we use a fair merging rule and both strictly First-In-First-Out (FIFO) and non-strictly FIFO diverging rules. Moreover the model is used to simulate conflicts at a signalized urban intersection, where there are no crossing conflicts. As a result, the recurrence of gridlock occurred at un-signalized case is prevented.

These tasks are normally carried out by algorithms of traffic state estimation (SE) combined with automatic incident detection (AID) on the basis of local measurements (e.g. inductive loop data, radar data, etc.). It is evident that faults and inaccuracies in the process of measuring traffic data affect the quality of SE and AID significantly. Especially faults in measuring the traffic volume occur frequently. They cause false alarms or they hinder these systems to detect dangerous incidents. In this article we apply methods of technical fault diagnosis to design an AID. Therein, a vector-based innovation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used for distinguishing traffic incidents from flawed data and from other disturbances on traffic flow. Also it is used for timely detection of traffic incidents. For reasons of a robust application in real-world scenarios with flawed data, some modifications are discussed and their positive effects on the innovation-based approach are presented.

EVAQ: A New Analytical Model for Voluntary and Mandatory Evacuation Strategies on Time-varying Networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat				The analytical evacuation network model EVAQ enables forecasting traffic flow conditions on a road network for a wide range of emergency situations, such as hurricanes, bushfires and floods. The proposed model is innovative as it combines voluntary evacuation, with possible pre-trip and en-route decisions, and mandatory evacuation, with prescribed destinations, routes and departure times, within a single generic model framework. Furthermore, we introduce dynamic road infrastructure, in which characteristics such as speed limits, capacity and flow direction can be time-varying due to the hazard's progress in space and time and prevailing traffic regulations and control measures. The evacuation model can function as a decision support system for regional authorities and emergency services supervising an evacuation or constructing an evacuation strategy for planning purposes.

Recently, many researchers begin to show interests in microscopic simulation based interpretations on the formulation of gap ant headway distributions. However, there are few Cellular Automata (CA) model proposed in this area, since most current CA models focus on phase transitions of freeway traffic only. In this paper, a so called Markov-Gap CA models is proposed, aiming on fitting the empirical gap/headway distributions collected. The model treats gap variations between consecutive vehicles approaching or leaving signalized intersections as different Markov processes and provides a concise and uniform method to describe the observed traffic flow phenomena. The agreement between the simulation results and empirical data suggests the soundness of the Markov-Gap CA model.

Different from the previous link or movement based traffic flow models, the proposed model considers explicitly queue accumulation anti dissipation at the lane-group level, in order to facilitate modeling the discharging process for shared lanes. In particular, the proposed model also accounts for the blocking effects between different lane groups due to intersection geometric constraints or improper signal settings which offer potentials for it to be integrated with optimal control models. The performance of the proposed model applied to a real-world intersection under different demand levels appears to be computer-efficient and convincing when validated by a calibrated microscopic simulation program, VISSIM.

In order to predict normative as well as predictive information, a simulation-based DTA model is employed within each stage. Empirical data for freeways, including flows from Call stations and vehicle detectors, are used to validate the model in a real-time environment.

By analyzing the mathematical models of traffic flow transition, the dynamical behaviors can he characterized within the phase plane. Furthermore, 2-D Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) is used to classify the dynamic traffic flow, anti five types of traffic flow patterns are identified based on a real traffic dataset from Taiwan highway systems. Each traffic flow pattern can indicate a different interpretation of a special dynamical traffic behavior.

SPECIALIST: A dynamic speed limit control algorithm based on shock wave theory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Proceedings Paper	11th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSC 2008)	OCT 12-15, 2008	Beijing, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Intelligent Transportat Syst Soc, Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Automat			TRAFFIC FLOW	In literature there are several approaches to eliminate shock waves on freeways by means of dynamic speed limits. Most of them incorporate control systems that have: a high computational complexity or that contain parameters without direct physical interpretation, which may make the application in real life difficult. Here we present an approach called SPECIALIST that is based on shock wave theory, and that has parameters with clear physical meaning. The clear interpretation of the parameters leads to an intuitive anti insightful formulation of the tuning guidelines. One of the most important features related to the parameter tuning is that the stability of the traffic How cap be ensured by selecting a proper maximum density that is allowed to occur in the speed-controlled area. In addition, other parameters can be tuned for more robust behavior or the algorithm. We first present the theory of shock Nave resolution, and next we develop a practical control algorithm based on this theory. A unique feature of the algorithm is that it first judges the solvability of a shock wave and only starts controlling the speed limits if the shock wave is classified as solvable. The algorithm is demonstrated with a simulation example, and it is shown that its performance is similar to existing approaches.	[Hegyi, A.; Hoogendoorn, S.

The same approach was applied in the case of traffic control to single section with on-ramp without combination with variable speed limits [1]. The basic idea is that speed limits can increase the (density) range in which ramp metering is useful [7], [9], [8]. We use LWR traffic How model with the functions of supply and demand between the segments to take into account the hack propagation of the traffic jams [11]. The purpose of the control task is to maximize the How and minimizing the queue length at the on-ramp. We illustrate the flatness approach by comparing the cases 'ramp metering only' and 'coordinated ramp metering and speed limits' for a simple network.

Based on empirical investigation on field data of Beijing urban freeway, schematic phase diagram at on-ramp vicinity is developed and detailed phase transition processes are investigated. There are five phases in the phase diagram of on-ramp vicinity in connection with on-ramp flow and upstream flow, among which are two phases only observed in urban freeway traffic. It's also found that the empirical phase diagram developed in this paper is different from previous theoretical phase diagram of highway traffic. The boundaries of each phase are influenced by traffic demand at locations, such that empirical phase diagrams are vary in quantities at different locations. Moreover, according to investigation on empirical phase transition process, coherent moving flow, as a new phase observed in urban freeway flow in our previous work, is confirmed.

Some approaches have been proposed and developed for this specific purpose. However, these methods either require onerous measurements and prior knowledge, or large amounts of statistics and a long learning duration which cause great difficulties on the practical application of the device. Motivated by this, we propose a novel practical lane boundary estimation algorithm. The proposed method is on the basis of normalized power accumulation. In this method, an adaptive threshold is set to detect the vehicles in the detection region of the traffic radar as well as a vehicle filter to select the vehicle having the strongest echo power. Then the power distribution of the selected vehicle is normalized and put into the power accumulation procedure. Finally, traffic lane boundaries are identified on the basis of the distribution of the normalized power accumulation. Some of the previous approaches are also analyzed in this paper. To test the performance of the proposed algorithm, a great deal of field tests in different locations is conducted and the test results as well as the comparisons with the previous work are presented.

In conventional studies, the advanced methods of traffic signal control usually require the installation of detectors on all link:; in the network. As proposed method has an interpolation function, it can be applied to a wide-area road network that: includes links, tin which traffic meters have been not installed. The experimental results using actual traffic data and an actual road map showed that this method is effective at making traffic flow more smoothly.

Thus traffic speeds and headways inhomogeneity appear in the freeway system, which decrease the total system's efficiency. It is expected that the congestion could be reduced and traffic flow rate could be increased, if the speed and density of the vehicles along a lane can be properly controlled by a controller. In this paper we propose a density controller under the assumption that all vehicles' drives instantly follow the information issued by the controller. Then we control and manage the traffic through the following method: on the macroscopic level, a density controller calculates the desired speed commands to be followed by vehicles in each section of the freeway lanes in order to achieve desired traffic density distributions that lead to optimum traffic flow conditions; on the microscopic level, each vehicle is driven according to the appropriate commands sent by the density controller. And the same time we investigate the benefits of controlling the density and speed of the vehicles along a lane by using the proposed density controller. The simulation results guarantee exponential convergence of the traffic density at each section to the desired density and demonstrate significant benefits in terms of smooth and stable traffic flow that reduce congestion considerably.

First, the freeway traffic flow dynamic model is built. Then the algorithm of the composition controller of CMAC and PID is formulated. In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, the on-ramp metering rate of a freeway is determined by using the composition controller. Finally, the control system is simulated in MATLAB software and fuzzy logic controller is also chosen in contrast to the composition controller. The result shows that the composition controller improves evidently on the aspects of response speed and dynamic performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway, and can make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely. This method provides a novel and practical way to realize freeway on-ramp metering.

The Plug-in HEV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of HEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEV, i.e. the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the destination of the trip. In the past, the trip information has been considered as future information for vehicle operation and thus unavailable a priori. This situation can be changed by the current advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on the use of on-board GPS, GIS and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach of optimal power management of PHEV in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information for the highway portion and the traffic lights signals information for the local road portion. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the final time of the cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid SUV. Only fuel consumption is considered for the cur-rent stage of study. For the local road part, a trip modeling scheme was developed based on the synchronization with the traffic signals. Simulation study was conducted for several standard driving cycles, and their for air example trip. The results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with a rule-based control and a depletion-sustenance control for most cases. The benefit of using traffic signal in trip modeling was also revealed from the improved fuel economy.

Original prediction models in actual appliance don't consider influencing factors comprehensively when dealing with complex and changeable traffic state. Based on the observation of daily similarity of expressway traffic flow series, the paper recognizes weather and date attribute as classification vectors and designs a new time series clustering algorithm through calculating representatives in all kinds of clusters and building correlative relations between observing time series and representatives. In the end traffic flow under different time scales on both weekday and weekend are forecasted. The experiment result shows that the time series clustering algorithm and forecast model make good use of historical data and the accuracy is quite satisfied under 30-minute time scale with the Mean Absolute-Relative-Error 3.34 percent.

Pedestrians are allowed to move with different velocity in our model. Using numerical simulations of the proposed model, we firstly studied in the influence of the preferred time-headway, and found when driven carefully, i.e., with a large preferred time-headway, the vehicle will be affected by even a few pedestrians on the road. While driven aggressively, interesting spatiotemporal features as observed during our daily life were reproduced, such as the oscillation behavior, i.e., a bi-stable state in which the vehicle alternating its velocity between free flowing and congested state, and a congested state of the traffic where the vehicle can only move slowly no matter how fast it wants to drive.

J	Tollazzi, T; Sraml, M; Lerher, T				Tollazzi, Tomaz; Sraml, Matjaz; Lerher, Tone			ROUNDABOUT ARM CAPACITY DETERMINED BY MICROSIMULATION AND DISCRETE FUNCTIONS TECHNIQUE	PROMET-TRAFFIC & TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						roundabouts; traffic flow analysis; micro-simulation modelling; capacity analysis		The paper demonstrates the influence of the multi-channel pedestrian flow on the actual capacity of a one-lane roundabout, using micro-simulation and discrete functions. The proposed model is based on the theory of the expected time gap between the units of pedestrian traffic flow, which have the priority when crossing the arm of the roundabout. The proposed model represents an upgrade of the previous research in the field of modelling traffic flows in the one-lane roundabout. Apart from the multi-channel pedestrian flow the disturbances caused by the circular traffic flow of motorised vehicles at the roundabout are also considered. In this way the model can better illustrate the real conditions in traffic. A simulation analysis has been performed on the roundabout arm at Koroska Street in Maribor. The results of the analysis have indicated a relatively high reserve of the actual throughput capacity for the main motorized traffic flow in the analysed roundabout arm. The presented model represents a practicable and adaptable tool for planning the roundabout capacity in practice and for the sensitivity analysis of individual variables on the throughput capacity of the roundabout.

This algorithm is composed of two parts: computation of solutions to conservation equations on each road and localization of car position resulting by interactions with waves produced on roads. Some applications and examples to describe the behavior of a driver traveling in a road network are shown. Moreover, a convergence result for wave front tracking approximate solutions, with BV initial data on a single road, is established.

Based on the macroscopic method of mathematical analysis and the microscopic cellular automata model, a mixed traffic evacuation model was constructed here, which consists of three modules: transportation network module, discrete dynamical macro-analysis module, and micro-mixed flow evacuation simulation module. This model will be useful for the evaluation of evacuation strategy and be helpful to prepare reasonable evacuation plan.

The most traditional approach of simply adding more physical capacity is not always a realistic solution due to financial, environmental, social, political, physical roadway space or other constraints. However, enhancing the efficiency of the existing system can still make improvements to a certain degree depending on how efficient the existing system is. Often roadway congestion is not caused by the roadway segment where congestion is actually experienced, rather it is caused by bottlenecks downstream of that segment. In such situations, widening congested roadway segment serves only the purpose of storing more vehicles. Traffic operational improvements at the locations where the bottleneck exists may help reducing congestion by enhancing flow of traffic. This paper presents a case study (simulation model) that shows how freeway to freeway HOT lane connection through direct flyover ramps bring about more benefits compared to widening segments of a congested roadway by adding more than 25 lane miles. This simulation case study indicated that the widening option would reduce travel time by 15% whereas flyover ramps would provide 30% reduction in travel time along 15-mile segment of the corridor. The widening and flyover options increase throughput by 7% and 16%, respectively. This paper documents simulation model parameters, assumptions, and findings.

By applying the calculous, the average equivalent queue length change rate models are deduced for single-lane and multi-lane links respectively. It is found that the change rate of equivalent queue length is relative to the traffic wave speed and they are identical at the special circumstance. Finally, the equivalent queue length change rate models are validated by using the simulation data from VISSIM. The results show that the equivalent and actual queue length change rates approach during the sampling interval and they more approach when the sampling interval is longer. When the traffic flow is in the congested state, the evolution speed of vehicular queue can be described quantitatively and simply by the equivalent queue length change rate model. The model provides the theoretical basis for adjusting the strategy of urban traffic control.

The Cell Transmission Model (CTM) is one of the most widely used dynamic link models for simulating dynamic traffic network. Its popularity is due to its simple formulation and low computation requirement. In this paper we develop a stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) to model the evolution of traffic flows on freeways taking into account various uncertainties. We model the transportation network as stochastic system with various supply uncertainties (random variables). The SCTM is formulated by using analytical probability theory and is formulated into a discrete time bilinear stochastic system. A set of probablistic switching conditions is proposed to evaluate the joint traffic density.

The traveler behavior model is the key point on research of traffic flow in ATIS. There are three kinds of ATIS market: the complete ATIS market, incomplete ATIS market and non-ATIS market. In different ATIS markets, we consider different two classes of drivers. A two-user Travelers Game Model was build and the equilibrium of such model was discussed. The solution of Bayesian equilibrium was studied in the incomplete ATIS market and non-ATIS market. In the complete ATIS market, Nash equilibrium is analyzed. In this paper, a two-user traveler game model was proposed under ATIS in a three-route road network. This paper compared expectation of total travel time under different ATIS market penetration. Then we found that more market penetration of ATIS didn't mean less total travel time, and whole expectation of travel time in network firstly went up and then went down while market penetration of ATIS was increasing. In the end, this paper presented several emerging research in the issue of travel game.

With the definition and basic hypothesis of access spacing, the characteristics of its structure and traffic flow are analyzed. From a systematic viewpoint, Kinematics, gap-acceptance theory, and probability theory are employed to establish the minimum-length-requirement model for access spacing. While modeling, the more difficult traffic maneuver of running off the ramp, finishing its interweaving and running onto the left-turn lane of a downstream intersection is taken into consideration. For an existing road, based on the comparison of the measured value and calculated value, the model is helpful for finding the reasons of congestion in the access space and taking corresponding improvement measures. Finally, the model is verified to be feasible through comparison with the simulation results of CORSIM.

The objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical model of work zone traffic flow elements by analyzing the relationships between speed, flow, and density that can be used to estimate the capacity of work zones. Traffic flow data were collected from 22 work zone sites on South Carolina interstate highways. The scatter plots of the collected data demonstrate that the relationship between speed and density does not follow Greenshields' linear model. A non-linear hyperbolic model was developed to describe the relationship between speed and density. Using this model the capacity of a work zone was estimated to be 1550 passenger cars per hour for 2-lane to 1-lane closures. Adjustments to this capacity value to consider other types of vehicle as well as the work zone intensity are provided. Highway agencies can use this estimated capacity along with anticipated traffic demand to schedule work zone operations to avoid long periods of over-saturation. The tapered approach to work zone lane closures used by South Carolina is similar to methods used in work zones throughout the world. The authors believe that the methodology described in this paper for modeling work zone traffic as well as estimating work zone capacity is transferable to other countries. The conversion of actual volumes to passenger car equivalents may have to be modified due to the significant differences in traffic makeup between the United States and other countries.

The time series of the relation has not been identified clearly, even though the time series of the relation reflects the upstream/downstream traffic conditions and should be considered in the traffic flow modeling. In this paper, the dynamic flow-density relation is identified based on the classification of traffic states and is quantified employing fuzzy logic. The quantified dynamic flow-density relation builds the basis for online application of a macroscopic traffic flow model. The new approach to online modeling of traffic flow applying the dynamic flow-density relation alleviates parameter calibration problems stemming from the static flow-density relation.

Road Capacity and Performance Implications of Ramp Closure Toronto, Canada, Experience	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								To alleviate traffic congestion and safety concerns on the Gardiner Expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the City of Toronto has elected to implement scheduled closures for the two on-ramps since early 1970s. This study investigates the traffic impacts of the daily on-ramp closures at Gardiner Expressway and Jameson Avenue. The average changes to traffic flow variables such as traffic volume throughput due to the ramp closures are computed quantitatively. Results show that ramp closure has resulted in smoother traffic flow and higher travel speed but not higher traffic throughput on the expressway. Ramp reopening causes a spike in speed variations as measured by upstream detectors. The network performance metrics (vehicle hours traveled, vehicle kilometers traveled, delay, and travel time) are computed and analyzed to determine the performance benefits of the ramp closures. The travel time saving in the area due to the ramp closure is estimated to be 225 vehicle-hours per day.

Real-Time Vehicle Classification Using Inductive Loop Signature Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Vehicle class is an important characteristic of traffic measurement, and classification information can contribute to many important applications in various transportation fields. For instance, vehicle classification is helpful in monitoring heavy vehicle traffic for road maintenance and safety, modeling traffic flow, and obtaining performance measurements based on each vehicle class for traffic surveillance. A real-time vehicle classification model was introduced. A heuristic method combined with decision tree and K-means clustering approaches was proposed to develop the vehicle classification model. The features used in the proposed model were extracted from piecewise slope rate values, which were obtained from single-loop inductive signature data. Three vehicle classification schemes-FHWA, FHWA-I, and Real-time Traffic Performance Measurement System-and a data set obtained from square single-loop detectors were used for model development. A data set obtained from round single-loop detectors was applied to test the transferability of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that the proposed real-time vehicle classification model is not only capable of categorizing vehicle types on the basis of the FHWA scheme but also is capable of grouping vehicles into more detailed classes. The classification model can successfully classify vehicles into 15 classes using single-loop detector data without any explicit axle information. In addition, the advantages of the proposed vehicle classification model are its simplicity, its use of the current detection infrastructure, and its enhancement of the use of single-loop detectors for vehicle classification. The initial results also suggest the potential for transferability of the vehicle classification approach and are very encouraging.

J	Harding, J				Harding, Jochen			New Behavioral Model for Microscopic Freeway Traffic-Flow Simulation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								A new behavioral model for microscopic freeway traffic-flow simulation is presented. As a key feature, the model is subdivided into small modules, each dealing with one distinct problem or intention of the current driving task. The modules operate independently of each other. Each module provides a situation-based vote for the longitudinal and the lateral movement of the vehicle. Subsequently, the individual votes are combined by applying a procedure that can be described as a virtual fuzzification. The model also incorporates the chronological sequence of the individual votes; decisions depend not only on the current evaluation of a driving task but also on the trend of prior evaluations. Thus, it emulates actual driver behavior. The behavioral model was implemented into the simulation software BABSIM and field tested. It is shown that the model is valid for various applications ranging from rather simple freeway sections over a lane reduction up to complex multilane on ramps and off ramps. Thus, the new approach is a valuable contribution to freeway traffic-flow modeling and simulation. It provides more accurate results and a more flexible use of the simulation software. At the same time, the straightforward and concise structure of the model simplifies its maintenance and ensures the expandability of the concept. All this promotes further use of traffic-flow simulation and leads the way for promising future developments.

This paper presents a method of predicting safety for planning alternatives. Although applicable to large road networks, the method predicts crashes at the road facility level (intersections and segments). Thus it is suitable for joint evaluation of modifications of the road network, changes in network traffic flows, and improvements in road geometry considered by planners. A complete set of crash prediction models was developed by the authors for seven types of road segments and four types of road nodes on the basis of crashes reported on Indiana highways from 2003 to 2005. A mainstream research method has been used: negative binomial regression with a stepwise method for variable selection and the Akaike information criterion. The obtained equations are transparent to transportation planners and allow efficient computations for large road networks. The crash prediction equations have been implemented in the GIS-based planning package TransCAD as an add-on tool. The calibration procedure included in the tool allows a planner to search for optimal values of calibration factors if calibration of crash prediction models is needed.

Capacity Reduction at Incidents Empirical Data Collected from a Helicopter	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Incidents on freeways cause large delays for road users. These delays depend largely on the capacity at the incident location, which is determined by the drivers' behavior at the accident location. Few empirical facts are available on traffic operations during an incident. This paper presents high-quality videos of the traffic flow around two accidents recorded from a helicopter. From the collected images, traffic counts have been performed at the exact location of the incident. This has two advantages. First, the capacity at the bottleneck per lane could be estimated. Second, truck counts could be converted to passenger car units at the location of the bottleneck. Counts show that the (outflow) capacity of the remaining lanes is about 50% lower than the (free-flow) capacity of the same number of lanes. This means that the road capacity in the opposite direction is reduced by half by the rubbernecking effect. The capacity of the road in the direction of the accident is reduced by more than half because not all lanes are in use. The images provide information on the causes for the capacity reduction. A leader accelerates and the follower accelerates a short time later. The average time between these two accelerations is estimated at about 3 s, but the video also shows a large spread of these times. The results can be used to assess consequences of incidents, in an analytical way and in macroscopic or microscopic traffic simulators.

J	Ozguven, EE; Ozbay, K				Ozguven, Eren Erman; Ozbay, Kaan			Nonparametric Bayesian Estimation of Freeway Capacity Distribution from Censored Observations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Previous studies have been made of the usefulness and effectiveness of survival analysis in transportation and traffic engineering studies with incomplete data in which the Kaplan-Meier estimate is proposed for determining traffic capacity distribution. However, well-known estimators like Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen have several disadvantages that make it difficult to obtain the traffic capacity distribution. First, neither estimator is defined for all values of traffic flows possible. That is, the maximum How followed by a breakdown defines the final point of the estimated distribution curve. Therefore, parametric fitting tools have to be applied to obtain the remaining portion of the curve. Moreover, the discontinuity and nonsmoothness of the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen estimates make it difficult to ensure the robustness of the estimation. In this paper the Kaplan-Meier and Nelson-Aalen nonparametric estimators, are used to obtain the traffic capacity function of four freeway sections. Then a Bayesian nonparametric estimator, which is shown to be a Bayesian extension of the Kaplan-Meier estimator, is introduced for estimating the capacity distribution. This estimator assumes a Dirichlet process prior for the survival function under the minimization of a squared-error loss function. The results indicate that the curves obtained by using the Bayesian estimation method are smoother than those obtained with the other estimator. This smoothness also ensures the continuity in the vicinity of censored observations. Furthermore, the Bayesian estimates can be obtained for any traffic flow value regardless of the availability of data only for certain ranges of observations (including censored data).

Data are presented from the new high-resolution traffic How data sets produced through the Federal Highway Administration's Next Generation Simulation Model (NGSIM) project to show a fundamentally new way of looking at the queue discharge process. The characteristics of this process are related to a time-distance domain map showing the basic timing parameters and detection zone length. A new way of computing passage time is suggested, based on actual travel speeds through the detection zone area and a clearer relationship between passage time, minimum green time, and detection zone length.

J	Ciuffo, B; Punzo, V; Torrieri, V				Ciuffo, Biagio; Punzo, Vincenzo; Torrieri, Vincenzo			Comparison of Simulation-Based and Model-Based Calibrations of Traffic-Flow Microsimulation Models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Parameter calibration of traffic microsimulation models usually takes the form of a simulation-based optimization problem, that is, an optimization in which every objective function evaluation calls for a simulation. It is recognized that such a problem is computationally intractable. Running time grows exponentially both in the number of parameters and in the digits accuracy. In addition, considerable computing time is required by each objective function evaluation. This means that only heuristic techniques can be applied. Accordingly, results of the application of the OptQuest/Multistart algorithm to the calibration of AIMSUN microsimulation model parameters on a freeway network are presented. Furthermore, it is claimed that the search for an effective solution to the calibration problem cannot be exhausted by the choice of the most efficient optimization algorithm. The use of available information concerning the phenomenon could allow calibration performance to be enhanced, for example, by reducing dimensions of the domain of feasible solutions. It is argued that this goal could be achieved by using information from the stationary counterpart of microscopic traffic-flow models that depict the aggregate variables of traffic flows as a function of drivers' microscopic parameters. Because they have a closed analytical formulation, they are well suited for faster calibrations. Results show that values of parameters from stationary model-based calibrations are not far from the optimal ones. Thus the integration of the two approaches cannot be excluded but is worth investigating.

J	Wolshon, B				Wolshon, Brian			Empirical characterization of mass evacuation traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Among the many gaps in the current state of mass evacuation planning and analysis practice has been a lack of the field-based study of traffic flows under actual evacuation conditions. Without observational studies of such conditions, the simulations and forecasts of roadway performance during emergencies have historically been based on conjecture and professional judgment. However, the recent series of hurricane evacuations along the U.S. Gulf Coast has given investigators the opportunity to collect and evaluate traffic conditions during evacuation scenarios. This paper uses recently collected traffic data from two recent evacuations in Louisiana to assess how well various roadway classifications in different geographic areas were able to carry traffic during emergencies under both normal-flow and contraflow operations. The objectives were to characterize the general conditions of traffic flow under an evacuation condition, to address lingering questions related to maximum sustainable flows, and to examine how the flows compared with those suggested in the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM). The findings of this work suggest that during evacuations most roadways carry flows well below the HCM-predicted maximums and that despite the enormous demand conditions generated by a mass evacuation, the maximum flows on urban roadways typically do not even reach those of typical daily commuter periods.

From Existing Accident-Free Car-Following Models to Colliding Vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; CALIBRATION; VALIDATION	The study explores the specifications of microscopic traffic models that could capture congestion dynamics and model accident-prone behaviors on a highway section in greater realism than existing models currently used in practice (commercial software). A comparative assessment of several major acceleration models is conducted, especially for congestion formation and incident modeling. On the basis of this assessment, alternative specifications for car-following and lane-changing models are developed and implemented in a microscopic simulation framework. The models are calibrated and compared for resulting vehicle trajectories and macroscopic flow-density relationships. Experiments are conducted with the models under different degrees of relaxation of the safety constraints typically applied in conjunction with simulation codes used in practice. The ability of the proposed specifications to capture traffic behavior in extreme situations is examined. The results suggest that these specifications offer an improved basis for microscopic traffic simulation for situations that do not require an accident-free environment. As such, the same basic behavior model structure could accommodate both extreme situations (evacuation scenarios, oversaturated networks) as well as normal daily traffic conditions.

J	Marchal, F; de Palma, A				Marchal, Fabrice; de Palma, Andre			Measurement of Uncertainty Costs with Dynamic Traffic Simulations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							URBAN FREEWAY CONGESTION; INFORMATION PROVISION; CHOICE; TIME	Nonrecurrent congestion in transportation networks occurs as a consequence of stochastic factors affecting demand and supply. Intelligent transportation systems such as advanced traveler information systems and advanced traffic management systems are designed to reduce the impacts of nonrecurrent congestion by providing information to a fraction of users or by controlling the variability of traffic flows. For these reasons, the design of these systems requires a reliable forecast of nonrecurrent congestion. A new method is proposed to measure the impacts of nonrecurrent congestion on travel costs by taking risk aversion into account. The traffic model is based on the dynamic traffic simulation model METROPOLIS. Incidents are generated randomly by reducing the capacity of the network. Users can instantaneously adapt to the unexpected travel conditions or can also change their behavior through a day-to-day adjustment process. Comparisons with incident-free simulations provide a benchmark for potential travel time savings that can he brought about by a state-of-the-art information system. The impact of variable travel conditions is measured by describing the willingness to pay to avoid risky or unreliable Journeys. Indeed, for risk-averse drivers, any uncertainty corresponds to a utility loss. This utility loss is computed for several levels of network disruption. The main result of the study is that the utility loss due to uncertainty is of the same order of magnitude as the total travel costs.

A new behavioral algorithm for oversaturated freeway flow can be used in microscopic simulation models; it was developed as part of the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) project, sponsored by FHWA. The proposed algorithm is an integrated car-following and lane-changing modeling framework that is consistent with the kinematic wave theory. The algorithm can explicitly model mandatory and discretionary lane changing, including cooperation during lane changing. As an extension of the algorithm, a new on-ramp merging model was developed and incorporated into the model. The proposed algorithm also accounts for the relaxation process following lane changing. The proposed model includes a small number of parameters that can be readily measured in the field. The proposed model was implemented into a microscopic simulator, and it was validated with both vehicle trajectory data and macroscopic detector data from an NGSIM test site. The results show good agreement with real-world traffic behavior. The study products, including an algorithm description, analysis results, and computer code, are documented and made available to developers and users of traffic simulation tools.

J	Perco, P				Perco, Paolo			Comparison Between Powered Two-Wheeler and Passenger Car Free-Flow Speeds in Urban Areas	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Accident data indicate that motorcyclists are a particularly vulnerable group of road users because they run a higher risk of being injured or killed in an accident than passenger car drivers. One of the countermeasures that can improve traffic safety for motorcyclists is an increase in awareness and knowledge about powered two-wheelers (PTWs) in the planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of new and existing roads. Road design standards and policies that regulate design process and safety evaluations are usually based on passenger car characteristics only. In particular, the passenger car operating speed is used as the critical input for design choices of geometric elements connected with traffic safety and as a performance measure to evaluate road design and consistency. Because the passenger car operating speed might not be representative of the PTW operating speed, this study compared the PTW and passenger car speed distributions in urban areas to establish definitively whether they are similar. The results showed that PTW speeds are always considerably higher than passenger car speeds and that the corresponding operating speeds are correlated. Therefore, a prediction equation to estimate the PTW operating speed starting from passenger car operating speed was developed for urban streets. This equation can help highway engineers to estimate expected PTW speeds that can be effectively used in the safety evaluations of new and existing roads where the significant presence of PTW's in the traffic flow suggests that this vehicle type should be considered.

J	Kerner, BS				Kerner, Boris S.			On-Ramp Metering Based on Three-Phase Traffic Theory Downstream Off-Ramp and Upstream On-Ramp Bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								An ANCONA method is suggested for control of congestion at an off-ramp bottleneck through the use of feedback on-ramp metering at an upstream on-ramp bottleneck. The method is based on a recent ANCONA method for feedback on-ramp metering at an isolated on-ramp bottleneck, which allows congestion to set in at the bottleneck. With the use of the Kerner-Klenov traffic flow model in the context of three-phase traffic theory, simulations of ANCONA for a section of highway with downstream off-ramp and upstream on-ramp bottlenecks are made. It was found that if a wide moving jam occurs spontaneously within synchronized flow, then through the use of ANCONA, emergence of a wide moving jam can be prevented. As a result, a congested pattern at the off-ramp bottleneck, which consists of synchronized flow of higher speed (about or higher than 60 km/h) only, is spatially limited, that is, congestion does not propagate continuously upstream.

A comprehensive case study uses a real freeway network to reveal how different data coverage affects the quality of estimated O-D tables. The dynamic O-D estimation problem is formulated as a variational inequality (VI) problem that provides a flexible framework to incorporate different data sources and to encapsulate realistic traffic flow dynamics. Traffic surveillance data considered include traffic counts from vehicle detectors, historical O-D tables (static or dynamic), and travel time measurements on subpaths. A novel method is employed to evaluate marginal path travel times, which is a key procedure to properly incorporate travel time measurements into the VI formulation. Numerical experiments generate a number of guidelines to the proper selection of data coverage for obtaining improved O-D estimates.	[Zhang, H.

J	Di, S; Pan, CX; Ran, B				Di, Shan; Pan, Changxuan; Ran, Bin			Stochastic Multiclass Traffic Assignment with Consideration of Risk-Taking Behaviors	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							ROAD NETWORK; RELIABILITY; EQUILIBRIUM; TIME	A study of the problem of predicting traffic flows under traffic equilibrium in a stochastic transportation network is presented. Travelers' risk-taking behaviors are explicitly modeled with respect to probabilistic travel times. Traveling risks are quantified from the travel time distributions directly and are embedded in the route choice conditions. The classification of risk-neutral, risk-averse, and risk-prone travelers is based on their preferred traveling risks. The formulation of the model clarifies that travelers with different risk preferences have the same objective-to save travel time cost-though they may make different route choices. The proposed solution algorithm is applicable for networks with normal distribution link travel times theoretically. Further simulation analysis shows that it can also be applied to approximate the equilibrium network flows for other frequently used travel time distribution families: gamma, Weibull, and log-normal. The proposed model was applied to a test network and a medium-sized transportation network. The results demonstrate that the model captures travelers' risk-taking behaviors more realistically and flexibly compared with existing stochastic traffic equilibrium models.

The study, used the 5-min traffic flow data before the crash obtained from loop detectors to identify the traffic conditions contributing to crashes on ramps. With 5 years of ramp crash data on the Interstate 4 freeway in Orlando, Florida, a two-level nested logit model was developed to estimate the probabilities of crash occurrence for different ramp types and configurations. I it the comparison of two nest structures, the traffic flow parameters contributing to crash occurrence greatly differed between on-ramps and off-ramps. The results of the model estimation suggested that the main-line speeds immediately upstream and downstream of ramps and the volume on ramps were correlated to crash occurrence on ramps. It is recommended that these traffic flow parameters be monitored in real time to detect elevated risk in traffic conditions on ramps within on-line systems for freeway traffic management.

C.; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.; Schreuder, Marco			FASTLANE New Multiclass First-Order Traffic Flow Model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							SIMULATION; WAVES	The heterogeneity of traffic is a significant if not dominant factor in accurately modeling freeway traffic flow operations. For example, high truck percentages may induce congestion at much lower volumes, and hence different network traffic conditions may result than with low truck percentages. This implies that traffic models for real-time decision support systems in traffic management centers should provide the means to account for traffic heterogeneity. A new, multiclass, first-order traffic model is presented that provides these means and is implemented in the decision-support system BOSS-Offline, operational in all five highway traffic management centers in the Netherlands. FASTLANE differs from earlier multiclass first-order macroscopic traffic models in that it calculates the dynamics in terms of state-dependent (instead of constant) passenger-car equivalents, which is in line with both theory and empirical microscopic data. The model is numerically solved by an efficient and stable Godunov-based solver while maintaining a dynamic and realistic representation of class-specific flows and densities throughout the network. In two synthetic test cases and one based on real data, the workings of FASTLANE under different truck percentages and different conditions are demonstrated.	[van Lint, J. W.

J	Duret, A; Buisson, C; Chiabaut, N				Duret, Aurelien; Buisson, Christine; Chiabaut, Nicolas			Estimating Individual Speed-Spacing Relationship and Assessing Ability of Newell's Car-Following Model to Reproduce Trajectories	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MICROSCOPIC SIMULATION-MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; VALIDATION; CALIBRATION; SYSTEM	Capturing variability within flow is an important task for traffic flow models. The linearity of the congested part of the fundamental diagram induces a linear speed-spacing relationship at an individual level, characterized by two parameters. This study assumes that most intervehicle variability can be accounted for by estimating these two parameters for each vehicle. Two methods are presented to quantify individual linear speed-spacing relationships. The first method is based on data: it estimates the speed-spacing relationship by fitting the experimental speed-spacing scatter plot with a straight line. The second method is based on simulation: it computes the optimum parameters so that the simulated trajectories obtained by Newell's car-following algorithm reproduce as closely as possible the experimental vehicle's trajectories. Both proposed methods are implemented on the Next Generation Simulation trajectory data set recorded on I-80. The individual parameters for the speed-spacing relationship are quantified, and their distributions are specified. The need to distinguish driver behavior on a lane-by-lane basis is discussed. The results tend to prove that taking into account individual variability between drivers can improve the accuracy of simulated trajectories.

This CA model is in the framework of three phase traffic theory and can reproduce the first order phase transition from the free flow to synchronized flow (Jiang and Wu, 2005, European Physical Journal B, 46, 581-584). It is shown when some special homogeneous boundary conditions are used, the capacity of the on-ramp system is greatly enhanced because the strong interactions of main road vehicles and on-ramp vehicles, which occur under inhomogencous boundary conditions, are avoided. Based on this finding, we propose a new design of road section upstream of on-ramp, i.e., to split the main road into several branches and then the branches merge together. With the help of traffic light control, the inhomogeneous vehicles are homogenized. Accordingly, the capacity is enhanced.

Operational effects of acceleration lane on main traffic flow at discontinuities	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						macroscopic model; on/off ramp; model validation; linear stability analysis	KINEMATIC WAVES; MODEL; DERIVATION; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; STATES	Recent Studies have indicated that on-ramp flow is important ill the formation of the stop-and-go traffic flow near the ramp. Several models have been developed to explain the complex phenomena associated with ramps which result ill the hysteretic phase transitions. A good understanding of the mechanisms of congestion near. on-ramps is very useful tor the development of Suitable control and highway design measures. To this end, ill this paper traffic flow operations oil a freeway with all on-ramp are investigated based on a newly developed second order macroscopic model, The proposed model allows to take into account the influences of the acceleration lane length oil the flow dynamics of the main carriageway. The main aim of this paper is, therefore, to investigate analytically and numerically the effects of acceleration lane length oil traffic flow operations. It is found that different acceleration lane lengths result ill various congested traffic states.

Development of microscopic simulation model for heterogeneous traffic using object oriented approach	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						heterogeneity; traffic flow; simulation; object-oriented languages; computer programming	CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL	Roads in India carry heterogeneous traffic with wide variations in static and dynamic characteristics of vehicles. The traffic flow is also generally devoid of lane discipline, with vehicles occupying any available road space ahead. Modeling of Such heterogeneous traffic is generally complex in nature and simulation has been proven to be effective in Studying Such traffic. This paper presents the development of a model through object oriented programming (OOP) approach for simulating heterogeneous traffic. Several unique traffic characteristics have been considered in the modeling process. C++ language is used for this purpose. OOP leads to better structured codes for simulation and facilitates the development, maintainability and expandability of such codes. The first part of the paper explains the various logics of simulation such as vehicle generation, vehicle placement and vehicle movement. The second part of the paper describes the features of OOP, description of classes and class relationships. The last part of the paper presents the validation and advantages of the developed model.

Comparative study on GPS and cellular probe techniques for freeway travel speed estimations	URBAN TRANSPORT XIV: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	2008	MALTA	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Built Environm		data collection; speed estimation; GPS; cellular probe; sample size; confidence level		Traffic data, such as travel speed and travel time, is by nature stochastic. In order to deploy Intelligent Transportation Systems successfully, efficient, accurate, and sufficient collection of traffic data in a timely manner without interrupting the traffic flows is one of the imperative first steps. It is evident that travel speed estimates by gathering traffic data with moving vehicles is more representative of highway performance than the point estimates of speed from fixed detectors. Recently, GPS and cellular probe techniques have been researched and practiced in academic and industrial areas all around the world. The use of GPS and cellular probes for obtaining traffic data appears to be technically feasible. Still, there is little evidence to demonstrate that either system can be practically implemented. The comparative study conducted in this paper has integrated the possible real attributes of GPS and cellular probe systems, such as location accuracy, probe penetration rate and update frequency, into simulation on a real transportation network, and has developed methods for freeway travel speed estimation. The findings from simulation show that either of these two techniques has its own pros and cons. Cellular probe has wider probe penetration rate than GPS, which relieves the dependency on location accuracy, but the low update frequency reduces the coverage and accuracy of link travel speed estimation in the network. The GPS probe has a high update frequency, but the low probe penetration rate and the subsequent strong dependency on location accuracy are big obstacles to obtaining enough samples for link travel speed estimation. Thus, combining these two technologies of wide cellular probe rate and high GPS update frequency should provide better estimation of traffic conditions.	[He, R.

In mesh networks, the coding opportunities depend on the co-location of multiple traffic flows. With fixed routes given by a routing protocol, the coding opportunities are limited. This paper presents a new protocol called BEND, which combines the features of network coding and opportunistic forwarding in 802.11-based mesh networks to create more coding opportunities in the network. Taking advantage of redundancy of packets among the forwarder candidates, our protocol bends the routes locally and dynamically to attain better coding opportunities. This higher coding gain is verified using a network simulator.

The bond graph technique for the macroscopic and microscopic traffic flow description	WMSCI 2008: 12TH WORLD MULTI-CONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL V, PROCEEDINGS			English	Proceedings Paper	12th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics/14th International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis	JUN 29-JUL 02, 2008	Orlando, FL	Int Inst Informat & System, Int Federat Syst Res		Traffic flow; Macroscopic modelling; Microscopic modelling; LW model; Cellular Automata; Bond Graph	PETRI NETS; MODEL; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAY; WAVES	To contribute to answer some of the main issues for large scale traffic flow problems and in order to integrate the road activity in the total supply chain, we applied the Bond Graph approach in this field. Where this approach intervenes to represent the dynamic behavior of systems by using a graphic language unified for all engineering's fields. The objective was to develop a traffic model that can be easily adapted to the aimed analysis level. Such model makes it possible to describe the collective vehicular flow dynamic within a traffic network. Moreover, it makes it possible to be focused on the behaviour of individual vehicles and their interactions. With this intention, firstly, we have developed a macroscopic Bond Graph model of the traffic flow. Indeed, we used the bond graph approach to develop a dynamic traffic system model in which the global characteristics of traffic flow (flow rate, density, and velocity) are re-interpreted by the bond graph parameters. The graphic character of the Bond Graph opens the possibility of directly representing on a graph, the average flow rate and the density through the intermediary of the power variables of Bond Graph, while explaining the specific logic used and expressing the semantics of the phenomena which occur. Then, we adapted this macroscopic Bond Graph model to the description of the flow composition of vehicles and their interactions. To describe the traffic flow in a finer way, we identified again the Bond Graph parameters of the model already developed, where we exploited, on the one hand the definitions of a microscopic model (cellular Automata) and, on the other hand the principle of spatial discretization of the traffic model. This adaptation carried out to develop the microscopic Bond Graph model of the traffic flow which allows describing the behavior of vehicles flow more finely.

Different traffic flow models were established for the cases with and without the alternate controlling regulation based on the Fukui-Ishibashi cellular automaton traffic model. With the models, the traffic behavior at the interfluent location of on-ramp was investigated and some results were obtained. When there are many inflowing vehicles on the elevated road and ramp, the traffic situation on the elevated road with the controlling regulation is much better than that without it; when there are less inflowing vehicles, the elevated road situation on the whole remains the same in the two cases.

They apply this method to the well-documented cases of seasonal influenza outbreaks in the United States and France. In the United States (using data for 1972-2002), the authors observed strong short-range correlations between several states and their immediate neighbors, as well as robust long-range spreading patterns resulting from large domestic air-traffic flows. The stability of these results over time allowed the authors to draw conclusions about the possible impact of travel restrictions on epidemic spread. The authors also applied this method to the case of France (1984-2004) and found that on the regional scale, there was no transportation mode that clearly dominated disease spread. The simplicity and robustness of this method suggest that it could be a useful tool for detecting transmission channels in the spread of epidemics.

The air quality measurements consisted of long path optical measurements of NO at distances of 7 and 17 in from the edge of the highway. Sonic anemometers were used to measure wind speed and turbulent velocities at 6 and 20m from the highway. Traffic flow rates were monitored using traffic surveillance cameras. The dispersion model [Venkatram, A., 2004. On estimating emissions through horizontal fluxes. Atmospheric Environment 38, 2439-2446] explained over 60% of the variance of the observed path averaged NO concentrations, and over 90% of the observed concentrations were within a factor of two of the model estimates. Sensitivity tests conducted with the model indicated that the traffic flow rate made the largest contribution to the variance of the observed NO concentrations. The meteorological variable that had the largest impact on the near road NO concentrations was the standard deviation of the vertical velocity fluctuations, sigma(w). Wind speed had a relatively minor effect on concentrations. Furthermore, as long as the wind direction was within +/- 45 degrees from the normal to the road, wind direction had little impact on near road concentrations. The measurements did not allow us to draw conclusions on the impact of traffic-induced turbulence on dispersion. The analysis of air quality and meteorological observations resulted in plausible estimates of on-road emission factors for NO. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Bassan, S; Polus, A; Faghri, A				Bassan, Shy; Polus, Abishai; Faghri, Ardeshir			Modeling of freeway breakdown process with log-periodic oscillations	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						log-periodic oscillations; breakdown flow; stock crash; transition; traffic density		Urban and suburban freeways are designed to allow smooth traffic flow at high speed. However, when traffic demand is high or during irregular events, significant congestion may develop. Traffic breakdown occurs during the phase transition from dense congested stable (DCS) flow to breakdown flow. In this study, the process of freeway flow breakdown was investigated by calibrating models in the density-time plane using morning peak data from Interstate 66, a US highway connecting Washington, D. C., and Virginia. It was shown that the models, which describe the collective behavior of drivers using the mathematical property of the log-periodic oscillations (LPO) process, reflect suitably the phase transition in freeway traffic flow. The LPO process has been used in the past to model stock market crashes and the occurrences of large earthquakes. The cyclic properties of the LPO models developd in this study were found to identify the "critical transition period,'' which triggers the traffic breakdown process. This period starts when the density rate of change reaches its maximum during the first cycle that follows the DCS flow regime. This triggers a breakdown of flow conditions, which occur 5-8 min after the density rate of change has achieved its maximum.

Vehicles on road are treated as particles hopping on lattice. In the morning rush hours, downtown parking lots are taken as the sinks for particles moving from suburban; in the afternoon rush hours, the parking lots become the sources for particles moving out of town. The traffic is regulated by the operation of a series of traffic lights. Both the traffic flow (from global perspective) and the travel time (from personal perspective) are studied. As the traffic patterns response to the traffic lights, the phase transition is defined by the pattern shift.

CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SYNCHRONIZED FLOW; SIMULATION; RULES; PATTERNS; VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; STATES	In this paper, the effects of passing lanes on traffic flow on a single-lane highway are investigated based on a cellular-automaton (CA) model proposed by Lee et al. (2004) with periodic boundary conditions. A new driving strategy for the diverging and interacting processes are proposed by considering dual-time-headways (an interaction headway and a safe headway) as the criteria for a vehicle to select a lane or change lane. The proposed dual-headway rule has a clear physical sense and can be calibrated in the real world. We can see that (i) At low- (or high-) densities, there are no obvious increases of flux due to very weak (or very strong) interactions between vehicles. However, flux has an obvious increase at intermediate-density regions with the increase of the length of a passing lane; (ii) the space-time patterns before a passing lane are different from that after a passing lane, which is caused from vehicular reconfigurations on a passing zone; (iii) passing lanes can merge several narrow jams into one or few wide jams when increasing the length of passing lanes; (iv) if vehicles are allowed to travel with even higher speed, traffic can be further improved.

J	Chu, YC; Zhou, XS; Hernandez, J				Chu, Yi-Chang; Zhou, Xuesong; Hernandez, Jessica			Evaluating urban downtown one-way to two-way street conversion using multiple resolution simulation and assignment approach	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							TRAFFIC COUNTS; DESTINATION	There is a developing trend to change the flow configuration in urban downtown or central business districts (CBD) from one way to two way. However, it has been difficult to reasonably estimate the traffic flow resulting from the two-way conversion. This paper presents a multiple resolution simulation and assignment approach to estimate traffic and environmental impacts due to different flow configuration scenarios. It is based on the logical integration of an origin-destination (OD) matrix estimation method, a mesoscopic traffic simulation model, and a microscopic dynamic traffic assignment model. The dynamic traffic assignment model is employed in conjunction with a method to estimate dynamic OD demand from collected link and movement traffic counts to reassign the traffic onto the proposed two-way flow configurations. The reassigned traffic is then loaded into the microscopic simulation model to permit detailed analysis of traffic and environmental impacts. A case study based on the El Paso, Tex. CBD network is conducted to illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology. The application highlights the unique features in the methodological aspect and illustrates the considerable benefits resulting from the proposed MRSA framework. Possible drawbacks and benefits of the conversion are discussed.

Traffic factors for the design of roadway geometrics and pavement structures in Kuwait	KUWAIT JOURNAL OF SCIENCE & ENGINEERING			English	Article								Traffic volume on a road network is an important factor in the planning and design of roadway facilities. Geometric and structural design of roadways depends among other factors on traffic volumes, their mix characteristics, loads., and their distribution with time of the day, day of the week and month of the year. Roadway geometries and pavement designs in Kuwait are usually carried out using assumed values for traffic flow including those of AADT, PHV, DHV, D-factor, %k factor, design lane factor and speed. It is also a common practice to estimate AADT from short-term counts using judgmental expansion factors. The absence of realistic data with regard to the above factors may lead to erroneous designs. Errors in design may be of concern from economic and road safety points of view. Kuwait University and the Ministry of Interior established continuous count stations at seventeen locations on the four functional types of roadways in Kuwait. This paper presents the calculated values of the traffic parameters for use in geometric and pavement designs of different classes of roadways, which were determined from data obtained from the continuous traffic count stations. The results are expected to be of considerable benefit to several public and private agencies including the Ministry of Public Works, Ministry of Interior, Kuwait Municipality, as well as planning and engineering consultants in Kuwait.

In 2002, the introduction of DENV-3 in the state of Bahia produced a massive epidemic and the first cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Based on the standardized frequency, timing and location of viral isolations by the state Central Laboratory, DENV-3 probably entered Bahia through its capital, Salvador, and then rapidly disseminated to other cities, following the main roads. A linear regression model that included traffic flow, distance from the capital and DENV-1 circulation (r(2) - 0.24, p = 0.001) supported this hypothesis. This pattern was not seen for serotypes already in circulation and was not seen for DENV-3 in the following year. Human population density was another important factor in the intensity of viral circulation. Neither DENV-1 nor DENV- 2 fit this model for 2001 or 2003. Since the vector has limited flight range and vector densities fail to correlate with intensity of viral circulation, this distribution represents the movement of infected people and to some extent mosquitoes. This pattern may mimic person-to-person spread of a new infection.

This modification improves the transit capacity of the model, which results in a much higher simulated flux. Moreover, in a circular road, this model simulates an abnormal hysteresis effect.

J	Oda, T				Oda, Toshihiko			Signal control by successive updating of control parameters based on prediction of traffic flow	ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING IN JAPAN			English	Article						traffic signal control; updating of control parameters; switching of control; prediction of traffic flow; traffic delay		yIn traditional coordinated traffic signal control on an urban road network, the following two problems occur. First, the conventional method involves a tithe lag between traffic measurement and signal control. Second, an abrupt switching of control parameters throws the traffic flow into disorder. This paper proposes a new approach to avoid these problems. We increase the frequency of switching. The control parameters are switched as frequently as every two cycles. At the time of switching, minor variations of the ongoing plan are generated. For each variation of plan, traffic delay at each intersection is predicted based on measured traffic data at upstream detectors. Then the plan minimizing the delay is chosen to be the control parameters in the next cycle. In order to evaluate the validity of this approach, experiments were carried out using a traffic simulator. The experiments indicate that the proposed method reduces the queue length significantly, compared with the conventional method. 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Four cases that the stop locates upstream or downstream the intersection, and ones with the special stop lane or not are considered. The effect of the distance LD between the stop and the intersection on the capacity is studied, with respect to the traffic light cycle T and the bus dwell time T,. It is found that acting as a bottleneck, the bus stop near the intersection causes the drop of the capacity. The negative effect only appears below a critical point LD,, which is related to the T and the T, in no stop lane cases. The larger T and T, have the tendency to create the higher loss of the capacity. While for stop lane cases, the critical value LD, changes little. Comparisons among four cases suggest that the special stop lane can effectively enhance the capacity, and the downstream stops perform better than the upstream ones at small LD or small Tor large T,. The results imply that the capacity can be maximized by adjusting both the position of the bus stop and the cycle time, or adding a special stop lane. These findings may be useful to offer scientific guidance for the management and the design of traffic networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the BML models, a first-order phase transition occurs between the low-density moving phase in which all cars move at maximal speed and the high-density jammed phase in which all cars are stopped. However, it is not a physical result of a realistic system. We propose a new traffic rule in a two-dimensional traffic flow model containing road sections, which reflects that a car cannot enter into a road crossing if the road section in front of the crossing is occupied by another car. The simulation results reveal a second-order phase transition that separates the free flow phase from the jammed phase. In this way the system will not be entirely jammed ("don't block the box" as in New York City). (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ngoduy, D; Liu, R				Ngoduy, D.; Liu, R.			Multiclass first-order simulation model to explain non-linear traffic phenomena	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; multiclass; first-order model; non-linear traffic phenomena	KINEMATIC WAVES; FLOW; DERIVATION	With the first-order traffic model of Lighthill, Whitham and Richard (LWR), many simple traffic problems can be represented analytically such as a shock formation. However, the LWR model has some deficiencies. For example, among the other things, it fails to replicate interesting non-linear phenomena such as hysteresis and capacity drop as well as the dispersion of traffic platoon when there exists a distribution of desired speeds in heterogeneous traffic. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel multiclass first-order simulation model based on an approximation of Riemann solver. In the developed model, each vehicle class is only characterized by their desired speeds in a free-flow traffic state where overtaking is allowed. However, when traffic is congested, all vehicle classes must travel at the same congested speed and overtaking is not possible. Numerical results show that the proposed model is not only more accurate and reliable than the existing models but also able to explain non-linear traffic phenomena on freeways.

We propose a methodology that is focused on the user while being able to improve the software development activities. The models are formally specified, avoiding a high number of errors in the application, thus reducing the problem solving time. Streets are characterized by their traffic direction, number of lanes, etc. Once the urban section is outlined, the traffic flow is automatically set up. Specialized behavior is included to model traffic lights, trucks, traffic signs, railways, etc. The basic idea is to provide a mapping into DEVS and Cell-DEVS models that can be easily executed with a simulation tool. As the modelers can focus on the problem to solve, development times for the simulators can be dramatically reduced. A front-end system allows the user to draw city sections (and then parse the drawing to create a valid ATLAS file), and an output subsystem permitting cars to be shown with realistic 3D graphics.

Contributory factors to traffic crashes at signalized intersections in Hong Kong	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						signalized intersections; crash incidence; Poisson regression; negative binomial regression	ACCIDENT; OPTIMIZATION; PREDICTION; EXPOSURE; POISSON	Efficient geometric design and signal timing not only improve operational performance at signalized intersections by expanding capacity and reducing traffic delays, but also result in an appreciable reduction in traffic conflicts, and thus better road safety. Information on the incidence of crashes, traffic flow, geometric design, road environment, and traffic control at 262 signalized intersections in Hong Kong during 2002 and 2003 are incorporated into a crash prediction model. Poisson regression and negative binomial regression are used to quantify the influence of possible contributory factors on the incidence of killed and severe injury (KSI) crashes and slight injury crashes, respectively, while possible interventions by traffic flow are controlled. The results for the incidence of slight injury crashes reveal that the road environment, degree of curvature, and presence of tram stops are significant factors, and that traffic volume has a diminishing effect on the crash risk. The presence of tram stops, number of pedestrian streams, road environment, proportion of commercial vehicles, average lane width, and degree of curvature increase the risk of KSI crashes, but the effect of traffic volume is negligible.

To meet this goal, intensive field campaigns were conducted and simulations were performed, using the flexible air quality regional model (FARM), to study winter and summer pollution episodes. The simulations were performed using a complete emission inventory that included traffic flow model results of the Roman street network to better describe, with respect to the available diffuse national emission inventory, the hourly variation of traffic emissions in the city. The meteorological reconstruction was performed by means of both prognostic and diagnostic models by using experimental data collected during the field campaigns. To evaluate the capability of the FARM model to capture the main features of the selected episodes, a comparison of modelled results against observed air quality data for different pollutants was performed at urban and rural sites. FARM performed well in predicting ozone (O-3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations, showing a good reproduction of both daily peaks and their diurnal variations. The model also showed a good capability to reproduce the magnitude of volatile alkane, aromatic and carbonyl compound concentrations. PM10 model results revealed the tendency to under-predict the observed values. PM composition model results were compared with observed data, evidencing good results for elemental carbon (EC), nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), (SO42-) underestimation for sulphate (SO42-) and poor performance for organic matter (OM). The soil components of PM were found to be significantly under-predicted by the model, especially during Saharan dust episodes. Overall, the study results show large areas of high O-3 and PM10 concentrations where levels of pollutants should be carefully monitored and population exposure evaluated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Gokhale, S; Pandian, S				Gokhale, Sharad; Pandian, Suresh			A semi-empirical box modeling approach for predicting the carbon monoxide concentrations at an urban traffic intersection	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						traffic flow rate; vehicle emission rate; vehicle density; semi-empirical box air quality model; carbon monoxide concentration	LINE-SOURCE MODEL; EMISSION FACTORS; TUNNEL MEASUREMENTS; PASSENGER CARS; STREET CANYONS; AIR-QUALITY; VEHICLES; ROAD; VALIDATION; DISPERSION	Emissions generated roadside and at intersections are observed to be affected when there is a sudden change in the traffic flow pattern or increase in the vehicular population, particularly, during peak hours and during special events. The vehicles that queue up at traffic intersections spend a longer amount of time in idle driving mode generating more pollutant emissions per unit time. Other driving patterns (i.e., acceleration, deceleration and cruising) are also observed at intersections, affecting the emission pattern and therefore the resulting pollutant concentrations. The emission rate is not only affected by the increase in the vehicular population but also by the constantly changing traffic flow patterns and vehicles' driving modes. The nature of the vehicle flows also affects the rate and nature of the dispersion of pollutants in the vicinity of the road, influencing the pollutant concentration. It is, therefore, too complex to simulate the effect of such dynamics on the resulting emission rates using conventional deterministic causal models. In view of this, a simple semi-empirical box model based on the 'traffic flow rate', is demonstrated in the present study for estimating the hourly average carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations on a 1-week data at one of the busiest traffic intersections in Delhi. The index of agreement for a whole week, was found to be 0.84, suggesting that the semi-empirical model is 84% error free. A value of 0.87 was found for weekdays and 0.75 for weekend days. The correlation coefficient for the whole week was found to be 0.75, with 0.78 for the weekdays and 0.62 for the weekend days. The RMSE and RRMSE were found to be 1.87% and 41% for a whole week, with 1.81% and 39.93% for the weekdays and 2.0% and 43.47% for the weekend days, respectively. Specific vehicle emission rates are optimized in this study for individual vehicle category, which may be useful in assessing their impacts on the air quality when there is a significant change in a specific vehicular population and the traffic pattern.

These models can reproduce some realistic phenomena which are absent in the original NS model. But in these models, the size of cluster is still not considered as a useful parameter. In real traffic, the slow-to-start motion of a standing vehicle often depends on the degree of congestion which can be measured by the clusters' size. According to this idea, we propose a cluster-size dependent slow-to-start model based on the speed-dependent slow-to-start rule (VDR) model. It gives expected results through simulations. Comparing with the VDR model, our new model has a better traffic efficiency and shows richer complex characters.

Estimation of the minimum integration time for determining the equivalent continuous sound level with a given level of uncertainty considering some statistical hypotheses for road traffic	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article							NOISE; MODEL; PARAMETERS	In this work a relation is obtained for calculating the minimum time necessary for measuring the hourly equivalent level, with preset uncertainty on the L-eq in the case of noise produced by road traffic under different statistical hypotheses for vehicular flow. A simple equivalent level prediction model is used as reference. Some specific relations between acoustic power and vehicle speed are implemented in this model. Through the application of the classic theory of errors, the expression for the uncertainty on the L-eq is obtained with reference, in particular, to various vehicle distributions: uniform (rectangular), triangular, normal and Poisson that, according to the available information, can be applied for describing traffic flow. Uncertainties over the distance source/receiver and speed of the vehicles are also taken into consideration in the calculation of uncertainty on L-eq. The minimum measurement time is obtained from the expression of the error associated with the L-eq, according to the hourly number of vehicles, so that the uncertainty on the L-eq stays within a preset value. In this case too, the determination of the minimum time refers to the various previously mentioned hypotheses with respect to vehicle distribution. It is shown that it is possible to obtain a correct description of road traffic noise, within a predetermined uncertainty on the hourly L-eq, by measuring over times considerably shorter than an hour.

Modeling highway-traffic headway distributions using superstatistics	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							RANDOM-MATRIX THEORY; GAP-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; PARKED CARS; FLOW; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS; STATES	We study traffic clearance distributions (i.e., the instantaneous gap between successive vehicles) and time-headway distributions by applying the Beck and Cohen superstatistics. We model the transition from free phase to congested phase with the increase of vehicle density as a transition from the Poisson statistics to that of the random-matrix theory. We derive an analytic expression for the spacing distributions that interpolates from the Poisson distribution and Wigner's surmise and apply it to the distributions of the net distance and time gaps among the succeeding cars at different densities of traffic flow. The obtained distribution fits the experimental results for single-vehicle data of the Dutch freeway A9 and the German freeway A5.

J	Li, Y; McDonald, M				Li, Y.; McDonald, M.			Determining the sample size of probe vehicles	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						information technology/traffic; engineering/transport management		Probe vehicles have been used to collect travel time for a number of years. Because the number of probe vehicles in a traffic stream can have a substantial effect on the accuracy of a travel time estimate, many studies have been conducted to study the required sample size of probe vehicles required for reliable travel time measurement. This paper addresses determining the sample size of probe vehicles in different traffic conditions on motorways. Travel time data from individual vehicles collected on seven motorway links were used to analyse the statistical characteristics of travel times. The relationship between mean travel time and standard deviation together with sampling theory has been used to calculate required probe vehicle sample sizes. The results indicate that fewer probe vehicles are required in more congested traffic condition while more probe vehicles are needed in lighter traffic condition. The relationship between traffic flow and the required sample size of probe vehicles can be described by a power regression equation.

Factors influencing particle number concentrations, size distributions and modal parameters at a roof-level and roadside site in Leicester, UK	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						particle number concentration; modal parameters; nucleation mode; Aitken mode; traffic emissions; wind speed	SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL; PARTICULATE MATTER; EMISSION FACTORS; GAS-PHASE; URBAN; PHOTOOXIDATION; NANOPARTICLES; OZONOLYSIS; ATMOSPHERE; STREET	Measurements of urban particle number concentrations and size distributions in the range 5-1000 nm were taken at elevated (roof-level) and roadside sampling sites on Narborough Road in Leicester, UK, along with simultaneous measurements of traffic, NOx, CO and 1,3-butadiene concentrations and meteorological parameters. A fitting program was used to determine the characteristics of up to five modal groups present in the particle size distributions. All particle modal concentrations peaked during the morning and evening rush hours. Additional events associated with the smallest mode, that were not observed to be connected to primary emissions, were also present suggesting that this mode consisted of newly formed secondary particles. These events included peaks in concentration which coincided with peaks in solar radiation, and lower concentrations of the larger modes. Investigation into the relationships between traffic flow and occupancy indicated three flow regimes; free-flow, unstable and congested. During free-flow conditions, positive linear relationships existed between traffic flow and particle modal number concentrations. However, during unstable and congested periods, this relationship was shown to break-down. Similar trends were observed for concentrations of the gas phase pollutants NOx, CO and 1,3-butadiene. Strong linear relationships existed between NOx CO, 1,3-butadiene concentrations, nucleation and Aitken mode concentrations at both sampling locations, indicating a local traffic related emission source. At the roadside, both nucleation and Aitken mode are best represented by a decreasing exponential function with wind speed, whereas at the roof-level this relationship only occurred for Aitken mode particles. The differing relationships at the two sampling locations are most likely due to a combination of meteorological factors and distance from the local emission source. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

J	Sheu, JB				Sheu, Jiuh-Biing			Microscopic modeling and control logic for incident-responsive automatic vehicle movements in single-automated-lane highway systems	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						traffic; microscopic modeling; automatic-control vehicles; incident-responsive	REAL-TIME PREDICTION	Automatic response to lane-blocking incidents is a critical issue in the field of automated highway systems (AHS). Accordingly, this paper presents a microscopic vehicular control methodology for automatic-control (AC) vehicular movements in response to lane-blocking incidents in the AHS environment. The embedded traffic control logic is based on the basic safety requirements for automatic-control lane traffic maneuvers responding to lane-blocking incidents in the single-automated-lane AHS environment. Accordingly, respective automated vehicular control models are proposed to deal with AC vehicles moving in three corresponding sequential phases, i.e., (1) AC platoon approaching the incident site from the blocked lane, (2) mandatory lane changing and mixed car following in the adjacent lane, and (3) AC platoon reforming downstream from the incident site in the blocked automated lane. Using a microscopic simulation model which embeds these proposed models, preliminary tests are conducted to investigate the relative performance of the proposed method in various traffic flow and control scenarios. The resulting numerical results, including simplified sensitivity analyses, indicate that the proposed microscopic traffic control logic permits regulating automatic-control vehicular movements in response to the effects of lane-blocking incidents on traffic flows either in control-free lanes or in the automatic-control lanes. Implications of the results and some findings are discussed for further research, (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yue, H; Hao, H; Chen, X; Shao, C				Yue, Hao; Hao, Herul; Chen, Xiaoming; Shao, Chunfu			Simulation of pedestrian flow on square lattice based on cellular automata model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						cellular automata; pedestrian flow; dynamic parameters	TRAFFIC-FLOW; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; JAMMING TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; MOVEMENT; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS	Simulations of two-way and four-way pedestrian flow on the square lattice for small systems will be presented based on cellular automata (CA) in this paper. For the reason that the decision-making process of pedestrians in their movements is complex and intelligent, pedestrian movement is more flexible and adaptive to dynamic conditions than vehicular flow. First, a special technique will be introduced to simplify tactically the process into the interaction of four dynamic parameters, which can reflect the pedestrian judgment on the surrounding conditions and decide the pedestrian's choice of action such as moving ahead, stopping to wait, position exchange, lane switching, back stepping, etc. Second, the simulation method and the relationships of velocity-density and flow-density will be studied and analyzed. It is found that there are phase transitions at the critical density point and at different phases the relationships of velocity-density and flow-density are different from each other. Moreover, the different weight coefficients of four dynamic parameters affect the simulation results of these two models. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this model, we consider the driver prejudgment according to the state of the leading car. We also consider that the vehicle deceleration capability is finite and the braking distance of the high-speed running cars cannot be ignored, which is not considered in most models. Further-more, comfortable driving is considered, too. Using computer simulations we obtain so-me basic qualitative results and the fundamental diagram of the proposed model. In comparison with the known models, we End that the fundamental diagram of the proposed model is more realistic than that of the known models.

First, such functionals are optimized for two simple networks that consist of a single junction: one with two incoming and one outgoing roads (junctions of 2 x 1 type), and the other with one incoming and two outgoing roads (junctions of 1 x 2 type). The optimization is made with respect to right of way parameters and traffic distribution coefficients, obtaining an explicit solution. Then, through simulations, the traffic behavior for complex networks is studied. The main result is that the local optimization ensures a very good result also for the complete network. This is shown by the case study of Re di Roma Square, a big traffic circle of the urban network of Rome.

First, a dynamic node model (DNM) is set out to compute the time-varying traffic flows conflicting at the node. The presented DNM has two components: a link model set with a linear travel time function and an algorithm written with a set of node rules considering the constraints of conservation, flow splitting rates and non-negativity. Each of the selected NN methods, feed-forward back-propagation NN, radial basis function NN, and generalized regression NN, are utilized one by one in the NN approximator that is integrated with the proposed DNM, and, hence, three DNL processes are simulated. Delays forming as a result of capacity constraint and flow conflicting at the node are calculated with selected NN configurations after calibrating the NN component with conical delay function formulation. The results of the model structure, run solely with the conventional delay function, are then compared to evaluate the performance of the models supported with NNs relatively. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Phase transitions in a cellular automaton model of a highway on-ramp	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION PROCESS; SPONTANEOUS SYMMETRY-BREAKING; EXACT STATIONARY STATE; TRAFFIC FLOW; DIAGRAM	We introduce a lattice gas model for the merging of two single-lane automobile highways. The merging rules for traffic on the two lanes are deterministic, but the inflow on both lanes is stochastic. Analysing the stationary distribution of this stochastic cellular automaton, we find a discontinuous phase transition from a free-flow phase which depends on the initial state of the road to a jammed phase where all memory of the initial state is lost. Inside the jammed phase we identify dynamical phase transitions in the approach to stationarity. Each dynamical phase is characterized by a fixed number of relaxation cycles which is decreasing as one moves deeper into the jammed phase. In each cycle step, the number of 'desperate' drivers who force their way onto the main road when they reach the end of the on-ramp increases until stationarity.

J	Johnston, L; Peace, V				Johnston, Lucy; Peace, Victoria			Where did that car come from?: Crossing the road when the traffic comes from an unfamiliar direction	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						pedestrian road crossing; virtual reality	VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT; RISK-TAKING; ADOLESCENTS; SIMULATIONS; PERCEPTION; TIME	Using a virtual road crossing environment, the reported research investigated the road crossing behavior of 12 male pedestrians in familiar and unfamiliar environments. Environment familiarity was manipulated using traffic direction. Seven of the participants were from a country where traffic flows from right to left and five were from countries were traffic flows from left to right. Each participant was asked to cross the road when traffic was coming from both the familiar and the unfamiliar direction for them. Results showed that pedestrians had lower safety ration, or a lower margin of error, in crossing the road when traffic was flowing in an unfamiliar direction, suggesting that pedestrians might be at greater risk of accident in such environments. Implications of these findings are discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The proposed protocol autonomously changes the dissemination interval, depending on the number of reception messages and detected reception errors, in order to avoid message collision among vehicles. We have constructed a realistic simulation environment of intervehicle communication by combining a traffic-flow simulator and an ad hoc network simulator. Our simulation results show that, by using RMDP, a lot of vehicles can acquire their preceding traffic information within short periods at both the conditions with light and heavy traffic. In addition, we have also shown that selection policy of disseminated data affects preceding-traffic-information acquisition time. Each vehicle holds other vehicles' traces for some period. Depending on the number of preserved other vehicles' traces and their preserved periods, the propagation ratio of the preceding traffic information varies. Some simulation results are explained.

J	Artimy, M				Artimy, Maen			Local density estimation and dynamic transmission-range assignment in vehicular ad hoc networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Ad hoc networks; connectivity; density estimation; inter-vehicle communications; transmission range; vehicular ad hoc networks	TOPOLOGY-CONTROL; TRAFFIC FLOW; CONNECTIVITY; CHALLENGES	Vehicular ad hoc networks have several characteristics that distinguish them from other ad hoc networks. Among those is the rapid change in topology due to traffic jams, which also disturbs the homogeneous distribution of vehicles on the road. For this reason, a dynamic transmission range is more effective in maintaining the connectivity while minimizing the adverse effects of a high transmission power. This paper proposes a scheme that allows vehicles to estimate the local density and distinguish between the free-flow and the congested traffic phases. The density estimate is used to develop a dynamic transmission-range-assignment (DTRA) algorithm that sets a vehicle transmission range dynamically according to the local traffic conditions. Simulations of several road configurations validate the quality of the local density estimation and show that the DTRA algorithm is successful in maintaining the connectivity in highly dynamic networks.

J	Sarvi, M; Kuwahara, M				Sarvi, Majid; Kuwahara, Masao			Microsimulation of freeway ramp merging processes under congested traffic conditions	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						congested traffic flow; driving behavior; freeway ramp merging; microsimulation	CAPACITY	This paper describes a microsimulation program developed to study freeway ramp merging phenomena under congested traffic conditions. The results of extensive macroscopic and microscopic studies are used to establish a model for the behavior of merging drivers. A theoretical framework for modeling the ramp and freeway lag driver acceleration-deceleration behavior guided the model development. This methodology uses the stimuli-response psychophysical concept as a fundamental rule and is formulated as a modified form of the conventional car-following models. Data collected at the two merging points are used to calibrate the hypothesized ramp and freeway lag vehicle acceleration models. Drawing on this behavioral model, the Freeway Merging Capacity Simulation Program (FMCSP) is developed to simulate actual traffic conditions. This model evaluates the capacity of a merging section for a given geometric design and flow condition. Validation of FMCSP is performed using the observed flow, vehicle trajectories, and lane-changing maneuvers. The simulation model is applied to investigate a variety of merging strategies. The results indicated that the FMCSP is capable of simulating the actual traffic conditions of congested freeway ramp merging sections and will aid in the development of traffic management strategies for complex freeway ramp merging areas.

We consider a fluid dynamic model based on conservation laws. The dynamics at nodes is solved by FIFO policy combined with through flux maximization. We first link the dimension of the equilibria space to topological properties of the graph associated to the network. Then we focus on regular plane tilings with square or triangular cells. For various networks, we completely determine the characteristics of periodic equilibria and, in some cases, of all equilibria. The obtained results are expected to play a role both in the analysis of asymptotic behavior of network load and for security issues in case of node failures.

J	Ferrara, A; Vecchio, C				Ferrara, Antonella; Vecchio, Claudio			Collision avoidance strategies and coordinated control of passenger vehicles	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						automated guided vehicles; cruise control; collision avoidance; sliding mode control; vehicle dynamics; Antonella Ferrara	STRING STABILITY	Recent research has demonstrated the efficaciousness of the coordinated control of platoons of vehicles in order to homogenize the traffic flows and improve the exploitation of the capacity of road networks. Yet, taking into account the necessity of reducing, in the next years, the number of accidents involving pedestrians or other vulnerable road users (VRUs), like cyclists and motorcyclists, it seems useful to provide the control systems of the vehicles of the platoon with some collision detection and avoidance capability. This issue is investigated in this paper. The control system presented in this paper allows to maintain cruise conditions, and, as a novelty with respect to consolidated proposals, to avoid the collision with possible VRUs present on the road. The proposed control system is realized by means of vehicle supervisors, which, on the basis of the data acquired by the sensors, make the decision on which is the appropriate current control mode for each controlled vehicle, and manage the switches among low-level controllers. These are designed relying on a simple bicycle model, and according to a sliding mode control methodology. This choice is motivated by the robustness features of the sliding mode design, which appears particularly appropriate dealing with the automotive context.

J	Wang, YB; Papageorgiou, M; Messmer, A				Wang, Yibing; Papageorgiou, Markos; Messmer, Albert			Investigation of the adaptive features of a real-time nonlinear freeway traffic state estimator	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						stochastic macroscopic traffic flow model; extended Kalman filter; freeway traffic state estimation; on-line model parameter estimation; congestion; traffic incidents	FLOW	This paper reports on real-data testing results for a real-time nonlinear freeway traffic state estimator with particular focus on its adaptive features. The pursued general approach to the real-time adaptive estimation of the complete traffic state in freeway stretches is based on stochastic nonlinear macroscopic traffic flow modeling and extended Kalman filtering that are outlined in the paper. One major innovative aspect of the estimator is the on-line estimation of important model parameters (free speed, critical density, and capacity) simultaneously with the estimation of traffic flow variables (flows, mean speeds, and densities), which leads to three significant advantages of the traffic state estimator: (1) avoidance of off-line model calibration; (2) automatic adaptation to changing external conditions (e.g. weather and light conditions); (3) enabling of incident alarms. The purpose of the reported real-data testing is, first, to demonstrate advantage (1) by investigating some basic properties of the estimator and, second, to explore some adaptive capabilities of the estimator that enable the other two advantages. The achieved testing results are quite satisfactory and promising for subsequent work.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Hiller, A				Kerner, Boris S.; Klenov, Sergey L.; Hiller, Andreas			Empirical test of a microscopic three-phase traffic theory	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						Kerner's three-phase traffic theory; methodology for empirical test of traffic flow models; nonlinear dynamics of freeway traffic; spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns; synchronized flow; wide moving jam	SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; SINGLE-VEHICLE DATA; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; METASTABLE STATES; MODEL; FLOW; PHYSICS	A review of dynamic nonlinear features of spatiotemporal congested patterns in freeway traffic is presented. The basis of the review is a comparison of theoretical features of the congested patterns that are shown by a microscopic traffic flow model in the context of the Kerner's three-phase traffic theory and empirical microscopic and macroscopic pattern characteristics measured on different freeways over various days and years. In this test of the microscopic three-phase traffic flow theory, a model of an "open" road is applied: Empirical time-dependence of traffic demand and drivers' destinations are used at the upstream model boundaries. At downstream model boundary conditions for vehicle freely leaving a modeling freeway section(s) are given. Spatiotemporal congested patterns emerge, develop, and dissolve in this open freeway model with the same types of bottlenecks as those in empirical observations. It is found that microscopic three-phase traffic models can explain all known macroscopic and microscopic empirical congested pattern features (e.g., probabilistic breakdown phenomenon as a first-order phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow, moving jam emergence in synchronized flow rather than in free flow, spatiotemporal features of synchronized flow and general congested patterns at freeway bottlenecks, intensification of downstream congestion due to upstream congestion at adjacent bottlenecks). It turns out that microscopic optimal velocity (OV) functions and time headway distributions are not necessarily qualitatively different, even if local congested traffic behavior is qualitatively different. Model performance with respect to spatiotemporal pattern emergence and evolution cannot be tested using these traffic characteristics. The reason for this is that important spatiotemporal features of congested traffic patterns are lost in these and many other macroscopic and microscopic traffic characteristics, which are widely used as the empirical basis for a test of traffic flow models.

F. Daganzo, Transportation Research, Part B, 28B(4),269-287, 1994. Elsevier is presented. The scheme is intended for use with on-ramp metering control algorithms, providing local knowledge of densities and velocities that is helpful to improve on-ramp metering control performance. Estimation of density is obtained by nonlinear estimators, while velocity estimation is obtained by gradient algorithms. There is one density-velocity estimator for free traffic flow and other for congested traffic flow. Both estimator schemes work in parallel. The final estimation of density and velocity results from a convex combination of the predictions of the two estimators. This combination depends on occupancy or density measurements at the boundaries of the stretch and is produced by a fuzzy inference system. Stability and convergence of the density and velocity estimation scheme is proved by Lyapunov based techniques. Simulation results comparing measured and estimated traffic data are presented. They confirm good performance of the estimators.

Simulation and dynamics of freeway traffic	NONLINEAR DYNAMICS			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; simulation and modelling; traffic control; traffic dynamics		This paper presents the new package entitled Simulator of Intelligent Transportation Systems (SITS) and a computational oriented analysis of traffic dynamics. The SITS adopts a microscopic simulation approach to reproduce real traffic conditions considering different types of vehicles, drivers and roads. A set of experiments with the SITS reveal the dynamic phenomena exhibited by this kind of system. For this purpose a modelling formalism is developed that embeds the statistics and the Laplace transform. The results make possible the adoption of classical system theory tools and point out that it is possible to study traffic systems taking advantage of the knowledge gathered with automatic control algorithms. A complementary perspective for the analysis of the traffic flow is also quantified through the entropy measure.

Hybridization of a class of "second order" models of traffic flow	SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY			English	Article						traffic flow; hybrid model; macroscopic model; microscopic model; mesoscopic model; eulerian; lagrangian		Despite the simultaneous progress of traffic modelling both on the macroscopic and microscopic front, recent works [E. Bourrel, J.B. Lessort, Mixing micro and macro representation of traffic flow: a hybrid model based on the LWR theory, Transport. Res. Rec. 1852 (2003) 193-200; D. Helbing, M. Treiber, Critical discussion of "synchronized flow", Coop. Transport. Dyn. 1 (2002) 2.1-2.24; A. Hennecke, M. Treiber, D. Helbing, Macroscopic simulations of open systems and micro-macro link, in: D. Helbing, H.J. Herrmann, M. Schreckenberg, D.E. Wolf (Eds.), Traffic and Granular Flow '99, Springer, Berlin, 2000, pp. 383-388] highlighted that one of the most promising way to simulate efficiently traffic flow on large road networks is a clever combination of both traffic representations: the hybrid modelling. Our focus in this paper is to propose two hybrid models for which the macroscopic (resp. mesoscopic) part is based on a class of second order model [A. Aw, M. Rascle, Resurection of second order models of traffic flow?, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 60 (2000) 916938] whereas the microscopic part is a Follow-the Leader type model [D.C. Gazis, R. Herman, R.W. Rothery, Nonlinear follow-the-leader models of traffic flow, Oper. Res. 9 (1961) 545-567; R. Herman, I. Prigogine, Kinetic Theory of Vehicular Traffic, American Elsevier, New York, 1971]. For the first hybrid model, we define precisely the translation of boundary conditions at interfaces and for the second one we explain the synchronization processes.

Based on the present model and the theory of feedback control, the stability criteria are given for the change of speed of the lead vehicle. The theoretical analysis shows that the information on more leading vehicles of each vehicle could lead to a stabilization effect for the traffic flow,that is,the stability conditions could be considerably weakened. The corresponding numerical simulations confirm the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Through comparing the present results with those in previous works, it is concluded that the proposed control strategy is more effective in suppressing the formation of traffic congestion by applying and controlling the induction information provided by the intelligent transportation system.

EXPANSION METHOD; NETWORKS; INTERSECTIONS; DISTRIBUTIONS; SIMULATION; HIGHWAY; LENGTH	In this paper, an overview of different analytic queueing models for traffic on road networks is presented. In the literature, it has been shown that queueing models can be used to adequately model uninterrupted traffic flows. This paper gives a broad review on this literature. Moreover, it is shown that the developed published methodologies (which are mainly single node oriented) can be extended towards queueing networks. First, an extension towards queueing networks with infinite buffer sizes is evaluated. Secondly, the assumption of infinite buffer sizes is dropped leading to queueing networks with finite buffer sizes. The impact of the buffer size when comparing the different queueing network methodologies is studied in detail. The paper ends with an analytical application tool to facilitate the optimal positioning of the counting points on a highway.

A short-time rolling forecasting method for traffic flow was proposed. This method used an RBF neural network to establish a forecasting baseline and the residual errors were achieved. The fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to divide the residual errors into different fuzzy states for fuzzy Markov chains and state centers were obtained. Then fuzzy state transition probability matrices were calculated. Subsequently, the state transition was analyzed to determine the most possible state of the forecasting value, and then the corresponding state center was used to revise the forecasting value to achieve a more accurate one. Meanwhile, the real-time rolling forecasting mechanism for traffic flow was realized. Using this method to conduct a simulation experiment on real data, the results demonstrate that this method is superior to the general RBF neural networks in precision and has good adaptability to the dynamic traffic flow environment.

This kind of algorithm first divided one day into several control segment domain according to traffic flow vibration trend curve, then it defined the proper weight adjusting the significance coefficient of different input variables, and last, it built different segment fuzzy query chart. In practice, the controller could choose the proper chart to control system on current time. The simulation results show that the new algorithm could improve traffic performance index effectively. In general, the average stop is decreased by 2.1%, average speed is increased by 1.07%,and average delay is decreased by 1.3%,and traffic volume is increased by 10.2%.

In this study it is shown that the replacement of a classical road intersection by a roundabout, under certain conditions, may produce a traffic noise decrease. These conditions are expressed in terms of the roundabout speed and the receiver location. The A-weighted sound exposure level is used to describe noise reduction.

Relative risks of hospitalization for childhood asthma during the postAsian Game period compared with the baseline.period were estimated using a time-series analysis of the generalized additive Poisson model. Fourteen consecutive days of traffic volume control in Busan during the Games reduced all regulated air pollutant levels by 1-25%. The estimated relative risk of hospitalization during the postGames period over the baseline period was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.49, 1.11). We observed that this reduced air pollution was unique in 2002 when the traffic volume reduction program was applied during the Games period. This empirical data provides epidemiologic evidence of the health benefits resulting from environmental interventions to reduce ambient air pollution.

J	Stewart, K				Stewart, Kathryn			Tolling traffic links under stochastic assignment: Modelling the relationship between the number and price level of tolled links and optimal traffic flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on the Success and Failure of Travel Management Measures	AUG, 2005	Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst, Edinburgh, SCOTLAND		Napier Univ, Transport Res Inst	congestion charging; traffic assignment; stochastic user equilibrium; optimal tolls; marginal social costs	USER EQUILIBRIUM; CONGESTION; ALGORITHM	The classical road-tolling problem is to toll network links such that under the principles of Wardropian User Equilibrium Assignment a System Optimising (SO) flow pattern is obtained. Stochastic assignment methods are accepted to be more realistic than deterministic and it is of interest to examine the potential for optimal tolling in the case of Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE). In examining the case of Stochastic User Equilibrium the 'desired flow pattern' to be created must first be determined. The classical economics solution of replacing unit-cost flow functions with marginal-cost flow functions which under deterministic assignment produces the System Optimal solution (where Total Network Travel Cost (TNTC) is minimised) does not generally result in TNTC being minimised in the Stochastic Case. Instead such tolls produce a 'Stochastic System Optimal' (SSO) solution where the Total Perceived Network Travel Cost (TPNTC) is minimised. This paper examines and compares link-based tolling solutions to achieve both the SSO (TPNTC minimised) and true SO (TNTC minimised) under SUE and illustrates the concept with numerical examples. Such link-based tolling schemes produce network benefit by re-routing rather than traffic suppression as opposed to the cordon-based charging schemes which have been implemented in practice. Equity issues relating to charging schemes are discussed and the desirability of zero-toll routes is highlighted associated with greater potential political acceptability of charging schemes that do not impose excessive charges upon users (such as minimal or low revenue tolls). A heuristic is developed to toll network links in such a way as to balance the number of links tolled against the revenue required to produce a desired reduction in TNTC such that optimal network flow patterns are approached.

J	Leclercq, L				Leclercq, Ludovic			Hybrid approaches to the solutions of the "Lighthill-Whitham-Richards" model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						kinematic wave (LWR) model; macroscopic and microscopic resolution; coupling conditions; macro/micro and micro/macro interfaces	TRAFFIC FLOW; KINEMATIC WAVES	This paper presents a hybrid "Lighthill-Whitham-Richards" (LWR) model combining both macroscopic and microscopic traffic descriptions. Simple interfaces are defined to translate the boundary conditions when changing the traffic description. They are located in discrete points in space and are based on a generalisation of demand and supply concepts. Simulation results show that the proposed interfaces ensure an accurate wave propagation along two links differently described. Furthermore, the demand and supply formulation of the hybrid model makes it fully compatible with major LWR extensions developed over the past few years (intersections modeling, multi-lanes representation, etc.). Finally, we prove that Newell's optimal velocity car-following model can be derived from the Godunov scheme applied to the LWR model in Lagrangian coordinates. This proposes a microscopic resolution of the LWR model that is fully compatible with the usual macroscopic representation. This microscopic resolution is included in the hybrid model.

Resurrection of second order models of traffic flow. SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics 60 (3), 916938] and [Zhang, H.M., 2002. A non-equilibrium traffic model devoid of gas-like behavior. Transportation Research Part B 36, 275-290]. These models were suggested after the publication of an article written by [Daganzo, C.F., 1995. Requiem for second-order fluid approximations of traffic flow. Transportation Research Part B 29, 277-286] showing that some classical second-order models can exhibit non-physical solutions. It is shown in this note that the ARZ (Aw-Rascle-Zhang) model respects the anisotropic character of traffic flow, that it yields physical solutions, and that vacuum problems can be solved satisfactorily, provided that the fundamental diagram (equilibrium speed-density relationship) is extended in a suitable fashion. It follows that the Riemann problem for the ARZ model with extended fundamental diagram always admits a solution, and that this solution depends continuously on the initial conditions.

J	Gunay, B				Gunay, Banihan			Car following theory with lateral discomfort	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						car following; lane discipline; lane-based driving; lateral position of traffic		A car following model has been developed with particular reference to weak discipline of lane-based driving. The theory is based on the discomfort caused by lateral friction between vehicles. The movement of the following vehicle was formulated as a function of the off-centre effects of its leader(s). This incorporation of lateral friction offers a potential breakthrough in the fields of car following theory and microscopic simulation of traffic flow. Using a stopping-distance car following approach, the simulation presented in the paper pointed out the effect of the travel path width on the speed of the following vehicle, and the reduced following distance with increased lateral separation between the leader and follower. It was also shown that a special case of the proposed model (i.e. when the maximum escape speed is zero) produced the same results as the base model did for the conventional car following case. The simulation behaved rationally giving credibility to the author's staggered car following theory. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

No traffic lights control the traffic flow. The approaching cars to the intersection yield to each other to avoid collision. Closed boundary condition is applied to the streets. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation is taken into account to find the model characteristics. In particular, we obtain the fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of the interaction of two streets can be regarded as a dynamic impurity located at the intersection point. Our results suggest that yielding mechanism gives rise to a high total flow throughout the intersection especially in the low density regime.

J	Caliendo, C; Guida, M; Parisi, A				Caliendo, Ciro; Guida, Maurizio; Parisi, Alessandra			A crash-prediction model for multilane roads	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						crash-prediction model; multilane road; negative multinormal distribution; traffic flow; road geometry; pavement friction; weather	REGRESSION-MODELS; TRAFFIC FLOW; ACCIDENT; WEATHER; OVERDISPERSION; SEVERITY; NETWORKS; RAINFALL; POISSON	Considerable research has been carried out in recent years to establish relationships between crashes and traffic flow, geometric infrastructure characteristics and environmental factors for two-lane rural roads. Crash-prediction models focused on multilane rural roads, however, have rarely been investigated. In addition, most research has paid but little attention to the safety effects of variables such as stopping sight distance and pavement surface characteristics. Moreover, the statistical approaches have generally included Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, whilst Negative Multinomial regression model has been used to a lesser extent. Finally, as far as the authors are aware, prediction models involving all the above-mentioned factors have still not been developed in Italy for multilane roads, such as motorways. Thus, in this paper crash-prediction models for a four-lane median-divided Italian motorway were set up on the basis of accident data observed during a 5-year monitoring period extending between 1999 and 2003. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Negative Multinomial regression models, applied separately to tangents and curves, were used to model the frequency of accident occurrence. Model parameters were estimated by the Maximum Likelihood Method, and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test was applied to detect the significant variables to be included in the model equation. Goodness-of-fit was measured by means of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained fraction of systematic variation. The Cumulative Residuals Method was also used to test the adequacy of a regression model throughout the range of each variable. The candidate set of explanatory variables was: length (L). curvature (1/R), annual average daily traffic (AADT), sight distance (SD), side friction coefficient (SFC), longitudinal slope (LS) and the presence of a junction (J). Separate prediction models for total crashes and for fatal and injury crashes only were considered. For curves it is shown that significant variables are L, 1/R and AADT, whereas for tangents they are L, AADT and junctions. The effect of rain precipitation was analysed on the basis of hourly rainfall data and assumptions about drying time. It is shown that a wet pavement significantly increases the number of crashes. The models developed in this paper for Italian motorways appear to be useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors, the estimation of accident reduction due to infrastructure and pavement improvement, and the predictions of accidents counts when comparing different design options. Thus this research may represent a point of reference for engineers in adjusting or designing multilane roads. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Vehicle emissions were estimated from the measured traffic flow rates and modeled as banded line sources along the tunnel floor. The effects of fan ventilation and piston effect of moving vehicles on the airflow and pollutant dilution were examined. The numerical results reveal that a peak velocity exists near the tunnel floor due to the piston effect of vehicles. The cross-sectional concentrations of air pollutants are non-uniformly distributed and concentrations rise with downstream distance. The piston effect of vehicles can alone provide 25%-34% dilution of air pollutants in the tunnel, compounded 43%-70% dilution effect according to the ventilation condition.

J	Moussa, N				Moussa, N.			Metastable states in two-lane traffic flow models with slow-to-start rule	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; LANE	Using computer simulations, we show that metastable states still occur in two-lane traffic models with slow to start rules. However, these metastable states no longer exist in systems where aggressive drivers (which do not look back before changing lanes) are present. Indeed, the presence of only one aggressive driver in the circuit, triggers the breakdown of the high flow states. In these systems, the steady state is unique and its relaxation dynamics should depend on the lane changing probability p(ch) and the number of aggressive drivers present in the circuit. It is found also that the relaxation time tau diverges as the form of a power-law: tau alpha p(ch)(-beta), beta=1.

J	Meng, JP; Dai, SQ; Dong, LY; Zhang, JF				Meng, Jian-ping; Dai, Shi-qiang; Dong, Li-yun; Zhang, Jie-fang			Cellular automaton model for mixed traffic flow with motorcycles	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						mixed traffic flow; cellular automaton model; motorcycles	RULES; VEHICLES; HIGHWAY; SYSTEMS	A single-lane cellular automaton model is proposed to simulate mixed traffic with motorcycles. By performing numerical simulations under the periodic boundary condition, some density-flow relations and the "lane-changing" behavior of motorcycles are investigated in detail. It is found that the maximum car flow decreases because of the "lane-changing" behavior of motorcycles. The maximum total flow increases first and then decreases with increasing motorcycle density. Moreover, the transition of the total flow from the free flow to the congested flow is smooth in this model. The "lane-changing" rate of motorcycles will decrease to zero finally with the increase of the car density. But its evolutionary trend is considerably complex. Another interesting fact is that, with the increase of the motorcycle density, the "lane-changing" rate increases first and decreases later. This phenomenon is very similar to the findings in other papers on multi-lane car flows. The "lane-changing" is almost of no use in increasing the flow of motorcycles as the motorcycle density is small. But it distinctly causes the increase in the flow of motorcycles when the motorcycle density is sufficiently large, and in this density regime, the flow of motorcycles gradually decreases to the one given with the Nagel-Schreckenberg model for motorcycles with the increase of the car density.

Interactions of waves in the speed-gradient traffic flow model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; partial differential equation; initial value problem; shock wave; smooth transition layer	CONTINUUM MODEL; PARAMETERS	In this paper, we use the speed-gradient (SG) model proposed by Jiang et al. [Transportation Research Part B, 36 (2002) 405-419] to study the initial value problem of traffic flow. The evolution of multi-traffic waves is examined through setting piecewise continuous initial density. Numerical results show that distinct shocks and smooth transition layers appear instantaneously for some initial densities, and the shock front is smoothed by the smooth transition layer ahead of or behind it if, in the initial density, the length of shock section or the length of lower-density section before the shock is very short. We thus verify that the SG model can satisfyingly reproduce the evolution of multi-traffic waves with various initial densities. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although this self-questioning mechanism does not show much advantages in sustaining the cooperative behavior comparing to the existing models, it can produce interesting non-monotonic phenomena in numerical simulations. Furthermore, this new model has avoided the system from being enmeshed in a globally defective trap, which is a shortcoming of the existing models based on the learning mechanisms. It is found that in certain cases, the so called "Cooperative Ping-pong Effect" occurs in both the two games and plays an important role in the behaviors of the whole system. This new model shows non-trivial characters comparing to the previous work and is worthy of further studies. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We show that the microscopic structure of traffic flow is dependent on its initial state by plotting the fraction of congested vehicles over the density, which shows a typical hysteresis loop, and by investigating the trajectories of vehicles on the velocity-over-headway plane. We find that the trajectories of vehicles on the velocity-over-headway plane, which usually show a hysteresis loop, include multiple loops. We also point out the relations between these hysteresis loops and the congested jams or high-density clusters in traffic flow.

DRONE involves integrating a road traffic noise estimation model with a traffic simulator to estimate road traffic noise in urban networks. An integrated traffic simulation-noise estimation model provides an interface for direct input of traffic flow properties from simulation model to noise estimation model that in turn estimates the noise on a spatial and temporal scale. The output from DRONE is linked with a geographical information system for visual representation of noise levels in the form of noise contour maps. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kilpelainen, M; Summala, H				Kilpelainen, Markku; Summala, Heikki			Effects of weather and weather forecasts on driver behaviour	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART F-TRAFFIC PSYCHOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Conference on Traffic and Transport Psychology	SEP 05-09, 2004	Nottingham, ENGLAND			weather; weather forecasts; driver behaviour; darkness; risk perception; road conditions; expert system; driving speed	TRAFFIC ACCIDENT RISK; ROAD; SLIPPERINESS; SYSTEM; SNOW	Winter-time slipperiness is a considerable source of elevated road accident risk, especially in northern countries such as Canada, Finland and Sweden. The national road administrations often offer a service to inform drivers of forthcoming weather and driving conditions in different regions. This study addressed the effects of adverse weather and traffic weather forecasts on driver behaviour in Finland. Drivers (n = 1437) answered a questionnaire on perceptions of weather, self-reported driving behaviour, pre-trip acquisition of weather information, and possible travel plan changes. The questionnaires were distributed and instantaneously collected in rural service stations in different weather and driving conditions. Data from traffic weather forecasts, automatic traffic counters and weather measurement stations concerning the same area (and road) were also collected. Acquisition Of Weather information for the trip was associated with low recent driving experience, increasing age, female gender, long trip in question and very poor (local) conditions perceived by the driver. Drivers who had acquired information had also made more changes to travel plans, but information acquisition did not have an effect on their on-road driving behaviour. However, they estimated prevailing risks higher than those who did not acquire weather information. Drivers generally considered the driving conditions better than the forecast, but significantly less so in darkness than in daylight or civil twilight. Leisure trips were clearly underrepresented during very poor driving conditions forecasts, suggesting that some trips are postponed as a result of adverse weather conditions or forecasts thereof. Drivers reported various kinds of compensatory behaviour during adverse conditions, including a 6-7 km/h target speed decrement. This corresponded to traffic flow speed measurements. The results suggest that the on-road driving behaviour is predominantly affected by the prevailing observable conditions, rather than traffic weather forecasts. It is suggested that if administrators wish to help drivers in adjusting their on-road behaviour in adverse weather conditions, the methods should be more local and technical by nature.

In this paper, we simplify a fluidodynamic traffic model and derive a new traffic flow model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs). This is obtained by spatial discretization of an averaged density evolution and a suitable approximation of the coupling conditions at junctions of the network. We show that the new model inherits similar features of the full model, e.g., traffic jam propagation. We consider optimal control problems controlled by the ODE model and derive the optimality system. We present numerical results on the simulation and optimization of traffic flow in sample networks.

Model for rural transportation planning considering simulating mobility and traffic kills in the badger Meles meles	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						GIS land use planning; road ecology; spatially explicit models; vehicle collision; Meles meles	ROAD; POPULATIONS; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE	Large-scale spatial planning requires careful use and presentation of spatial data as it provides a means for communication with local stakeholders and decision makers. This is especially true for endangered species, such as the badger (Meles meles) in the Netherlands. To effectively mitigate the badger's traffic mortality in an area, two types of tools are needed. The first one estimates the probability of a successful road crossing for individual animals. The second tool is GIS-based and not only models the movement patterns of animals but also estimates an animal's daily number of road crossings. With data on population size as well as on road and traffic characteristics, a combination of both tools provides a measure of the mortality risk roads pose to wildlife in an area. Such estimations proved to be invaluable in a planning process with local inhabitants in the municipality of Brummen (the Netherlands), where ecological as well as safety problems appear. Our study demonstrates the applicability of GIS tools in balancing ecological consequences of road network options with a different distribution of traffic flows over the area in spatial planning and ecology.

J	Ni, DH				Ni, Daiheng			Determining traffic-flow characteristics by definition for application in ITS	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						density; Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS); space mean speed (SMS); traffic-flow characteristics	DENSITY; LANE	Traffic-flow characteristics such as flow, density, and space mean speed (SMS) are critical to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For example, flow is a direct measure of throughput, density is an ideal indicator of traffic conditions, and SMS is the primary input to compute travel times. An attractive method to compute traffic-flow characteristics in ITS is expected to meet the following criteria: 1) It should be a one-stop solution, meaning it involves only one type of sensor that is able to determine flow, SMS, and density; 2) it should be accurate, meaning it determines these characteristics by definition rather than by estimation or by using surrogates; 3) it should preserve the fundamental relationship among flow, SMS, and density; and 4) it should be compatible with ITS, meaning it uses ITS data and supports online application. Existing methods may be good for one or some of the above criteria, but none satisfies all of them. This paper tackles the challenge by formulating a method, called the n - t method, which addresses all these criteria. Its accuracy and the fundamental relationship are guaranteed by applying a generalized definition of traffic-flow characteristics. Inputs to the method are time-stamped traffic counts which happen to be the strength of most ITS systems. Some empirical examples are provided to demonstrate the performance of the n - t method.

Control of spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns at highway bottlenecks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						congested pattern control (ANCONA); critical discussion of on-ramp metering method ALINEA; empirical congested traffic patterns; feedback on-ramp metering; three-phase traffic theory; traffic breakdown at bottlenecks	FLOW; PHYSICS; MODEL	It is shown that the probabilistic feature of traffic breakdown at an on-ramp bottleneck leads to great limitations for reliable applications of a free flow control approach in which free flow should be maintained at the bottleneck. Based on these measured features of traffic breakdown at the bottleneck as well as on the Kerner-Klenov microscopic traffic model in the context of the author's three-phase traffic theory, critical discussions of earlier traffic flow models for freeway control simulations and of ALINEA methods of Papageorgiou et al. for feedback on-ramp metering are made. An alternative congested pattern control approach to feedback on-ramp metering ANCONA introduced by the author in 2004 is numerically studied. In ANCONA, congestion at the bottleneck is allowed to set in. However, ANCONA maintains speeds within a congested pattern higher than about 60 km/h and prevents upstream propagation of the pattern. To reach these goals, after traffic breakdown has occurred spontaneously at the bottleneck, ANCONA tries to return to free flow via reduction of on-ramp inflow. A critical comparison of ANCONA with ALINEA and UP-ALINEA is made.

J	Sun, SL; Zhang, CS				Sun, Shiliang; Zhang, Changshui			The selective random subspace predictor for traffic flow forecasting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						correlation coefficient; random subspace; subset selection; traffic flow forecasting		Traffic flow forecasting is an important issue for the application of Intelligent Transportation Systems. Due to practical limitations, traffic flow data may be incomplete (partially missing or substantially contaminated by noises), which will aggravate the difficulties for traffic flow forecasting. In this paper, a new approach, termed the selective random subspace predictor (SRSP), is developed, which is capable of implementing traffic flow forecasting effectively whether incomplete data exist or not. It integrates the entire spatial and temporal traffic flow information in a transportation network to carry out traffic flow forecasting. To forecast the traffic flow at an object road link, the Pearson correlation coefficient is adopted to select some candidate input variables that compose the selective input space. Then, a number of subsets of the input variables in the selective input space are randomly selected to, respectively, serve as specific inputs for prediction. The multiple outputs are combined through a fusion methodology to make final decisions. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the SRSP for traffic flow forecasting, whether for complete data or for incomplete data.

J	Umemura, K; Ebina, K				Umemura, Kaito; Ebina, Kuniyoshi			Energy dissipation burst on the traffic congestion	JOURNAL OF THE PHYSICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			English	Article						vehicular traffic flow; optimal velocity model; energy dissipation; congestion; steady state flow	FLOW; MODELS; SYSTEMS	We introduce an energy dissipation model for traffic flow based on the optimal velocity model (OV model). In this model, vehicles are defined as moving under the rule of the OV model, and energy dissipation rate is defined as the product of the velocity of a vehicle and resistant force which works to it. According to the results of numerical simulation on the periodic boundary condition, the energy dissipation depends on traffic conditions, such as congestion (traffic jam), and therefore depends on parameters and initial conditions of the system. The results of simulation indicate that, although the flux of vehicular transportation is not so different between at a state of free flow and that of congestion, the energy dissipation reveals a burst at a state of congestion. Additionally, how the burst behaves depends on how congestion appears.

The present study sets the groundwork for a methodology that can be used to selectively target corridor for BRT modeling in India. Traffic quality parameters, such as traffic flow, speed, travel time, delay time, stop time, and fuel consumption, were modeled to investigate the impact of BRT as compared to present day mixed traffic on traffic and commuter mobility. A microsimulation traffic model was developed for BRT and mixed traffic systems. A developed microscopic model was validated with field measured data using statistical methods and was found good against measured data. A dedicated lane-based public transport system shows the promising results and has to play a significant role in developing sustainable transport systems. These findings can be used to form the basis for developing public transport corridor in present Indian traffic conditions.

J	Delitala, M; Tosin, A				Delitala, Marcello; Tosin, Andrea			Mathematical modeling of vehicular traffic: A discrete kinetic theory approach	MATHEMATICAL MODELS & METHODS IN APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						traffic flow modeling; discrete kinetic theory; probabilistic interactions; table of games; interaction length	FLOW; EQUATIONS	Following some general ideas on the discrete kinetic and stochastic game theory proposed by one of the authors in a previous work, this paper develops a discrete velocity mathematical model for vehicular traffic along a one-way road. The kinetic scale is chosen because, unlike the macroscopic one, it allows to capture the probabilistic essence of the interactions among the vehicles, and offers at the same time, unlike the microscopic one, the opportunity of a pro. table analytical investigation of the relevant global features of the system. The discretization of the velocity variable, rather than being a pure mathematical technicality, plays a role in including the intrinsic granular nature of the flow of vehicles in the mathematical theory of traffic. Other important characteristics of the model concern the gain and loss terms of the kinetic equations, namely the construction of a density-dependent table of games to model velocity transitions and the introduction of a visibility length to account for nonlocal interactions among the vehicles.

Furthermore, conflicts or coordination problems of intersecting or merging flows are considered as well. Making assumptions regarding the permeability of the intersection as a function of the conflicting flows and the queue lengths, we find self-organized oscillations in the flows similar to the operation of traffic lights.

We use the dynamic model in which the normal vehicle allows to pass the slow vehicle just behind it with a probability. The fundamental diagram (flow density) changes highly by introducing a slow vehicle on a single-lane roadway. The spatio-temporal patterns are shown for the distinct traffic states. The dynamical state of traffic changes with increasing density. It is found that there are the three distinct states for the single-lane traffic flow including a slow vehicle. It is shown that the dynamical transitions among the distinct states occur at two values of density. The jamming transitions are analyzed theoretically. The transition points and fundamental diagram obtained by the theory agree with the simulation result. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, L. C.			Effect of adaptive cruise control systems on mixed traffic flow near an on-ramp	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic model; traffic flow; traffic dynamics; congested flow	MODEL; VEHICLES	Mixed traffic flow consisting of vehicles equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) and manually driven vehicles is analyzed using car-following simulations. Simulations of merging from an on-ramp onto a freeway reported in the literature have not thus far demonstrated a substantial positive impact of ACC. In this paper cooperative merging for ACC vehicles is proposed to improve throughput and increase distance traveled in a fixed time. In such a system an ACC vehicle senses not only the preceding vehicle in the same lane but also the vehicle immediately in front in the other lane. Prior to reaching the merge region, the ACC vehicle adjusts its velocity to ensure that a safe gap for merging is obtained. If on-ramp demand is moderate, cooperative merging produces significant improvement in throughput (20%) and increases up to 3.6 km in distance traveled in 600 s for 50% ACC mixed flow relative to the flow of all-manual vehicles. For large demand, it is shown that autonomous merging with cooperation in the flow of all ACC vehicles leads to throughput limited only by the downstream capacity, which is determined by speed limit and headway time.

Within a certain height from 1.5 to 20 m, the particle size distributions significantly changed with increasing height. The particle number concentrations in the nucleation mode and in the Aitken mode significantly dropped, and the peaking diameter in the Aitken mode shifted to larger sizes. The variations of the particle number size distributions in the accumulation mode were less significant than those in the nucleation and Aitken modes. The particle number size distributions slightly changed with increasing height ranging from 20 to 38 m. The particle number concentrations in the street canyon showed a stronger association with the pre-existing particle concentrations and the intensity of the solar radiation when the traffic flow was stable. The particle number concentrations were observed higher in Test I than in Test II, probably because the small pre-existing particle concentrations and the intense solar radiation promoted the formation of new particles. The pollutant concentrations in the street canyon showed a stronger association with wind speed and direction. For example, the concentrations of total particle surface area, total particle volume, PM2.5 and CO were lower in Test I (high wind speed andstep-tip canyon) than in Test 11 (low wind speed and wind blowing parallel to the canyon). The equations for the normalized concentration curves of the total particle number, CO and PM2.5 in Test I and Test II were derived. A power functions was found to be a good estimator for predicting the concentrations of total particle number, CO and PM2.5 at different heights. The decay rates of PM2.5 and CO concentrations were lower in Test I than in Test II. However, the decay rate of the total particle number concentration in Test I was similar to that in Test II. No matter how the wind direction changed, for example, in the step-up case or wind blowing parallel to the canyon, the decay rates of the total particle number concentration were larger than those of PM2.5 and CO concentrations. For example, CO concentrations decreased by 0.33 and 0.69 at the heights ranging from 1.5 to 38 m in Test I and Test II, while the total particle number concentrations decreased by 0.72 and 0.85 within the same height ranges in Test I and Test II. It is concluded that the coagulation process, besides the dilution process, affected the total particle number concentration. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

J	Spyropoulou, I				Spyropoulou, Ioanna			Modelling a signal controlled traffic stream using cellular automata	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic flow models; cellular automata; saturation flow	FLOW; SIMULATION; NOISE	Cellular automata models have formed the theory for the development of several transportation models to simulate various types of elements such as vehicles, pedestrians or even railway traffic. Furthermore, they have been applied to simulate several scenarios from very simple (freeway traffic) to rather complicated ones (lane reduction and signal optimisation). However, the properties of the model when used to simulate a signal controlled traffic stream have not been dealt with in great detail. This paper discusses several issues that arise while using the model for the simulation of traffic at signalised intersections. It also investigates the relationships between the randomisation parameter of the model, the model dynamics and the estimated saturation flow. For the deterministic version of the model, the formulas describing traffic quantities at the intersection are derived and are dependent on the desired speed - a parameter of the model. For the stochastic version, one can adopt several different approaches for the application of the randomisation rule, depending on the simulation needs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is found that the flux-density (occupancy) curve of heterogeneous flow, as expected, lies in between two flux-density (occupancy) curves of homogeneous flow R = 0 (all vehicles are slow vehicles) and R = I (ail vehicles are fast vehicles). However, unexpectedly, the velocity-density (occupancy) curve of heterogeneous flow does not. We also found that cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis shows that heterogeneous flow has almost the same strong coupling as homogeneous flow. In other words, when traffic is in free flow or jams, the value of CCF is approximate to be 1.0, while the value is about 0.1 in synchronized flow. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The square-lattice point and the decorated site denote intersections and roads, respectively. In the present model, a car has a finite deterministic path between the origin and the destination, which is assigned to the car from the beginning. In this new model, we found a new phase between the free-flow phase and the frozen-jam phase that is absent from previous models. The new model is characterized by the persistence of a macroscopic cluster. Furthermore, the behavior in this macroscopic cluster phase is classified into three regions characterized by the shape of the cluster. The boundary of the three regions is phenomenologically estimated. When the trip length is short and the car density is high, both ends of the belt-like cluster connect to each other through the periodic boundary with some probability. This type of cluster is classified topologically as a string on a two-dimensional torus. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mitra, S; Washington, S				Mitra, Sudeshna; Washington, Simon			On the nature of over-dispersion in motor vehicle crash prediction models	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						over-dispersion; crash prediction; Bayesian method; intersection safety		Statistical modeling of traffic crashes has been of interest to researchers for decades. Over the most recent decade many crash models have accounted for extra-variation in crash counts-variation over and above that accounted for by the Poisson density. The extra-variation - or dispersion - is theorized to capture unaccounted for variation in crashes across sites. The majority of studies have assumed fixed dispersion parameters in over-dispersed crash model s - tantamount to assuming that unaccounted for variation is proportional to the expected crash count. Miaou and Lord [Miaou, S.P., Lord, D., 2003. Modeling traffic crash-flow relationships for intersections: dispersion parameter, functional form, and Bayes versus empirical Bayes methods. Transport. Res. Rec. 1840, 31-40] challenged the fixed dispersion parameter assumption, and examined various dispersion parameter relationships when modeling urban signalized intersection accidents in Toronto. They suggested that further work is needed to determine the appropriateness of the findings for rural as well as other intersection types, to corroborate their findings, and to explore alternative dispersion functions. This study builds upon the work of Miaou and Lord, with exploration of additional dispersion functions, the use of an independent data set, and presents an opportunity to corroborate their findings. Data from Georgia are used in this study. A Bayesian modeling approach with noninformative priors is adopted, using sampling-based estimation via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Gibbs sampler. A total of eight model specifications were developed; four of them employed traffic flows as explanatory factors in mean structure while the remainder of them included geometric factors in addition to major and minor road traffic flows. The models were compared and contrasted using the significance of coefficients, standard deviance, chi-square goodness-of-fit, and deviance information criteria (DIC) statistics. The findings indicate that the modeling of the dispersion parameter, which essentially explains the extra-variance structure, depends greatly on how the mean structure is modeled. In the presence of a well-defined mean function, the extra-variance structure generally becomes insignificant, i.e. the variance structure is a simple function of the mean. It appears that extra-variation is a function of covariates when the mean structure (expected crash count) is poorly specified and suffers from omitted variables. In contrast, when sufficient explanatory variables are used to model the mean (expected crash count), extra-Poisson variation is not significantly related to these variables. If these results are generalizable, they suggest that model specification may be improved by testing extra-variation functions for significance. They also suggest that known influences of expected crash counts are likely to be different than factors that might help to explain unaccounted for variation in crashes across sites.

A modified NaSch model with density-dependent randomization for traffic flow	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; HIGHWAY; PHYSICS; STATES	Based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model of traffic flow, a modified cellular automaton (CA) traffic model with the density-dependent randomization (abbreviated as the DDR model) is proposed to simulate traffic flow. The fundamental diagram obtained by simulation shows the ability of this modified NaSch model to capture the essential features of traffic flow, e.g., synchronized flow, metastable state, hysteresis and phase separation at higher densities. Comparisons are made between this DDR model and the NaSch model, also between this DDR model and the VDR model. And the underlying mechanism is analyzed. All these results indicate that the presented model is reasonable and more realistic.

J	Wang, R; Liu, M; Kemp, R; Zhou, M				Wang, Ruili; Liu, Mingzhe; Kemp, Ray; Zhou, Min			Modeling driver behavior on urban streets	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						cellular automata; driver behavior; traffic flow; urban traffic	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; TRAFFIC-FLOW; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; SELF-ORGANIZATION; SIMULATION	Traffic flow on straight roads is the most common traffic phenomenon in urban road traffic networks. In this paper, a realistic cellular automaton (CA) model is proposed to investigate driver behavior on urban straight roads based on our field observations. Two types of driver behavior, free and car-following, are simulated. Free driving behavior is modeled by a novel five-stage speeding model (two acceleration stages, one steady stage and two deceleration stages). Car-following processes are simulated by using 1.5-s as the average headway (1.5-s rule), which is observed in local urban networks. Vehicular mechanical restrictions (acceleration and deceleration capabilities) are appropriately reflected by a five-stage speeding model, which has the dual-regimes of acceleration and deceleration. A fine grid (the length of each cell corresponds to 1 m) is used. Our simulation results demonstrate that the introduction of the dual-regimes of acceleration and deceleration, 1.5-s rule and fine grid matches actual driver behavior well on urban straight roads.

Low traffic conditions are considered, and traffic lanes that carry less than 500 vehicles/h are studied. Data are obtained from 10 signalised intersections in Turkey. The lanes are classified with respect to movements of traffic flows. Seven distribution models are taken into account. The goodness of fits of the observations with the theoretical distribution models are evaluated using chi square (chi(2)) and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. The results are considered with respect to both lane type and traffic volumes. The presented results show that log normal, Weibull, gamma or Pearson V distribution models can be used instead of the exponential distribution in modelling vehicle time headways.

This is done by a critical discussion of the pros and cons of the different theoretical approaches and by the analysis of a large set of empirical data with new evaluation techniques. Specifically, we investigate characteristic properties of the congested traffic states on a 30-km-long stretch of the German freeway A5 near Frankfurt/Main. Among the approximately 245 breakdowns of traffic flow at several different bottlenecks in 165 days, we have identified five different kinds of spatiotemporal congestion patterns and their combinations. Based on an "adaptive smoothing method" for the visualization of detector data, we also discuss particular features of breakdowns, such as signs of unstable traffic flow and the "boomerang effect," which often seems to be caused by overtaking maneuvers of trucks. Controversial issues such as "synchronized flow" or stop-and-go waves are addressed as well. Our empirical results are compared with the implications of different theoretical concepts such as first-order traffic models and the phase diagram of congested traffic states predicted by some second-order models and the nonlocal, gas-kinetic based traffic model (GKT model). For a correct understanding of empirical observations such as the "general pattern," it is important to consider particularities such as the fact that off-ramps can act as bottlenecks, when activated by downstream on-ramp bottlenecks. As sequences of off- and on-ramps generate different congestion patterns than single on-ramps, they must be treated as interconnected bottlenecks. Furthermore, our empirical results question Kerner's three-phase theory.

The adopted general approach to the design of universal traffic state estimators for freeway stretches is based on stochastic macroscopic traffic flow modeling and extended Kalman filtering, which are outlined in the paper. The reported investigations were conducted by use of eight-hour traffic measurement data collected from a freeway stretch of 4.1 km close to Munich, Germany. Some key issues are carefully investigated, including the tracking capability of the designed traffic state estimator, significance of the online model parameter estimation, sensitivity of the estimator to the initial values of the estimated model parameters as well as to the related noise standard deviation values, and the capability of the estimator to handle biased flow measurements. The achieved results are quite satisfactory.

Compared with the two-lane optimal velocity model, simulation results indicate that no serious traffic jams occur in the OVFC system when the feedback signal is introduced, and the oscillation of velocity becomes weaker or vanishes. This means that the two-lane OVFC model can suppress the traffic jams effectively.

J	Murena, F; Favale, G				Murena, Fabio; Favale, Giuseppe			Continuous monitoring of carbon monoxide in a deep street canyon	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						deep street canyon; CO; continuous monitoring; air quality; modelling	POLLUTANT DISPERSION; URBAN AREA	The results of a 1-week continuous monitoring campaign of carbon monoxide in a deep street canyon in the city of Naples are reported. CO was selected as a passive pollutant emitted by vehicle exhausts. The geometry of the canyon is: width W = 5.8 in and height H = 33 in (aspect ratio AR = H/W = 5.7). The monitoring campaign was carried out from 14 to 20 June 2006. CO concentration level was measured at pedestrian level (h = 2.5 in) and roof top level (h = 25 in). In the same period traffic flow in the street canyon was manually measured and the CO emission rate from vehicle exhausts was evaluated using the COPERT procedure. Meteorological conditions (wind velocity and direction) are also reported and their effect on CO concentration level in the canyon is discussed. Due to its geometry the street canyon monitored may be considered almost ideal. The results show that the deep street canyon is a "hot spot" compared with roads with high traffic flows in the urban area of Naples, and that significant differences exist between concentration levels at pedestrian and roof top level. Some insights into the effect and relative importance of meteorological parameters on the air quality in the canyon are also given. The monitoring data collected have been made available on the web and can be used by other researchers to test air dispersion models. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Development of distributed real-time decision support system for traffic management centers using microscopic ca model	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY TRANSACTION B-ENGINEERING			English	Article						intelligent transport systems; incident management; microscopic simulation; decision support system		Post incident traffic management on a freeway network depends mainly on the decisions of traffic managers that surface from their individual exposure to similar conditions. This manual approach to tackle a dynamic scenario induces uncertainty, inconsistency and inefficient use of rescue resources. This paper suggests a decision support scheme known as Freeway Incident Analysis System, (FIAS). The novel idea presented here is the use of real time data from the Toll Collection System (TCS) and Vehicle Detection System (VDS). This data is conjugated with the historical data on a microscopic simulation platform to predict traffic flows in a post-incident scenario. The system employs Cellular Automata for the microscopic simulation of vehicle movement, and we also suggest two additional rules in the modified version of the conventional model. This has enabled us to model the dynamic flow parameters in a post incident scenario more realistically.

This problem is solved by means of nonclassical shocks and its well posedness is proved. Then, the solutions so obtained are shown to coincide with the limits of the classical solutions to suitable conservation laws with discontinuous flux function that approximate the constrained problem.

A new overtaking model and numerical tests	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						overtaking safe distanced; reactive delay time; overtaking distance	TRAFFIC FLOW	A new model for overtaking on highway is proposed. The model considers such important factors as the reactive delay time for vehicle acceleration, deceleration, and lane-changing, the safe distance for car-following and the distance for overtaking. The time required for overtaking, the time loss in overtaking procedure and the space-time evolution of vehicle movement are numerically investigated using the model and compared with the results from a survey. Numerical results show that our model can generate the traffic in accord with the observed one. The ovErtaking in a two-lane bidirectional traffic flow is also analyzed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	De Coensel, B; Botteldooren, D; Vanhove, F; Logghe, S				De Coensel, Bert; Botteldooren, Dick; Vanhove, Filip; Logghe, Steven			Microsimulation based corrections on the road traffic noise emission near intersections	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article							INTERRUPTED FLOW; COMPUTER-MODEL; ROUNDABOUTS; PREDICTION; VEHICLES	Urban noise mapping traditionally involves the use of a traffic simulation model, which is often based on the estimation of macroscopic traffic flows. However, intersections and other local traffic management measures are not always modeled correctly. It is well known that the specific deceleration and acceleration dynamics of traffic at junctions can influence local noise emission. Finding the best strategy for using traffic modeling results in noise mapping is a current topic of research in the IMAGINE project. In this paper, a case study is presented, consisting of a large set of microscopic traffic simulations and associated noise emission calculations, which provides some insight into the specific dynamics of the noise emission near different types of intersections. It will be shown that it is possible to refine current traffic noise prediction models, based on macroscopic traffic simulation, using a correction on the average vehicle emission, aggregated in lane segments. A spatial approach should be used, in which inbound and outbound lanes are divided into deceleration, queuing, stopline and acceleration zones. Results from regression analysis on the numerical simulations indicate that meaningful relations between noise corrections and traffic flow parameters such as traffic intensity and composition can be deduced.

J	Barthelemy, M; Barrat, A; Vespignani, A				Barthelemy, Marc; Barrat, Alain; Vespignani, Alessandro			The role of geography and traffic in the structure of complex networks	ADVANCES IN COMPLEX SYSTEMS			English	Article						networks; traffic; transportation systems	SCALE-FREE; CENTRALITY; INTERNET	We report a study of the correlations among topological, weighted and spatial properties of large infrastructure networks. We review the empirical results obtained for the air-transportation infrastructure that motivates a network modeling approach which integrates the various attributes of this network. In particular, we describe a class of models which include a weight-topology coupling and the introduction of geographical attributes during the network evolution. The inclusion of spatial features is able to capture the appearance of non-trivial correlations between the traffic flows, the connectivity pattern and the actual distances of vertices. The anomalous fluctuations in the betweenness-degree correlation function observed in empirical studies are also recovered in the model. The presented results suggest that the interplay between topology, weights and geographical constraints is a key ingredient in order to understand the structure and evolution of many real-world networks.

By relying on detailed aerosol measurements conducted simultaneously at two distances close to a major road, we studied one such episode encountered in Helsinki, Finland, during the wintertime. The observed episode was characterized by exceptionally weak dilution of traffic emissions, with particle number concentration decreasing by no more than 10-30% between 9 and 65 in distances from the road. During the nighttime with relatively minor traffic flow, dilution and particle growth by vapor condensation were found to be the dominant processes in this road-to-ambient evolution stage. The latter process shifted a significant fraction of nucleation mode particles to sizes > 30 nm diameter, modifying thereby the shape of the particle number size distribution. During the rush hours in the morning, particle number concentrations were elevated by approximately an order of magnitude compared with nighttime, such that also the self-coagulation of nucleation mode particles became important. Our study demonstrates that under suitable meteorological conditions (low wind speeds coupled with temperature inversions), traffic emissions are able to affect submicron particle number concentrations over large areas around major roads and may be a dominant source of ultrafine particles in the urban atmosphere. Under conditions characterized by exceptionally slow mixing, simultaneous processing of ultrafine (nucleation and Aitken mode) particles by dilution, self- and inter-modal coagulation, as well as by condensation and evaporation seriously questions the applicability of particle number emission factors, derived from the measurements at few tens of meters from the roadside.

The traffic flow efficiency may be increased via suitable application of several control measures, such as ramp metering, driver information, route guidance, variable speed limits and further link control measures.

Rigorous analyses show that the proposed learning control schemes guarantee the asymptotic convergence of the traffic density to the desired one. The two major features of the learning-based density control are 1) less prior modeling knowledge required in the control system design and 2) the ability to reject exogenous traffic perturbations. The control schemes are applied to a freeway model, and simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Deriving origin-destination data from a mobile phone network	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article								Acquiring high-quality origin-destination (OD) information for traffic in a geographic area is both time consuming and expensive while using conventional methods such as household surveys or roadside monitoring. These methods generally present only a snapshot of traffic situation at a certain point in time, and they are updated in time intervals of up to several years. A technique was developed that makes use of the global system for mobile communications (GSM) mobile phone network. Instead of monitoring the flow of vehicles in a transportation network, the flow of mobile phones in a cell-phone network is measured and correlated to traffic flow. This methodology is based on the fact that a mobile phone moving on a specific route always tends to change the base station nearly at the same position. For a first pilot study, a GSM network simulator has been designed, where network data can be simulated, which is then extracted from the phone network, correlated, processed mathematically and converted into an OD matrix. Primary results show that the method has great potential, and the results inferred are much more cost-effective than those generated with traditional techniques. This is due to the fact that no change has to be made in the GSM network, because the information that is needed can readily be extracted from the base station database, that is the entire infrastructure needed is already in place.

The majority of these efforts have focused on traffic flow along freeways, and it appears that there has been no systematic consideration of signal timing in evacuation planning for urban areas. However, traffic signals can have tremendous impact on the movement of urban populations in an evacuation. In this paper, approaches for signal timing to facilitate evacuation and response in the event of a no-advance-notice disaster requiring evacuation in an urban area are investigated using a simulation model constructed with data from Washington, D.C. The trade-offs between evacuation time and average delay are studied in assessing proposed timing plans.

Model reference adaptive control framework for real-time traffic management under emergency evacuation	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT			English	Article						traffic management; evacuation; emergency services; adaptive systems	ASSIGNMENT	Recent natural or man-made disasters around the world have provided compelling evidence that transportation system plays a crucial role in the emergency evacuation and have stressed the need for effective evacuation traffic management to maximize the utilization of the transportation system and to minimize fatalities and losses. This paper presents a model reference adaptive control (MRAC) framework for real-time traffic management under emergency evacuation. Distinct from the well-studied evacuation planning, real-time traffic management for evacuation aims to dynamically guide (control) traffic flow under evacuation in such a way that certain system objective (e.g., minimization of fatalities or property losses) could be achieved. The proposed framework is based on both dynamic network modeling techniques and adaptive control theory, by considering the traffic network under evacuation as a dynamic system. First, a prescriptive dynamic traffic assignment model is applied to predict, in a short-term and rolling-horizon manner, the desired traffic states based on certain system optimal objectives. This model will serve as a reference point for the adaptive control. Then, the adaptive control system integrates these desired states and the current prevailing traffic conditions collected via the sensing system to produce real-time traffic control schemes. Finally, these traffic control schemes are implemented in the field to guide the real-world traffic flow to evolve towards the desired states. Simulation studies provided in this paper show that the proposed framework based on MRAC can significantly improve the performance of real-time evacuation traffic management.

The simulation show that the frequent lane changing occurs when the lateral distance in car following activities is considered and it gives rise to oscillating waves. In contrast, if the lateral distance is not considered (or considered occasionally), the lane changing appears infrequently and soliton waves occurs. This implies that the stabilization mechanism no longer functions when the lane changing is permitted. Since the oscillating and soliton waves correspond to the unstable and metastable flow regimes, respectively, our study verifies that a phase transition may occur as a result of the lane changing.

J	Yuan, YM; Jiang, R; Wu, QS; Wang, RL				Yuan, Yao-Ming; Jiang, Rui; Wu, Qing-Song; Wang, Ruili			Synchronized flow and phase separation in a two-lane cellular automaton model	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						modified comfortable driving model; symmetric lane-changing rule set; synchronized flow; phase separation	SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; TRAFFIC FLOW; TRANSITIONS; PHYSICS; RULES	This paper extends a cellular automaton model, named modified comfortable driving (MCD) model, to a two-lane roadway. A symmetric lane-changing rule set has been proposed ( Set I). The fundamental diagram, the lane-changing frequency and spacetime plots are presented. It is found that for the two-lane model, there exists a density range in which phase separation between synchronized flow and wide-moving jams on one lane, and between light synchronized flow and heavy synchronized flow on the other lane, can be maintained for quite long periods of time. In this density range, (i) the outflow from jams is synchronized flow; (ii) wide moving jams are sparse. These are consistent with the empirical observation. We also investigate a slightly different lanechanging rule Set II in which stopped vehicles are not allowed to change lane. It is shown that in this case, the phase separation, between free flow and wide moving jams on one lane and between free flow and heavy synchronized flow on the other lane, can be maintained for sufficiently long periods of time. Consequently, the flux is enhanced comparing to that of rule Set I.

Simulating vehicular traffic in a network using dynamic routing	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING OF DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						transportation research; traffic flow; network model; dynamic traffic assignment	FLOW MODEL; WAVES	We present a new numerical code which solves the Lighthill - Whitham model, the classic macroscopic model for vehicular traffic flow, in a network with multi-destinations. We use a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme with approximate Riemann solver to solve the partial differential equations of the Lighthill - Whitham theory. These schemes are very efficient, robust and moreover well adapted to simulations of traffic flows. We develop a theory of dynamic routing including a procedure for traffic flow assignment at junctions which reproduces the correct propagation of irregularities and ensures at the same time conservation of the number of vehicles.

J	Li, F; Zhang, XY; Gao, ZY				Li, Feng; Zhang, Xiu-Yuan; Gao, Zi-You			The effect of restricted velocity in the two-lane on-ramp system	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						on-ramp; cellular automata; traffic flow; restricted velocity region	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; PHYSICS	Usually there are multi-lane on the main road of the on-ramp system. The drivers may decelerate for more safety when they are near the on-ramp. In addition, the car velocity may be restricted according to the traffic regulation. In this paper, we study phenomenon using the cellular automata traffic flow model. We find that: (i) the phase diagram of the two-lane on-ramp system appears a new region, in which the traffic of the on-ramp reaches maximum flow. (ii) The introduction of restricted velocity region will decrease capacity of the on-ramp, but reduce the drastic velocity fluctuation near the on-ramp. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Instantaneous control for traffic flow	MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN THE APPLIED SCIENCES			English	Article						traffic flow; networks; hyperbolic systems; instantaneous control	TIME-DOMAIN DECOMPOSITION; MODEL	The solution methods for optimal control problems with coupled partial differential equations as constraints are computationally costly and memory intensive; in particular for problems stated on networks, this prevents the methods from being relevant. We present instantaneous control problems for the optimization of traffic flow problems on road networks. We derive the optimality conditions, investigate the relation to the full optimal control problem and prove that certain properties of the optimal control problem carry over to the instantaneous one. We propose a solution algorithm and compare quality of the computed controls and run-times. Copyright (C) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Perc, M				Perc, Matjaz			Premature seizure of traffic flow due to the introduction of evolutionary games	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; PRISONERS-DILEMMA GAME; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; COHERENCE RESONANCE; JAMMING TRANSITION; SELF-ORGANIZATION; NOISE; COOPERATION; JAM	We study the impact of evolutionary games on the flow of traffic. Since traffic participants do not always conform to the imposed rules, the introduction of games, i.e. set of strategies defining the behavioural pattern of agents on the road, appears justified. With this motivation, and the fact that individuals can change their strategy in the course of time, the evolutionary prisoner's dilemma game is introduced between neighbouring agents, enabling them to choose between cooperation and defection. Mutual cooperation enables forwarding to both agents for one step, while the defector is able to advance two steps when facing a cooperator, whereby the latter is forced to go one step backwards. Two defectors end up in a halt until the next iteration. Irrespective of their strategy, however, agents can move only if the road ahead is free. Jumps are never allowed. We show that this simple and plausible supplementation of the discrete cellular automaton Biham - Middleton - Levine (BML) model induces a traffic flow seizure by a substantially lower initial density of cars as in the absence of evolutionary games. The phenomenon is explained by studying the one-dimensional variant of the BML model with different advancement steps on the circular ring. In view of the proposed explanation, findings are generalized also to other types of games, such is the snowdrift game, and some statistical properties of gridlock formation in the presence of evolutionary rules are outlined. Our findings suggest that 'bending the law' results in a premature occurrence of traffic jams and thus unnecessarily burdens the transportation system.

J	Hanaura, H; Nagatani, T; Tanaka, K				Hanaura, Hirotoshi; Nagatani, Takashi; Tanaka, Katsunori			Jam formation in traffic flow on a highway with some slowdown sections	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						vehicular dynamics; traffic jam; discontinuity; phase transition	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; BUS ROUTE; MODEL; PHYSICS; SYSTEM; STATES	We study the traffic jams appearing on a single-lane highway with a few slowdown sections. At low density, the flow (current) increases linearly with density, while it saturates at some values of intermediate density. In such case that some slowdown sections have the same speed limit, when the flow begins to saturate, a single discontinuous front (stationary shock wave) occurs before a slowdown section or some discontinuous fronts appear before some slowdown sections. For the case of different speed limits, the discontinuous front occurs before the section of strongest slowdown. The saturated flow is given by the maximal value of the current of the strongest slowdown section. The relationship between the densities is derived before and after the discontinuity. The dependence of jam lengths on density is derived numerically and analytically. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

S	Tubaishat, M; Shang, Y; Shi, HC			IEEE	Tubaishat, Malik; Shang, Yi; Shi, Hongchi			Adaptive traffic light control with wireless sensor networks	2007 4TH IEEE CONSUMER COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3	IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	4th IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference	JAN 11-13, 2007	Las Vegas, NV	IEEE				In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized traffic light control using wireless sensor network. The system architecture is classified into three layers; the wireless sensor network, the localized traffic flow model policy, and the higher level coordination of the traffic lights agents. The wireless sensors are deployed on the lanes going in and out the intersection. These sensors detect vehicles' number, speed, etc. and send their data to the nearest Intersection Control Agent (ICA) which, determines the flow model of the intersection depending on sensors' data (e.g., number of vehicles approaching a specific intersection). Coping with dynamic changes in the traffic volume is one of the biggest challenges in intelligent transportation system (ITS). Our main contribution is the real-time adaptive control of the traffic lights. Our aim is to maximize the flow of vehicles and reduce the waiting time while maintaining fairness among the other traffic lights. Each traffic light controlled intersection has an intersection control agent that collects information from the sensor nodes.

We use the common model in vehicular traffic theory in which a fixed point on the highway sees cars passing it separated. by times with exponentially distributed duration. We obtain the distribution of the distances between cars, which allows us to use techniques from queuing theory for studying connectivity. We obtain explicit expressions for the expected connectivity distance as well as the probability distribution and expectation of the number of cars in a platoon. The analytical model we present is able to describe the effects of various system's parameters, including road traffic parameters (i.e. speed distribution and traffic flow) and transmission range of vehicles, on the connectivity. We further provide bounds obtained using stochastic ordering techniques. Our approach is based on the work of Morandi and Altman [13] that transformed the problem of connectivity distance distribution into that of the distribution of the busy period of an equivalent infinite server queue. We use our analytical results along with publicly available road traffic statistical data to understand connectivity in VANETs.

This is mostly because of the influence of road's traffic parameters like traffic flow and vehicle's speed. One possible way to improve the connectivity is to add some nodes with higher transmission range. These nodes also could give some commercial services to the vehicles on roads (i.e. audio/video service, traffic information, etc.). In this paper we study the connectivity in presence of these nodes which we call mobile base-stations. Our approach is based on the work of Miorandi and Altman [11] that transformed the problem of connectivity distance distribution into that of the distribution of the busy period of an equivalent infinite server queue. We study the effects of mobile base-stations on the connectivity distance and number of nodes in a spatial cluster (platoon). In our investigation we use some publicly available statistical data and realistic traffic patterns. Our model can be used to obtain optimum values for number of base-stations and their transmission range in order to achieve intended degree of connectivity.

We survey the road that is well-known as one of the most congested roads in Bangkok, Thailand. In our survey, we collect two kinds of information, Cell Dwell Time (CDT) using a cellular phone and velocity and position using Global Position System (GPS). To categorize CDT according to Cell Coverage Area (CCA), we have also collected Local Area Code (LAC) and Cell ID. We collect data into '' Green '' survey and '' Red '' survey, and analyze the data using two models: Junction model and Link model. The results have shown that there is significant difference between the two surveys. However, the accuracy of traffic flow estimation is tentatively decreased as the CCA size is decreased.

With recent developments in technology it is possible for the vehicles to be equipped with communication and GPS systems. The equipped vehicles on the road can act as nodes to form an ad hoc network. These nodes can collect information regarding traffic conditions such as position, speed and direction from other participating nodes. Depending upon the number of participating nodes this collected information can provide useful information of driving conditions to the node collecting this information. With proper analysis this information can be used in detecting and or predicting traffic jam conditions on the freeways. In this paper the traffic information gathered by a node in an ad hoc network is viewed as a snapshot in time of the current traffic condition on the road segment. This snapshot is considered as a pattern in time of the current traffic conditions. The pattern is analyzed using pattern recognition techniques. A weight of evidence based classification algorithm is presented to identify different road traffic conditions. The developed algorithm is tested using data generated by microscopic modelling of traffic flow for simulation of vehicle or node mobility in ad hoc networks. Test results are presented under assumption of different levels of vehicles equipped with communication capability.

The microscopic model for a single vehicle introduces a systemic approach of the human in the loop represented by a cascade control structure. When in a constrained situation, by the presence of other vehicles, the distance regulation performed by the human driver is proposed to have a proportional-derivative action, not integral, which results in a tracking error that is linearly dependent with speed. This relation is the base for the speed-density curve for each vehicle. The paper presents a methodology, based on statistic data of road usage, to build the fundamental diagram for traffic control developments.

Generally, these applications are experimented with only few vehicles with a local ad hoc or centralized network. The aim of this paper is to determine the behavior of a such network in a traffic flow. We want to know which conditions are necessary and which quality of service (qos) we can expect. We base our approach on probabilistic formal expression. This approach can be complementary to the solutions brought by network simulators as ns2.

Time based metering as a component of performance-based air traffic management	2007 IEEE/AIAA 26TH DIGITAL AVIONICS SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3	Digital Avionics Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Digital Avionics Systems Conference	OCT 21-25, 2007	Dallas, TX	IEEE, AIAA				Increases in air traffic volume and complexity will create substantial challenges for our nation's Air Traffic Management (ATM) system over the coming decades. The Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) is a response to those challenges, a quantum leap forward that integrates human operators, automation, and aircraft within a net-centric and collaborative environment based on precise performance-based operations and common information sharing. Performance-Based ATM is a mid-term step toward NextGen that has been demonstrated in a simulation environment and shows great promise as a scalable solution that is necessary, desirable, and achievable. Performance-Based ATM is a set of capabilities, validation activities, and an operational concept that is firmly aligned with the NextGen concept and represents an affordable and realistic path to its mid-term implementation. Performance-Based ATM integrates advanced flight deck Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) capabilities with improved ground automation, procedures, and flow strategies to improve predictability and overall ATM system performance. In such an environment time based metering is an essential element in precisely regulating traffic flows across all domains. To date, the application of time based metering in arrival airspace has been accomplished using the Traffic Management Advisor (TMA). Time based metering is an efficient alternative to the current practice of using miles-in-trail metering and becomes particularly beneficial when strategic resolutions can be applied to problems of contention at constrained resources. The Performance-Based ATM concept for time based metering in part drives the need for more accurate trajectories to be used for scheduling meter times and for strategic detection of metering problems. This paper presents the time based metering concept and focuses on the en route capabilities needed to support that concept and identifies significant issues and areas where further research is needed.

Use of aircraft intent data for performance-based ATM operations	2007 IEEE/AIAA 26TH DIGITAL AVIONICS SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3	Digital Avionics Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	26th Digital Avionics Systems Conference	OCT 21-25, 2007	Dallas, TX	IEEE, AIAA				With the advancement of flight deck technologies that improve communication, navigation, and surveillance performance, as well as advancements in ground automation, future National Airspace System (NAS) operations can be based on more accurate aircraft trajectories than are available in today's NAS. The precision that results from trajectory-based operations will improve the efficiency of Traffic Flow Management (TFM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) operations, as well as the productivity of TFM and ATC service providers. Performance-based Air Traffic Management (P-ATM) is a set of capabilities, validation activities, and an operational concept for the NAS that promotes and takes advantage of flight deck and ground automation advancements. It is a step toward Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that has been demonstrated in a simulation environment and shows great promise as a scalable solution that is necessary, desirable, and achievable. A key enhancement in the progression towards NextGen is the transmission of aircraft intent information and its use in both air and ground-based systems to support trajectory-based operations. This paper addresses three areas of research and development to support this enhancement in the context of the P-ATM capabilities. These areas are: Development of avionics interface definitions for the provision of Target State intent data. Importance of including planned transitions in the aircraft's airspeed as part of its intent information.

The plug-in HEV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of BEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEV, i.e. the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the destination of the trip. In the past, the trip information has been considered as future information for vehicle operation and thus unavailable a priori. This situation can be changed by the current advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on the use of on-board Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach of optimal power management of PHEV in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the final time of the cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid SUV. Only fuel consumption is considered for the current stage of study. Simulation results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with rule-based power management. Furthermore, simulations on several driving cycles using the proposed method showed much better consistency in fuel economy compared to the rule-based control.

Traffic signal control using fuzzy logic and evolutionary algorithms	2007 IEEE CONGRESS ON EVOLUTIONARY COMPUTATION, VOLS 1-10, PROCEEDINGS	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation	SEP 25-28, 2007	Singapore, SINGAPORE	IEEE				This paper presents a fuzzy control system to regulate the traffic flow approaching a single real intersection which consists of multiple lanes with turns, by adjusting time parameters and phases of traffic signals. The lanes are cataloged into several groups controlled by individual traffic lights. These lights are further arranged into several light phases. A fuzzy controller was developed to control the time length of each light phase. Evolutionary algorithms were employed to generate the fuzzy logic rule base, using real statistical traffic data for the intersection. To simulate real car flows, new acceleration and deceleration movement models were developed to ensure safe driving by avoiding possible collision. A new fitness function that comprehensively characterizes car flow delay induced from signals was constructed to evaluate the performance of the fuzzy logic controller. Key performance criteria obtained using the fuzzy logic controller were compared with those obtained by the controller used by the Department of Main Roads, Queensland at the intersection.

But how to quantify the impact of environment conditions on traffic? A research project co-funded by the Austrian Ministry of Transport tested several methods to show dependencies and interaction between weather, events and traffic flow. This document explains the different approaches to solve the problem and summarizes that the impact of environment conditions is often predictable. Roads and traffic on specific roads have typical characteristics and allow to detect regular patterns. Based on this knowledge a new quality of traffic forecast can be developed.

Infrastructure managers are interested in estimating optimal freeway sensor density for new construction and retrofits. This paper describes a concept developed from first principles of traffic flow for establishing optimal sensor density based on the magnitude of under- and over-prediction of travel time during shock passages when using the midpoint method. A suggested aggregate measure developed from vehicle hours traveled (VHT) is described for a reasonable range of detector densities. Extensions of the method to account for both recurring and nonrecurring congestion are included. Finally some suggestions for future research are described.

Most researchers pay much attention to the work of planning method or control strategy, and bring forward various simulating models, but no deeper researches about confliction among motor vehicles, non-motor vehicles and pedestrians are presented. Distinguished from traditional simulation models, this paper seeks to statistic models of road user's confliction behavior based on traffic data collected from urban intersections, and validate these models using different traffic data. It is shown that these established statistic models can apply to mixed traffic flow condition appropriately, which means these models can be used in traffic engineering, micro traffic simulation and traffic signal control strategy.

The performance of AID algorithms is evaluated using the common criteria of detection rate, false alarm rate, and mean time to detection. Moreover, the curve of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) is also used to compare the detection performance. Simulated traffic data and real data collected at the I-880 Freeway in California were used in these experiments. Traffic flow parameters, such as volume, speed, occupancy and time headway both at upstream and downstream, and derived data generated from basic traffic flow parameters are used to build the PLSR model and SVM models. Several experiments using the original data or derived data have been performed to make comparisons between PLSR and SVM. The problem resulted from imbalance data and its influence on detection performance is also discussed. The test results have demonstrated that the PLSR has great potential to detect incident.

In the past, various methodologies have been developed for traffic flow prediction. However, most of existing methods for the formulation of traffic flow are complex. In this paper, using a 2-D histogram projection method, a temporal-spatial traffic flow data is first reduced to a 2-D scatter plot and a 2-D Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) is then used to estimate the traffic flow.

A key problem of using probe vehicles is to determine vehicle's sampling period and probe sample size. This paper addresses the sampling issue of using probe vehicles for detecting traffic information. An extended Nyquist sampling theorem based on signal processing theory is proposed to derive bounds on the sampling period and probe sample size. We also develop a Traffic & Information-collecting Simulation Platform (TISP), to simulate the traffic flows in a road network and generate probe vehicle data for analysis. We demonstrate through simulations that the traffic situations can be reconstructed from the samples without distortion according to the designed sampling period and sample size. The methods proposed in this paper can be a valuable tool for designers on planning parameters in the probe vehicle-based traffic information system.

This paper aims to improve the conventional deterministic approach to the freeway capacity by estimating parameters of the various probability distribution functions that are likely to represent the probabilistic nature of freeway traffic capacity. Firstly, Maximum Likelihood Estimation method is applied to estimate the capacity distribution function. Then, confidence intervals for the capacity distribution function are calculated using Bayesian statistics techniques that can address the difficult problem of censored data. Finally, a comparative analysis has been conducted between the estimations of deterministic and probabilistic models to come up with a conclusion regarding spatial and temporal characteristics of freeway capacity. The analysis results indicate that including stochasticity in the model estimation results in better representation of observed data and thus improve understanding of real-life situations.

From the analysis we know that the traffic data collection is a stochastic process. The data from detectors are functions of time and road location. So when using detectors data for research traffic flow characters, time and location attribute of these data must be considered. After using the actual data we have gotten the conclusions that, for analyzing and researching the traffic flow characters, using one usual traffic model or one model at a certain location to research the whole road traffic How characters is not exact. According to the results in paper the space attribute of detectors must be taken into consideration for researching the expressway traffic flow characters.

Particularly, discrete wavelet transform is adopted for flow feature extraction, because it is insensitive to disturbance/scaling, and zooms in multiple finer granularities. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm is then used to cluster road links into groups, for which different feature sets are considered for different purposes. Two applications of outlier detection and traffic flow prediction are given as examples of the benefit of similarity mining. The proposed method is tested with the data collected from a typical urban traffic network, Beijing, China. Experiments indicate that the proposed method offers a more flexible analysis of multi-level similarities, which might be ignored by traditional methods.

The two-fluid (the vehicles in traffic flow are divided into moving vehicles and stopped vehicles) model is able to describe the average operating performance of urban traffic, but it is difficult to collect individual vehicles data in the network for practical application of the model in urban area. The sampling strategies on data collection based on probe vehicles are stated in the paper and trip histories of probe vehicles are aggregated across link-based microtrip in order to estimate the model parameters. The algorithm of cost function is applied to map-matching with the help of GIS (Geographic Information System). The critical speed for identifying the vehicle state is determined through sensitivity analysis. The field experiments showed that the application of probe vehicle data is reliable to assess the network performance and traffic condition of urban street network.

To achieve better freeway management, effective traffic performance evaluation parameters are crucial. Most of the current evaluation parameters are from a macroscopic point of view, e.g., level-of-service based on traffic density. This paper proposes evaluation parameters in a microscopic way and investigates the relationship between macroscopic level of service (LOS) derived from roadway sensor readings and the microscopic quality of service (QOS) of traffic from the drivers' point of view. This is important for several ITS applications that need to monitor roadway network traffic conditions, e.g., incident detection. It has been found that macroscopic LOS does not represent the microscopic traffic flow quality very well. A new criterion for determining microscopic traffic flow quality is proposed using average speed values and speed coefficient of variation (CV) of micro-trips. A Gaussian mixture model and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm are used to find the best partitioning thresholds. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed quality of service measure.

We analyzed the linear stability of this model by introducing a small disturbance into the homogeneous traffic flow on a single circular lane. The stability condition shows the larger delay time of response than previous models. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation was derived by performing the nonlinear analysis near the critical point and the kink-antikink soliton solution was obtained also.

In this paper, cooperative driving at lane closures is studied. First, the solution space of all allowable driving schedules is described by a spanning tree in terms of vehicle safe passing order. The corresponding trajectory planning method is then proposed to generate the acceptable lane changing profiles. The proposed algorithm is fast and reliable, but sometimes yields conservative solutions than previous algorithms.

A fuzzy logic controller for isolated signalized intersection with traffic abnormality considered	2007 IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1-3			English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium	JUN 13-15, 2007	Istanbul, TURKEY	IEEE				This paper presents a fuzzy logic controller for an isolated signalized intersection. The controller controls the traffic light timings and phase sequence to ensure smooth flow of traffic with minimal delay. Usually fuzzy traffic controllers are optimized to maximize traffic flows/minimize traffic delays under. typical traffic conditions. Consequentially, these are not the optimal traffic controllers under exceptional traffic cases such as roadblocks and road accidents. We propose a new fuzzy traffic controller that can optimally control traffic flows under both normal and exceptional traffic conditions. In this system, sensors are placed strategically at incoming and outgoing links (lanes) and the controller utilize the information received from these sensors to make optimal decisions to minimize the traffic delays. A simulator is developed to evaluate the performance of traffic controllers under different conditions. Results show that the performance of the proposed traffic controller is similar to that of conventional fuzzy traffic controllers under normal traffic conditions and is better that of others under abnormal traffic conditions.

This paper addresses the sampling issues of using probe vehicles for detecting traffic information in a road network. A spatial and temporal analysis model based on signal processing theory is established and used to derive bounds on the sampling period, transmitting period and sample sizes of probe vehicles. We also develop a Traffic & Information-collecting Simulation Platform (TISP), to simulate the traffic flows in a road network and generate probe vehicle data for analysis. The simulation results find that traffic flow has strong correlation in terms of time and space, which is critical to the sampling problem, and the system requires 2% probe penetration to guarantee the information integrity.

In this new model, traffic situation is suggested to be divided into car-following and free travel regions, and in car-following area the stimulus is a function of space difference between the current headway and the empirical desired headway with a constant sensitivity. We investigate this model with numerical method and it demonstrates some complex physical features observed in real traffic such as existence of three phases: free, synchronized, and jam flow; spontaneous formation of traffic jams; sudden flow drop in flow-density plane; local cluster effects in synchronized regime; traffic hysteresis in transition between the free and the synchronized flow. Furthermore, the proposed model also predicts that in the synchronized flow regime there exists a unique stable state to relative density, which is insusceptible to noise.

The prediction model of traffic flow must be established to satisfy the intelligent need of high precision through the problems analysis of the exiting predicting methods in chaos traffic flow time series and the demand of uncertain traffic system. Based on the powerful nonlinear mapping ability of support vectors and the characteristics of fuzzy logic which can combine the prior knowledge into fuzzy rules, the traffic flow predicting model of chaotic time series was established by support vector machine regression for fuzzy rule-based model. The support vector learning mechanism extracts support vectors and generates fuzzy rules. The function was realized which extracts the typical samples as the final learning samples from the large-scale samples. The fuzzy basis function was chosen as the kernel function of the support vector machine to fuse the two mechanisms into a new fuzzy inference system. The predictive model could be updated online. The simulation result shows that the method is feasible and the predicting result have more precision than that using other methods.

Correlation dimensions and recurrence plots were calculated to analyze a freeway traffic flow. It is found that the traffic flow is chaotic and fractal under a large range of observation time windows. Correlation dimensions decrease with the increasing of time windows in minute scales. Different from the formerly deduction that fractal characteristics would vanish with the decreasing of time windows, the numerical estimation results show that correlation dimensions increase with the! increasing of time windows in second scales. It is also suggested that a reliable forecasting requires that the length of historical data should be more than ten times of correlation dimensions of a short-term traffic flow.

Approaches to calculation of these durations include traffic-responsive strategies as well as fixed-time ones. In all cases, these control methods require some parameters that will ultimately depend on traffic flows. The present paper introduces an adaptive method for responsive control that adjusts the stage durations according to traffic flows. The methodology used for this is approximate dynamic programming, which uses a state-dependent estimate of future optimised costs to assess decisions. Results are presented for example applications, showing favourable performance by comparison with other approaches.	[Heydecker, B. G.; Cai, Chen; Wong, C.

One key issue in the ITS is the problem of short-term traffic flow forecasting which targets at forecasting traffic flow value in the near future (short-term) based on the real time data and historic data collected by data gathering systems in transportation networks. A lot of approaches have been proposed in past references to forecast short-term traffic flow. Time-series-based method, Kalman Filter method, nonparametric method and neural-networks-based method are representative approaches. However, although researchers have proposed those prediction methods and declared their validities and efficiencies, no one has devoted on improving prediction capabilities through ensemble learning methods continuously. This paper explores how the ensemble learning method, namely bagging, remarkably decreases the prediction error such as in the radial basis function neural network. Moreover, real freeway short-term traffic flow predictions such as the effects of the extent of prediction, the "look-back" interval and the time resolution on the prediction accuracy are carefully studied based on a real traffic flow data gathered at Loop 3 freeway in Beijing, China.

Such disasters could potentially disrupt the operations of critical transportation infrastructure systems. Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) manages Virginia's highway infrastructure through its five high-technology communications hubs called Smart Traffic Centers (STCs). STCs are staffed by transportation engineers, who monitor traffic flow, provide traveler information, and manage incidents. In the event of incidents, STC operators dispatch roadside assistance and post warnings to motorists via variable messaging signs and public radio advisories. Transportation system failures further compound a disaster's devastating economic, physical, and social consequences. A hurricane makes roads inaccessible, resulting in the inability of the general workforce to commute. Since STCs enable workforce mobility, the hurricane's effects are magnified should the STC itself be impacted. The STC's physical structure is vulnerable to high winds and flooding, which may disconnect its power supply, disable communications, or damage essential equipment. A pandemic, on the other hand, can impact the health and availability of STC employees, who require specialized training and experience with intelligent transportation systems. It is critical for the STCs to develop continuity of operations (COOP) plans. Such plans identify and detail specific procedures for maintaining essential functions in the event of a disaster. The Virginia Information Technology Agency (VITA) and Virginia Department of Emergency Management (VDEM) require STCs to comply with COOP standards and other security policies. The project team employed risk-based methodologies to assist the STCs in achieving compliance. In particular, this paper discusses four case studies featuring the development and application oh (i) probabilistic risk analysis tools (e.g., data mining, regression analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation using incident databases), (ii) a dynamic recovery analysis model aided by geographic information systems (GIS) to predict the ripple effects of disasters across multiple sectors, and (iii) multi-criteria tradeoff analysis to evaluate the efficacy of risk management solutions. The results and findings from this research will contribute to Virginia's preparedness planning for managing disasters.

The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEV, i.e. the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the destination of the trip. Globally optimized charge-depletion power management would be desirable. However, this has so far been hampered due to the a priori nature of the trip information and the prohibitive computational cost of global optimization techniques such as dynamic programming (DP). This situation can be changed by the current advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on the use of on-board GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, charge-depletion control of PHEV is nearly globally optimized with a two-scale dynamic programming approach based on trip modeling with real-time and historical traffic data. For DP based charge-depletion control of PHEV, the SOC is desired to drop to a specific terminal value at the end of the trip. By specifying the origin and destination of a trip, the trip model, i.e. the driving cycle, is first obtained with the average of the historic traffic data, and the globally optimized SOC profile can be obtained by solving the overall or the macro-scale DP problem. The actual power management can be adapted during real-time vehicle operation with a micro-scale DP framework. The whole trip is divided into a number of segments, and for each segment, a smaller DP will be solved using the on-line traffic data transmitted to the vehicle from the traffic flow sensors within the segment. The SOC obtained in the macro-scale DP solution at the terminal location is reinforced to be the final value. Simulation study has been performed on a hybrid SUV model from ADVISOR, and a defined trip in the greater Milwaukee area. The simulation results demonstrated significant improvement in fuel economy using DP based charge-depletion control compared to rule based control, and also the benefit of adaptation using the two-scale DP method.

We use the shadows underneath vehicles as a means of detecting, them. Our method specifies the size of each vehicle according to the distance between its front and rear tires and our method also specifies the lane on which if exists. Our method has the advantage of automatically creating and updating background images and of automatically, estimating and updating a threshold value we need to binarize background subtraction images and to enhance the vehicle detection accuracy.

For some forecasting model denoising will have some good results, but on the contrary it will reduce forecasting accuracy for some other models. It is very important to introduce effective denoising methods to improve the precision of forecasting in this circumstance. In this paper, the limited denoising based on wavelet transform is proposed. Through the improvements to the determination of the threshold value of non-linear wavelet transform denoising method, limited denoising is achieved. Application of road traffic flow forecasting show that the method is effective.

Based on analyzing the demand of intelligent transportation system and the problems of the exiting recognition methods, the intelligent real-time recognition method of chaos in traffic flow was proposed. The principle and the structure of the system are briefly introduced. There are online recognition subsystem and offline recognition subsystem mainly. Normal methods are used in the offline recognition model. The online recognition model was established using reduced support vector machine, which the wavelet packet energy features vector of the anterior time series of traffic flow in every training samples were used as input variables. The reduced samples are treated as the final training sample. When the new samples are appended, the reduced set may be updated. The rules of models can be updated and the problem of large sample size could be solved. The simulation result shows that the method is correct and feasible. And it can satisfy the real-time requirement of chaos recognition.

Since the microscopic traffic flow simulation model can capture a greater level of details of the network, it can closely evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of a controller in a real transportation network before an actual implementation. The highway stretch is based on the Berkeley Highway Laboratory (BHL) and is validated with field data. The validation results show that the model properly captures the congestion characteristics of the BHL section. Also, based on the validated model, critical densities and other traffic flow characteristics in mixed manual and ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) traffics are estimated.

Re-identified IVD is detailed microscopic traffic data describing thousands of individual vehicle trajectories passing a number Of Consecutive MIDAS (Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling) loops. Over 50.000 individual vehicle data collected from the UK motorway are used to train in ANN. Artificial neural network models generally use a mathematical model for information processing with a functional architecture that resembles file neuron structure of the human brain. These models are capable of learning from training examples and demonstrating learned behaviour in unseen situations. hence leading to more realistic behaviour. These concepts and techniques have wider implications for traffic microsimulation. Microsimulation plays an important role in traffic and transport research. In particular it can be used to appraise new transport schemes, help predict short/medium term traffic conditions (e.g. flow breakdown from traffic behaviour), improve the analyses (or assessment of the impact) of traffic flow and its characteristics. Ail animation visualisation tool is also described to integrate the IVD/ANN to aid interactive manipulation of the simulation and test the qualitative validity of the work. The results from the trained neural network model demonstrate learned behaviour by mimicking motorway traffic behaviour, e.g. car following.

Therefore, many emerging methods have been designed to predict traffic flow of freeways. However, the ellipsoidal neural fuzzy model, originally developed for control and pattern recognition problems, was seldom used in forecasting traffic flow. The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of ellipsoidal neural fuzzy model in predicting highway traffic. Monthly traffic data at Tai-Shan tollgate of a freeway in Taiwan are collected to depict the performance of forecasting models. Three other neural network models, namely backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), and radial basis function neural networks (RBFNN) and general regression neural networks (GRNN) models are used to predict the same traffic data sets. Simulation results reveal that the ellipsoidal neural fuzzy time-series (ENFTS) model is superior to the other models. Therefore, the ENFTS is a feasible and promising approach in predicting freeway traffic.

The current travel times, in RTIS, are estimated by real-time AVI data, the off-line travel time estimates and the related variance-covariance relationships between road links. The real-time AVI data adopted for RTIS are Autotoll tag data in Hong Kong; whereas the off-line link travel time estimates and their variance-covariance matrices are obtained from a traffic flow simulator. On the basis of integration of these real-time and off-line traffic data, the current traffic conditions on Hong Kong major roads can be estimated at five-minute intervals. A case study is carried out in Kowloon Central urban area to collect observed data for validation of the results of the proposed RTIS.	[Tam, Mei Lam; Larn, William H.

The present paper proposes a method based on Principal Component Analysis and Support Vector Regression (PCA-SVR) for a short-term simultaneously prediction of network traffic flow which is multidimensional compared with traditional single point. Data from a typical traffic network of Beijing City, China are used for the analysis. Other models such as ANN and ARIMA are also developed as a comparison of the performance of both these techniques is carried out to show the effectiveness of the novel method.

Air quality in vicinity of a government school in Kuwait	Air Pollution XV	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	APR 23-25, 2007	Algrave, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		congestion; pollutants; correlation		There is a growing concern in Kuwait for the air quality in the vicinity of schools. The problem is exacerbated at peak times of congestion, which adversely affects the traffic flow and air quality. Several primary pollutants have been observed to be excessive during the peak periods in the country. Air quality in the vicinity of a government school was assessed in March 2006 for a period of two weeks using an air pollution monitoring station, which continuously recorded various pollutants' concentrations and meteorological variables at five-minute intervals. The results show that during the weekdays, the measured pollutants emitted from the road traffic next to the selected school, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were always under the allowable limits for Kuwaiti air quality standards, except for a single occurrence of increased NO2 concentration at morning hours. On the other hand, the values of non-methane hydrocarbon pollutants were found to be several times above the Kuwaiti air quality standards throughout the investigated period. The suspended particulates (PM10)) concentrations have twice exceeded the limits of Kuwaiti air quality standards. A traffic counter was used to record the number of cars in the main road next to the school in fifteen-minute intervals for ten days during the monitoring period for air quality. Statistical analysis was used in order to test whether there is any correlation between variations in the CO concentrations and the traffic frequency during working days' morning and afternoon periods. A relation was developed for predicting the necessary reduction in traffic based on the necessary reduction in CO concentrations.

Traffic pollutant emissions in Barreiro city	Air Pollution XV	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	APR 23-25, 2007	Algrave, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		urban traffic; atmospheric pollutants; urban environment		Urban traffic is becoming a major problem, since most people use their own private car for all kind of trips, increasing the traffic congestion and atmospheric pollution. The purpose of this work was to study the atmospheric pollutants dispersion in Barreiro highway (IC21), in two specific situations, a traffic lights crossroad and a roundabout. The pollutants studied were traffic related pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and CO (carbon monoxide). A traffic counting field campaign and particulate matter measurements were carried out in the light traffic crossroad and in the roundabout of the highway. Data from monitoring network stations was also collected. All this information was introduced in a dispersion model (ADMS-urban), to obtain a spatial simulation of the pollutants dispersion. Vehicle number, class and speed, fuel type, time of the day and urban street canyon were the traffic related parameters used by the model. Meteorological variables, such as wind speed and direction, relative humidity, temperature and heat flux were also taken into consideration to understand pollutant behaviour. The model results show the pollutants dispersion, on the IC21 highway, in two different meteorological scenarios: winter and summer. Winter seems to be the worst scenario for NO, and CO background concentrations, whereas PM tends to deposit due to rain, decreasing its concentration in this season. In summer, ozone (03) concentration increases due to the photochemical reaction with some pollutants such as NO.. Analysing PM emissions, in the specific situations of light traffic crossroad and roundabout, on the IC21 highway, environmental advantages were found in the roundabout, despite its larger traffic flow, as it has a smaller PM concentration, even though it is above the legal limits.

Simulation of fuel consumption and emissions in typical traffic circumstances in Belgium	Air Pollution XV	WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT		English	Proceedings Paper	15th International Conference on Modelling, Monitoring and Management of Air Pollution	APR 23-25, 2007	Algrave, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol, WIT Transact Ecol & Environm		vehicle emissions; real traffic conditions; GPS recordings; emission simulation		During the execution of the project Floating Automotive Data Collection (FADC), various traffic conditions were recorded using in-vehicle measurements. A series of reference measurements were performed on a fixed route in Belgium in real traffic circumstances, including motorway, rural and city traffic. Three vehicles were used for the reference measurements: a passenger car, a delivery van, and a delivery truck. An on-board device recorded vehicle speed and GPS position on second-basis. The resulting speed profiles were used as input in the vehicle emission simulation programme VeTESS to estimate fuel consumption and emissions of certain vehicles driving according to these speed profiles. The goal of these calculations was to quantify the effect of preventing traffic jams. From the simulations it was concluded that a reduction in average speed does not necessarily lead to higher fuel consumption. Actually when average speed is reduced from speeds above 100 km/h down to 80 or 60 km/h, fuel consumption can even be expected to decrease. Of course traffic jams are more about low average speeds. The simulations showed that when average speed drops below 30 or 40 km/h, fuel consumption increases significantly. Emissions of NO., CO and HC also increase in this case. So concerning fuel consumption and emissions it is indeed worth the effort to prevent traffic jams and slow traffic and to improve the traffic flow. The role of traffic jam detection is very important to take measures to improve the traffic flow and this way save fuel and reduce emissions.

According to this approach, our system consists of agents and their world. In the traffic context, the world consists of cars, road networks, traffic lights, etc. Each of these agents controls all traffic lights at a road junction by an observe-think-act cycle. That is, the agent repeatedly observes the current traffic condition at the junction, it then uses this information to reason with condition-action rules to determine how the agent should act in what traffic condition, and finally it performs those actions in order to efficiently manage the traffic flows. We have also developed a NetLogo-based traffic simulator to serve as the agents' world. Our approach is experimented with traffic control of a few connected junctions and the result obtained is promising; it can reduce the average delayed time of each car at each traffic-light near a junction rather substantially when compared with other approaches.

A multi-objective, simultaneous optimization problem is formulated to obtain a mutually consistent solution between the resulting O-D matrix and the path/link flow loading pattern. A genetically augmented microscopic simulation procedure is used to determine the path flow pattern between each O-D pair by estimating the set of turning proportions at each intersection. The proposed approach circumvents the restrictions associated with employing a user-optimal Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) procedure and provides a stochastic global search of the optimal O-D trip and turning flow distributions. The application of the model into a real arterial street sub-network demonstrates its ability to provide results of satisfactory accuracy within fast computing speeds and, hence, its potential usefulness to support the deployment of dynamic urban traffic management systems.

Analysis of full-scale data obtained in a street canyon	ATMOSFERA			English	Article						urban air quality; street canyons; traffic pollution	VEHICLE-INDUCED TURBULENCE; URBAN DISPERSION MODELS; STATISTICS; EMISSION; WIND	In urban areas high air pollutant concentrations may be observed, mostly within street canyons, where buildings and other obstacles disturb the airflow and turbulence. Air motions inside the street canyons are influenced by aerodynamic and thermal effects and by the movements of the vehicles. In this article, we analyze hourly CO and NOx concentrations measured at 1.5 m height on the west side of a street canyon of Gottinger Strasse in Hannover (Germany) and background CO and NOx, wind speed and direction that have been measured on the roof of a nearby building. Information of traffic flow in the street is also available. Results show the presence of a vortex cell inside the street canyon when the ambient wind is greater than 1.8 m/s and is mainly perpendicular to the street axis. We evaluated of the relative influence of ambient and traffic-induced turbulences on local concentrations inside the canyon. The results show that traffic-induced turbulence becomes important when the wind is lower than 2 m/s.

In the theoretical framework of gas-kinetic traffic flow model, the probability of capable passing is essential for ITS. The probability of capable passing is assumed be a linear function of the traffic concentration, indicating that the probability of capable passing decreases proportionally with an increasing concentration. This work improves the model by introducing the speed desired by the driver into the original two-lane cellular automata (CA) model. This study also examines the accuracy of the linearity assumption. A capable passing principle is established to simulate the capable passing probability for different concentrations and can be embedded in a system on chip of ITS.

Various models are developed to understand single-lane traffic, multilane traffic, lane-changing behavior and network traffic situations based on the basic CA rules proposed by Nagel et al. In this paper, a multi-class user traffic flow CA model is proposed to investigate the influence of driving behavior in traffic flow. Slow down possibility and maximal speed are two main variables, which determine driving behavior. Simulation scenario shows that the diversity of driving behavior will induce unstable traffic flow even chaos phenomena. Traffic controlling and management strategies are also discussed in this study. According to the results, optimal strategies may be developed and maximize traffic flow.

The traffic flow forecasting involves a rather complex nonlinear data pattern. Recently, support vector regression (SVR) model has been widely used to solve nonlinear regression and time series problems. This investigation presents a short-term traffic forecasting model which combines SVR model with continuous ant colony optimization (SVRCACO), to forecast inter-urban traffic flow. A numerical example of traffic flow values from northern Taiwan is employed to elucidate the forecasting performance of the proposed model. The simulation results indicate that the proposed model yields more accurate forecasting results than the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) time-series model.

This work formulates the dynamic traffic flows by a parameter-driven discrete time series model. A modified Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is proposed to estimate the parameters of the model. The conditional expectation given y in the E step of the EM algorithm is replaced by the marginal expectation. Applications of the model and the algorithm are illustrated by analyzing the traffic flow data. Through the data collected by the detectors, the traffic condition about the network can be estimated, smoothed and predicted. This model can be embedded in a chip for signal control and queue management procedures of ITSs.

This work is conducted by The National Consortium for Remote Sensing in Transportation-Flows (NCRST-F), led by The Ohio State University, supported by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The major focus is on improving the efficiency of transportation systems by integration of remotely sensed data with traditional ground data to monitor and manage traffic flows. The two primary research activities presented in our earlier publications were the accuracy and reliability of the sensor geolocation/georegistration and the image processing and object modelling. This paper is a summary overview of the NCRST-F research accomplishments over that past three years. The emphasis is on the demonstration of the operational/processing capabilities, while the algorithmic developments and implementation were published earlier in several papers cited here. Recent enhancements in spatial and temporal resolution of LiDAR data can now allow for effective detection and tracking of moving objects. Thus, in this paper, a special focus is on the LiDAR-based traffic flow extraction techniques. The methodology of extracting vehicle information together with the road surface modelling supported by precisely georeferenced LiDAR data augmented by LiDAR intensity information is discussed. We demonstrate that algorithms developed under the NCRST-F program are capable of fast and robust identification of the vehicles by their shape (especially the vertical profiles), proving LiDAR's ability to preserve the geometry of a moving object better as compared to conventional imaging, where the projection from 2D to 3D can significantly distort shape in the image domain. We demonstrate that if LiDAR data of sufficient spatial density are available, vehicle extraction and their classification can be effectively performed simultaneously with efficient and automated road surface extraction and modelling. It is shown, however, that for better accuracy and reliability, a fusion of LiDAR with frame image data is desirable. The examples of the vehicle extraction and the road surface modelling are based on two high-density (2-4 points/m(2)) LiDAR datasets collected on February 19, 2004 over the downtown Toronto area, and on December 2, 2004 over the U.S. Route 40 in the Madison County, OH calibration range, with the Optech ALTM 30/70 LiDAR system. High-accuracy georegistration of the LiDAR data was provided by the Applanix POS AV system (http://www.applanix.com/).

Asymmetric simple exclusion process describing conflicting traffic flows	EPL			English	Article							QUENCHED DISORDER; SYSTEMS; DYNAMICS; MODEL; INTERSECTION	We use the asymmetric simple exclusion process for describing the vehicular traffic flow at the intersection of two streets. No traffic lights control the traffic flow. The cars approaching to the intersection point yield to each other to avoid collision. This yielding dynamics is modelled by implementing the exclusion process to the intersection point of the two streets. Closed boundary condition is applied to the streets. We utilize both mean-field approach and extensive simulations to find the model characteristics. In particular, we obtain the fundamental diagrams and show that the effect of interaction between chains can be regarded as a dynamic impurity at the intersection point. Copyright (c) EPLA, 2007.

This paper discusses the development of a visual environment for micro-simulation of vehicle traffic flow in road networks and highways, employing cellular automata. The integrated tool targets at non-expert users who wish to study urban traffic and not smulationists, thus we focus on parameterization capabilities and visualization features. The environment copes with expandability and parameterization of both the road networks and the Simulation rules. Our goal is to facilitate the construction of hierarhical modular traffic models, provide the ability to experiment with alternative simulation rulesets and offer efficient viualization, which accomodates monitoring traffic conditions and exporting useful conclusions.

A WebGIS system functioning to provide real-time road condition information was developed in this paper. In order to ensure the logic and reliability of data management, a uniform GeoDatabase space database was established based on these three factors as below: the difference of travel volume in different time and road, real time dynamic updating traffic database, and the traffic space dataset in Beijing. In this GeoDatabase the right connectivity of multi-layer data was investigated. In the shortest road search routine, some parameters, such as traffic flow and the length of cond path, which may be concerned by many users, were used as weights to determinate an optimal road. The dynamic updating data could be stored in the database in the format of GeoDatabase, the quantitive research to determine the optimal weight coefficient of travel carrying capacity could be available through proper traffic model and real time dynamic updating data. Besides, the final traffic model would be formed considering the length of optimal path. This intelligent transportation WebGIS inquiry system is developed on base of Visual Studio.NET and Arcgis Server platform. The system would publish data through Web server and supply clients with the service to inquire the real time optimal travel path in Beijing.

For more precise estimation of noise in urban network where vehicles are mainly in stop and go running conditions, vehicle sound power level (for acceleration/deceleration cruising and ideal vehicle) is incorporated in DRONE. The calculation performance of DRONE is increased by evaluating the noise in two steps of first estimating the unit noise database and then integrating it with traffic simulation. Details of the process from traffic simulation to contour maps are discussed in the paper and the implementation of DRONE on Tsukuba city is presented.

Moreover, how to finish the short-term traffic forecast is becoming premise and key of achieving traffic control and inducement. Therefore, to build up a dependable and accurate forecast model for short-time transportation flows is a popular and core topic in the ITS research realm. In this paper, a new forecast method for city short-term transportation flows is presented. The model based on Neuro-fuzzy decision tree modeling method is different from traditional modeling methods. Neural networks-fuzzy decision tree improves FDT's classification accuracy and extracts more accuracy human interpretable classification rules.

Decentralised nonlinear control with disturbance rejection for on-ramp metering in highways	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE	The decentralised (localised) control of the traffic in a highway, which is treated as a series of subsystems with bounded interconnections, is considered. Using variable structures, a new nonlinear controller estimates the instantaneous magnitude of these interconnections and then generates a bounded continuous control law. The new controller offers the following two main advantages over previous solutions: (i) it addresses some phenomena that simpler models do not characterise and (ii) it takes into account the practical restrictions of the problem by, for example, complying with the boundedness constraint on the control effort.

Based on the data of GIS and GPS, a Vehicle Tracking process continually judges, from a road network, the most reliable path between every two successively detected locations of a certain vehicle, and then links the paths to restore the real track. Conventional works focused mostly on the driving distance and selected the shortest path as the solution. However, as is in many situations, the shortest path is not necessarily the best choice. Instead, a path with the least time expense may be more reasonable. Therefore, a new hybrid real-time Vehicle Tracking method is proposed in this paper considering comprehensively two main time-costing factors, the total driving distance and the number of traversed crossroads, using the concept of Pareto Frontier and Fuzzy Theory. Analytical experiment in Shanghai yields promising results.

The research is aimed at formulating the Joint Evacuation Destination-Route-Flow-Departure (JEDRFD) problem of a no-notice mass evacuation into a system optimal dynamic traffic assignment model. The proposed network transformation technique permits the conversion of a typical transportation planning network to an evacuation network configuration in which a hot zone, evacuation destinations, virtual super-safe node and connectors are established. Combined with a demand specification method, the JEDRFD problem is formulated as a single-destination cell-transmission-model-based linear programming model. The advantage of the proposed model compared with prior studies in the literature is that the multi-dimensional evacuation operation decisions are jointly obtained at the optimum of the JEDRFD model. The linear single-destination structure of the proposed model implies another advantage in computational efficiency. A numerical example is given to illustrate the modeling procedure and solution properties. Real-time operational issues and data requirements are also discussed.

In the United States, vehicles are typically classified into 13 classes using a methodology commonly referred to as "Scheme F". In this research, the ANN model was developed, trained, and applied to field data of vehicles. The data comprised of three vehicular features-axle spacing, number of axles per vehicle, and overall vehicle weight. The ANN reduced the classification error rate from 9.5 percent to 6.2 percent when compared to an existing classification algorithm that is not ANN-based and which uses two vehicular features for classification, that is, axle spacing and number of axles. The inclusion of overall vehicle weight as a third classification variable further reduced the error rate from 6.2 percent to only 3.0 percent. The promising results from the neural networks were used to set up new thresholds that reduce classification error rate.

New Jersey overnights bridge rehabilitation for Trenton bridges	INNOVATIONS IN BRIDGE ENGINEERING TECHNOLOGY	Proceedings and Monographs in Engineering, Water and Earth Sciences		English	Proceedings Paper	4th New York City Bridge Conference	AUG 27-28, 2007	New York, NY					The aging highway bridge continuously renewed while accommodating traffic flow. The traveling public is demanding that this rehabilitation and replacement be done more quickly to reduce congestion and improve safety. Conventional bridge reconstruction is typically on the critical path because of the sequential, labor-intensive processes of completing the foundation, the substructure, the superstructure infrastructure in the United States is being subjected to increasing traffic volumes and must be components, railings, and other accessories. Bridge systems can allow components to be fabricated off site and moved into place quickly while maintaining traffic flow. Depending on the specific site conditions, the use of prefabricated bridge systems can minimize traffic disruption, improve work-zone safety, minimize impact to the environment, improve constructability, increase quality, and lower life-cycle costs. New Jersey Department of Transportation clearly demonstrated the truth of these statements with their approach to the replacement of the superstructures of two structurally deficient bridges carrying a freeway section of Route US I through the capitol city of Trenton. The project involved completely replacing the superstructures of the two bridges with new ones designed for a 75 year life made off site and installed over three weekend shutdowns of 57 hours each. A project of this magnitude would typically take the Department approximately two years to design as a traditional deck replacement and bridge rehabilitation project. The project approach saved more than 22 months and an estimated design and construction savings, including delay-related user costs in excess of $2M. The results? An extremely happy motoring public.

The method uses the shadows underneath vehicles as the means of detecting them. The method distinguishes the size of each vehicle according to the distance between the front- and rear-tires, and also the lanes on which vehicles exist. The method has the advantage of creating and updating automatically a background image, and of estimating and updating automatically a threshold value to binarize background subtraction images in order to enhance the vehicle detection accuracy. As a result, vehicle detection can be achieved by the same algorithm both day and night. The proposed algorithm can realize a high-speed processing without complicated calculations, and a real-time vehicle detection by using a general-purpose personal computer. Experimental results by use of traffic images in fine, cloudy, rainy weather, and at night show that the vehicle detection accuracy is 94.9%.

J	Fang, FC; Pines, D				Fang, Fang Clara; Pines, David			Enhancing transportation engineering education with computer simulation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION			English	Article						simulation; traffic simulation; transportation engineering education; service-leaming project		There is relatively little emphasis on experiential learning as real-world experience in transport studies. It is difficult to apply to classroom learning because the risks and costs of experimenting with transport policies and concepts in the real world are prohibitively high. To counter this, simulation has proved to be capable of compressing time and space with great cost saving. At the University of Hartford, micro-simulation tools have been integrated into transportation engineering undergraduate courses for the first time to see how the traditional traffic engineering learning experience can be enhanced A simulation learning environment was created to help students learn the principles of simulation and then develop an intuitive understanding of traffic flow theory and advanced control strategies. Students have also worked with two traffic simulation tools, CORSIM and VISSIM, and used them to understand the interactive dynamics among driver behaviors, vehicle characteristics and advanced traffic control management strategies in urban and freeway transport networks. They could also test hypotheses about the effects of various driver behavior, land use, and network decisions on the resulting traffic levels and make decisions on improvements for the future network. As part of the learning experience offered by this course, students applied the skills and knowledge gained from the classroom to a real-life service-learning project. The project was to take the learned traffic model theories and use simulations to evaluate traffic operations along an important urban corridor in Hartford, Connecticut, in terms of the existing, future, and improved future scenarios. The study results were presented and communicated to the local public. It is believed that the technology-enhanced learning activities of the simulation can reduce the emphasis on instructor-led "chalk and talk" by enabling students to explore complex traffic modeling processes in computerized learning environments. The new learning experience also enables students to think critically about transport problems and solutions.

Model calculation of environmentally friendly traffic flows in a rapidly growing urban centre in India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENT AND POLLUTION			English	Article						transportation decision support system; GIS; GPS; environmental capacity; hydrodynamic theory; road capacity	SYSTEM; GIS	The paper highlights the application of an integrated decision support system for calculation of environmental friendly traffic flows in urban networks under different management strategies. Each proposed alternative is evaluated using a GIS and GPS environment that may, on a local basis, affect the environmental burden and contribute to pollution load in the region. For each link of the network an environmental capacity is calculated, taking into consideration the hydrodynamic theory based traffic flow dependent on the length of the road network and the average traffic volume and speed. The studied management options include center dot modifying the existing road network center dot road widening activities center dot bus bay relocation center dot construction of RUB/ROBs center dot rescheduling the work activities center dot parking management. The integrated transportation decision support system offers entirely new way of using the GIS, GPS and field survey data for model calculation of pollution load from road traffic to devise environmentally friendly traffic flows.

Heterogeneous traffic flow model for a two-lane roundabout and controlled intersection	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						traffic flow; cellular automata; minimum acceptable space	STATISTICAL PHYSICS	Moder urban traffic managment depends heavily on the effeciency of roads feature, such as controlled intersections and multi-lane roundabouts. Vehicle throughput at any such configuration is modified by traffic mix, by rules governing manoeuvrability and by driver observance, as well as by traffic density. Here, we study heterogeneous traffic flow on two-lane roads through a cellular automata model for a binary mix of long and short vehicles. Throughput is investigated for a range of arrival rates and for fixed turning rate at an intersection: maneuvers, while described in terms of left-lane driving, are completely generalisable. For a given heterogeneous distribution of vehicle type, there is a significant impact on queue length, delay times experienced and throughout at a fixed-cycle traffic light controlled two-way intersection and two-lane roundabout, when compared to the homogeneous case. As the proportion of long vehicles increases, average throughput for both configurations declines for increasing arrival rate, with avearge queue length and waiting times correspondingly increased. The effect is less -marked the two-lane roundabout, due to absence of cross-traffic delays. Nevertheless, average waiting times and queue lengths remain uniformly high for arrival rates > 0.25 vehicles per second (900 vph) on entry roads and for long vehicle proportion above 0.30-0.35.

Crash prone conditions on the freeway mainline and ramps were identified using loop detector data, then intelligent transportation systems (ITS) strategies to reduce the crash risk in real-time are proposed. Separate logistic regression models for assessing the risk of crashes occurring under two speed regimes were estimated. The results show that the variables in the two models are consistent with probable mechanisms of crashes under the respective regimes (high-to-moderate and low speed). This study also discusses the analysis of parameters and conditions that affect crash occurrence on freeway ramps by type (on-/off-ramp) and configurations (diamond, loop, etc.) using five-minute traffic flow data obtained from the loop detectors upstream and downstream of ramps to reflect actual traffic conditions prior to the time of crashes. Finally, several traffic management strategies are evaluated for the resulting traffic safety improvement in real-time using PARAMICS microscopic traffic simulation and the measures of crash potential determined through the logistic regression models. The results show that, while variable speed limit strategies reduced the crash potential under moderate-to-high speed conditions, ramp metering strategies were effective in reducing the crash potential during the low-speed conditions.

J	Abdel-Aty, M; Pande, A				Abdel-Aty, Mohamed; Pande, Anurag			Crash data analysis: Collective vs. individual crash level approach	JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH			English	Article						traffic safety; crash data analysis; black-spots; crash frequency; real-time crash likelihood	SEVERITY LEVELS; TRAFFIC FLOW; FREEWAY; SAFETY; GEOMETRICS; ACCIDENTS	Introduction: Traffic safety literature has traditionally focused on identification of location profiles where "more crashes are likely to occur" over a period of time. The analysis involves estimation of crash frequency and/or rate (i.e., frequency normalized based on some measure of exposure) with geometric design features (e.g., number of lanes) and traffic characteristics (e.g., Average Annual Daily Traffic [AADT]) of the roadway location. In the recent past, a new category of traffic safety studies has emerged, which attempts to identify locations where a "crash is more likely to occur." The distinction between the two groups of studies is that the latter group of locations would change based on the varying traffic patterns over the course of the day or even within the hour. Method: Hence, instead of estimation of crash frequency over a period of time, the objective becomes real-time estimation of crash likelihood. The estimation of real-time crash likelihood has a traffic management component as well. It is a proactive extension to the traditional approach of incident detection, which involves analysis of traffic data recorded immediately after the incident. The units of analysis used in these studies are individual crashes rather than counts of crashes. Results: In this paper, crash data analysis based on the two approaches, collective and at individual crash level, is discussed along with the advantages and shortcomings of the two approaches.

Our goal is to create a probabilistic model of traffic flows on highway networks that is realistic from the point of applications and at the same time supports efficient learning and inference. We study several multivariate probabilistic models and analyze their respective strengths. To balance accuracy and efficiency, we propose a novel learning model, mixture of Gaussian trees, and show its advantages in learning and inference. All models are evaluated on real-world traffic flow data from highways of the Pittsburgh area.

A Study on the Introduction of the Dual-ring Traffic Signal Control for Mitigating Traffic Impacts	MODSIM 2007: INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION: LAND, WATER AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT: INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR SUSTAINABILITY			English	Proceedings Paper	International Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM07)	DEC 10-13, 2007	Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND	Lincoln Univ, HEMA Consulting Pty Ltd, Modelling and Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand (MSSANZ), Univ Canterbury, SGI, Lincoln Ventures Ltd, Hoare Res Software Ltd, IMACS, IEMSS, Environm Modelling & Software, IBM		Dual-ring; signal-control; VISSIM; delay-time; demand-distribution		Motor vehicles provide us mobility and convenience but at the cost of chronic traffic congestion, accidents and air pollution. Improved traffic-management systems, particularly the traffic-signal control system that can directly control traffic flows would mitigate these problems. The most popular signal-control systems assign two phases per signal cycle. These conventional signal-control systems have been unchanged for the past few decades. We focus on signal phases and propose a dual-ring signal-control system that assigns signal phase more dynamically than conventional systems. A dual-ring signal-control is a kind of vehicle-actuated signal-control system that determines the timing of each of the eight different vehicle movements at an intersection. The eight different vehicle movements in the intersection that do not cross mutually consist of four phases for straight and left-turn vehicles and four right turn phases. A simple example is shown in Figure 1. Phases 1 through 4 and phases 5 through 8 are the members of ring 1 and ring 2, respectively. Phase change sequentially within ring 1 and ring 2 (i.e., phase 1, phase 2, phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5, phase 6, phase 7, phase 8, respectively). [GRAPHICS] The road network as shown in Figure 2 is used to show the superiority of the dual-ring signal control system. The traffic volume for minor road and right-turn rate for northbound vehicles is subject to change in order to check sensitivity and effects. Signal-phase splits were calculated every six minutes based on the detected traffic volume. The dual-ring signal control would become more effective utilizing dynamic traffic flow data. Two methods were compared for determining signal-phase splits. They are: the demand-rate distribution method and the total-delay minimization method. Simulation experiments were done using the microscopic traffic simulator 'VISSIM' in order to compare the conventional signal and the proposed dual-ring signal controls. The following results were observed: 1) The dual-ring signal control system can reduce the delay time more effectively than a conventional signal-control system. 2) The total-delay-minimization method is more effective than the demand-rate distribution method within an intersection that has heavy, unbalanced traffic volume with high right-turning ratios.

Automakers are trying to make vehicles more intelligent by embedding processors which can be used to implement Electronic and Control Software (ECS) for taking smart decisions on the road or assisting the driver in doing the same. These ECS applications are high-integrity, distributed and real-time in nature. Inter-Vehicle Communication and Road-Vehicle Communication (IVC/RVC) mechanisms will only add to this intelligence by enabling distributed implementation of these applications. Our work studies one such application, namely Automatic Merge Control System, which ensures safe vehicle maneuver in the region where two roads intersect. We have discussed two approaches for designing this system both aimed at minimizing the Driving-Time-To-Intersection (DTTI) of vehicles, subject to certain constraints for ensuring safety. We have (i) formulated this system as an optimization problem which can be solved using standard solvers and (ii) proposed an intuitive approach namely, Head of Lane (HoL) algorithm which incurs less Computational overhead compared to optimization formulation. Simulations carried out using Matlab and C++ demonstrate that the proposed approaches ensure safe vehicle maneuvering at intersection regions. In this ongoing work, we are implementing the system on robotic vehicular platforms built in our lab.

The model is characterized by a choice of a particular optimal velocity function which is related to each individual driver. The aim is to investigate oscillatory solutions to the model. Nevertheless, these solutions may not be physical. The analysis shows that a trajectory becomes non physical since an event which can be interpreted as a collision with the preceding car. At that moment, the natural action of a driver would be to overtake the slower car. In [1], we proposed a model of the overtaking. We will present an equivalent formulation of the overtaking maneuver: Introducing new state variables, we formulate our model as a Filippov system i.e., ordinary differential equations with discontinuous righthand sides. As a case study, we investigate typical oscillatory patterns of three cars. The objective is to continue the patterns with respect to a parameter.

Methodologically, we provide a better understanding of the relationship between highway capacity and its number of lanes upon the statistical analysis of the survey The empirical research is validated upon the extensive field survey of traffic flow in Beijing and Shanghai. The findings show that average capacity per lane decreases significantly as the number of lanes increases. Moreover, it indicated that the increase of lane-changing activity and its associated disturbance to traffic stream is the principal factor of the decrease of average capacity per lane on highways. The implication of the marginal decrease requires that the manuals of highway capacity should be revised for the better plan and design of road network. In addition, the factor of the decrease should be incorporated into the decision on adding lanes or constructing a new parallel road when travel demand exceeds road capacity.

In course of study, we constructed some reasonable lane-changing rules to analyze the special traffic flow characteristics, affected by parameters of traffic volume and inflow rate, which based on setting up, The results showed that there was a slight disturbance with the inflow to mainline flow at the moment of little probability of the inflow. However, with the inflow probability increasing, the mainline flow would be suffered from a serious disturbance. Especially, traffic jam could be produced when the mainline and on-ramp volumes increasing to a certain level: But for the outflow, the cases are completely-different, mainline exit section will be at the phase of saturation when the inflow probability exceeding 0.5.

ProbTFM works with existing traffic flow management tools and provides probabilistic data modeling and decision making. ProbTFM forecasts airport and airspace capacity and demand; and airport, airspace, and route congestion. ProbTFM creates a list of high congestion, "critical" flights and recommends delays or reroutes for specific flights. ProbTFM can be used as an evaluation platform for advanced traffic flow management concepts, and to model today's National Airspace System. In this paper we report on validation results and how ProbTFM can be used to understand operational tradeoffs and inform policy decisions.

The freeway traffic flow dynamic model is first built. Then the ramp control objective is determined. According to nonlinear feedback principle, a self-adaptation PID ramp controller based on single neuron is designed, and an improved algorithm is used to obtain the weight values. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. The result shows that the controller designed has strong robustness, fast response, and good dynamic and steady-state performance.

Since traffic flow has the property of periodicity and randomicity, a new short-tern traffic flow predication model based on support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. the parameter performance of SVM for regression estimation, the parameter of SVM is optimized by an improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO). The IPSO uses the dynamic best inertia weight and acceleration coefficient, which avoids the PSO plunging into local optima and make it converge faster. As the proposed model can reduce the dimensionality of data space and preserve features of traffic flow time series, it. can predict traffic flow efficiently. The simulation results of traffic flow collected from Chinese national highway G 107 show that the IPSO-SVM has greater efficiency and better performance than PSO-SVM. The average predication error is 3.3%, which proves the proposed model's validity.

Based on the mechanism of B-cell cooperating with T-cell exhibited in biological special immune, an artificial immune control method is proposed, and is applied to freeway on-ramp metering. First, the freeway traffic flow model is built. Then the mechanism of a biological immune system is formulated. In conjunction with the feedback control theory, a freeway on-ramp metering is realized by using artificial immune controller. Finally, the control system is simulated in MATLAB software. Fuzzy logic on-ramp controller is also chosen in contrast to the artificial immune controller. The result shows that the artificial immune controller improves evidently on the aspects of response speed and dynamic performance. This method provides a novel and practical way to realize freeway on-ramp metering.

Over the last three decades, combined traffic signal control and route guidance (CTSCRG) has been research emphasis. Firstly, the conceptual structure and definition of CTSCRG was analyzed. Then, the mathematical models of CTSCRG were summarized. Link travel time function and signal control policy have significant influence on solution uniqueness and convergence of CTSCRG model. Simulation-based method can allow more complex interactions, therefore win in reality value than travel time formula. The paper combines Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with cellular automata simulation to calculate travel time and optimize signal setting plan.

Traffic-flow impact of toll booths on M50 motoway, Dublin	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						roads & highways; transport planning		The M50 was opened to traffic in 1990. In the intervening years the daily volumes have increased dramatically, and are predicted to exceed 90 000 by 2006. In recent times the motorway has been repeatedly congested, both during weekdays and at weekends. There is at present a perception among motorists, reinforced by political and media comment, that existing delays and congestion along the M50 are caused primarily by the operation of the toll booths at the West-Link toll bridge, located at the centre point of Dublin's M50 C-Ring motorway. This paper examines the validity of this assertion, and highlights other capacity constraints within the link that may provide more plausible and technically robust explanations for the delays experienced by motorists in the vicinity of the toll plaza.

Though the state of the art focuses on data analysis, little is done in the sense of prediction. In this paper, we describe a machine learning system for traffic flow management and control for a prediction of traffic flow problem. This new algorithm is obtained by combining Random Forests algorithm into Adaboost algorithm as a weak learner. We show that our algorithm performs relatively well on real data, and enables, according to the Traffic Flow Evaluation model, to estimate and predict whether there is congestion or not at a given time on road intersections.

Modeling Highway Congestion Index for a Developing Country: The Iran Experience	SCIENTIA IRANICA			English	Article								This paper describes an attempt to develop congestion indices for a developing country with a limited sampling. Speed and flow rate information was collected from urban highway traffic flow videotaping in Iran. Video display provided information for traffic modeling when, similar to most of the developing nations, Iran does not have locally developed highway capacity manuals. Processing of the extracted data and traffic modeling provided free and capacity flow information for the selected freeway and principal arterial sections for the capital city of Tehran. The congestion indices were associated, in simple and logical models, with five traffic descriptive variables of travel speed, travel rate, delay rate, travel rate ratio and delay ratio, respectively. To calibrate the congestion index models, specific congestion levels were assessed by the index values under free and capacity flow conditions. The functional forms used in congestion index modeling were derived from the congestion rate of change, simple, reasonable and relevant assumptions. For comparison, index models, based on the US Highway Capacity Manual, HCM, speed and flow rate information, were also developed. The developed indices were suggested as feasible and included quick response measures for congestion monitoring and control when traffic management resources are often limited and scarce. Based on the preferences of a group of transportation professionals and university students, the relative importance of each of the individual indices, as average weighting value, was identified. Using the average weighting values, an overall congestion index was also developed. The overall congestion index was suggested as a complimentary or alternative measure for congestion intensity assessment and evaluation. The study findings were based on a rather limited database and were location specific; nevertheless, for quick response congestion index development, the applied methodology could be used by any developing country. The suggested indices have potential in traffic management and congestion mitigation.

Chaos theory analysis of a cable-stayed bridge: Part I - Finite element model development	SENSORS AND SMART STRUCTURES TECHNOLOGIES FOR CIVIL, MECHANICAL, AND AEROSPACE SYSTEMS 2007, PTS 1 AND 2	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Sensors and Smart Structures Technologies for Civil, Mechanical and Aerospace Systems	MAR 19-22, 2007	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Amer Soc Mech Engineers		cable-stayed bridge; chaos theory analysis; nonlinear vibration; system invariants; dynamics simulation		Cable-stayed bridges can exhibit large amplitude irregular stay cable oscillations under certain conditions of combined traffic flow and rain-wind loads that can pose severe risks to structural integrity. To investigate the mechanisms causing this behavior, a high fidelity nonlinear finite element model of a typical cable-stayed bridge has been developed using LS-DYNA based on the design of the Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge at Cape Girardeau, MO. The model uses over 540,000 finite elements representing 1254 bridge components to fully describe the detailed real geometry of the bridge tower, deck, stay cables, edge girders and floor-beam support girders. Traffic loads on the bridge deck are simulated by a Poisson Distributed Pulse (PDP) stochastic process model involving multi-lane traffic flows of more than 300 vehicles of various axle loads with varying arrival rates. The response data sets generated by the LS-DYNA simulations were then analyzed for chaotic behavior with the software CTBR. This extracts the nonlinear system invariants, the Lyapunov exponents, to identify the chaotic behavior from the dynamics of the structural system. The simulations showed positive Lyapunov exponents at various locations of the bridge deck and the bridge stay cable network. The analysis of these results revealed that even in the absence of strong rain-wind excitations the bridge deck vibration exhibits significant chaotic behavior that could excite the stay cables into a stronger chaotic regime, especially at the upper portion of the networked stay cables. This illustrates a phenomenon often ignored or unable to be captured by conventional linear dynamics analysis. Analysis of actual data sets collected from a monitoring network on the bridge also confirmed this chaotic behavior.

First, we describe the crossing set, i. e., the set of frequencies where the characteristic roots may cross the imaginary axis as the parameters change. Then, we describe the corresponding stability crossing curves, i. e., the set of parameters such that there is at least one pair of characteristic roots on the imaginary axis. Such stability crossing curves divide the parameter space R-+(2) defined by the mean delay and the gap into different regions. Within each such region, the number of characteristic roots on the right half complex plane is fixed. This naturally describes the regions of parameters where the system is stable. The classi. cation of the stability crossing curves is also discussed. Some illustrative examples (Cushing equation in biology, traffic flow models in transportation systems, and control over networks of a simplified helicopter model) are also presented.

Admissibility of a wide cluster solution in "anisotropic" higher-order traffic flow models	SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Aw and Rascle model; hyperbolic conservation law; wide cluster; shock wave; Rankine-Hugoniot condition	NONOSCILLATORY NUMERICAL SCHEME; KINEMATIC WAVES; CONTINUUM MODEL; PARAMETERS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION	We analytically investigate a wide cluster solution and show that it is not admitted in some of the traffic flow models in the literature. For those traffic flow models that admit the wide cluster solution, the relationship between two important control parameters and the critical densities that divide an equilibrium solution into stable and unstable regions is thoroughly discussed in detail. We find that such wide clusters exist with a free traffic density in an unstable region, and with one or three critical densities. These results are different from the cases in the well-known higher-order traffic flow models of Payne and Whitham [H. J.

In the literature, the delayed reactions of the drivers are modeled with discrete delays, which assume that drivers make their control decisions based on the stimuli they receive from a point of time in the history. We improve this model by introducing a distribution of delays, which assumes that the control actions are based on information distributed over an interval of time in history. Such an assumption is more realistic, as it takes into consideration the memory capabilities of the drivers and the inevitable heterogeneity of their delay times. We calculate exact stability regions in the parameter space of some realistic delay distributions. Case studies are provided demonstrating the application of the results.

They are fast and accurate, however measure only instantaneous velocity not speed of the traffic flow. Therefore they are not suitable to help determine the busy degree of traffic. A novel method of traffic flow speed measurement using video based on time domain cross correlation is introduced. It provides flow speed', a much better parameter determining whether there is a traffic jam or how fast one can cover that road under the observed situation. With regard to the 'False-Peak' problem, effect of the sequence length on correlation result is presented, together with formulas used to calculate proper sequence length both accurately and approximately. Test results demonstrate the signification of sequence length on improving cross correlation result and good accuracy suitable for estimation of road busy degree.

Comparison of numerical simulations of chaotic behavior in structural health monitoring of cable-stayed bridge with field data	STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING 2007: QUANTIFICATION, VALIDATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION, VOLS 1 AND 2	Structural Health Monitoring		English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Workshop on Structural Health Monitoring	SEP 11-13, 2007	Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA	AF Off Sci Res, Army Res Off, Natl Sci Fdn, Off Naval Res	Stanford Univ			The recent opening of the Bill Emerson Memorial Bridge at Cape Girardeau, MO provided a rare opportunity to compare numerical simulations of a nonlinear finite element bridge computer model with actual field monitoring data sets of the bridge's initial condition using advanced chaos theory analysis. The high fidelity nonlinear finite element model of the bridge was developed using LS-DYNA and uses over 540,000 finite elements to fully describe the detailed real geometry of the bridge tower, deck, stay cables, edge girders and floor-beam support girders. Complex traffic loads on the bridge deck are simulated by a PDP (Poisson Distributed Pulse) stochastic process involving multi-lane traffic flows of vehicles of various axle loads with varying arrival rates. The field data sets were collected by a network of 66 accelerometers installed in the deck and the towers for seismic monitoring purposes. The response data sets from both the LS-DYNA simulations and field monitoring data were analyzed for nonlinear behavior with the software CTBR developed by TFRHC/FHWA. This extracts the nonlinear system invariants, the Lyapunov exponents, to identify the chaotic behavior and its distribution pattern from the dynamics of the structural system. The results showed positive Lyapunov exponents at various locations of the bridge deck and the networked stay cables indicating chaotic behavior. The comparison of the normalized Lyapunov exponent spectra from the simulations against the field data showed very good agreement. The analysis also revealed that even in the absence of strong rain-wind excitations the bridge deck vibrations exhibit significant chaotic behavior that could excite the stay cables into a stronger chaotic regime, especially at the upper portion of the networked stay cables. This illustrates the potential "hot-spots" of structural damage due to the critical nonlinear behavior in general cable-stayed bridges.	[Livingston, R.

A new damage index based on the spatial curvature shape is defined to estimate the location and extend of damage. Numerical simulation shows the method is reliable and effective to assess the condition of highway bridges. The results also show the operating vehicle loads could be utilized to reduce the required number of sensors. The proposed method has the potential of detecting, damages using vehicle response of highway bridges with small number of sensors and without interrupting the traffic flow.

There is a fix duration for which the red & green signals used to open and close and it remains same for almost all times of day whether the roads have heavy traffic or low. There is no real time timing calculation. Because of this situation the traffic is not so properly adjusted and handled on the roads. We have developed a new and relatively easier method for image processing of traffic. To monitor traffic flows is nonew; this research is examining the integration of digital video and image processing to improve the transport system and try to reduce the traffic jams. A technique has been developed to process the digital data, in real time, to estimate traffic density directly from the video images. The algorithm is capable of d etecting vehicles and calculates traffic density, using image processing techniques. We have named the application as "IntelliSig", Intelligent Signals.

More precisely, we consider a single conservation law, deduced from the conservation of the number of cars, defined on a road network that is a collection of roads with junctions. The evolution problem is underdetermined at junctions, hence we choose to have some fixed rules for the distribution of traffic plus an optimization criteria for the flux. We prove existence of solutions to the Cauchy problem and we show that the Lipschitz continuous dependence by initial data does not hold. Our method is based on wave front tracking approach, see [4].

Approach to critical link analysis of robustness for dynamical road networks	TRAFFIC AND GRANULAR FLOW ' 05			English	Proceedings Paper	6th International Conference on Traffic and Granular Flow	OCT 10-12, 2005	Humboldt Univ, Berlin, GERMANY	German Res Soc, Technol Fdn Berlin, German Aerosp Ctr	Humboldt Univ			This article presents a study of the performance decrease caused by blocking one link. We predict which types of links are important for the well functioning of the network as a whole. Traffic is simulated on a regional network in which the links are blocked sequentially. Each of these outcomes is compared to the outcome of the fully operational network. We argue that traffic dynamics including spillback are important in the reduction of performance. We assessed the performance decrease for two situations, one in which people stick to their everyday routes and one in which they will adapt their routes to the new situation. A blocking of motorways turns out to influence the traffic flow most. In the situation that people stick to their everyday routes, urban roads close to the motorway are equally important: spillback effects causes delays also for through traffic on the motorway.

Notwithstanding that both of these phenomena are incompatible with classical kinematic-wave models (KWMs) of traffic flow, sufficiently coarsely time-aggregated CA-184s2ss simulations are shown to be approximated modestly well by the KWM, with a single suitable empirically determined capacity at the bottleneck.

This is shown using a hybrid representation of traffic flow where lane-changing vehicles are treated as discrete particles with realistic accelerations embedded in a continuous multilane kinematic wave stream. We show that this parsimonious four-parameter model reproduces the three phases identified by Kerner, including phase transitions and jam formation. We conclude that synchronized flow and wide-moving jams differ only in their lane-changing spatiotemporal patterns, but obey the same conservation laws and boundary conditions.

We apply our meta-model to several car-following models and simulate traffic breakdowns in open systems with an on-ramp bottleneck. Single-vehicle data generated by 'virtual detectors' show a semi-quantitative agreement with microscopic data from the Dutch freeway A9. This includes the observed distributions of the net time headways and times-to-collisions for free and congested traffic, and the velocity variance as a function of traffic density. Macroscopic properties such as the observed wide scattering of flow-density data are reproduced as well, even for deterministic simulations. We explain these phenomena by a self-organized variance-driven process that leads to the spontaneous formation and decay of long-lived platoons.

Parameters are chosen throughout for which all uniform flows are linearly stable, and a simple model for a bottleneck is used in which the OV function is scaled down on a subsection of the road. The large-time behaviour of this system is stationary and it is shown that there are three types of macroscopic traffic pattern, each consisting of plateaus joined together by sharp fronts. These patterns solve simple flow and density balances, which in some cases have non-unique solutions. It is shown how the theory of characteristics for the classical Lighthill-Whitham PDE model may be used to explain qualitatively which solutions the OV model selects. However, fine details of the OV model solution structure may only be explained by higher order PDE modelling.	[Ward, Jonathan; Wilson, R.

At the crossing real-time traffic information is displayed and drivers determine the driving direction based on the information about the trip-tirne. The traffic flow and density of the cars on the roads oscillate between free flow and jam states, and their time-behavior is chaotic. The real-time traffic information lures the driver to a road with shorter trip-time and causes too much concentration of the traffic by the nonlinearity of the velocity-density relation.

In general it looks like a line of vehicles, going one after another. Kinetic theory, used in this paper describes traffic flow system as a straight unbroken line with limited flow speed and concentration. Such model also gives the opportunity to derive traffic lines intersections.

In general it looks like a line of vehicles, going one after another. Kinetic theory, used in this paper describes traffic flow system as a straight unbroken line with limited flow speed and concentration. Such model also gives the opportunity to derive traffic lines intersections. For example, intersection could be derived like point with traffic lines coming and outgoing from this point by only changing boundary conditions.

J	Brilon, W; Geistefeldt, J; Zurlinden, H				Brilon, Werner; Geistefeldt, Justin; Zurlinden, Hendrik			Implementing the concept of reliability for highway capacity analysis	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								A stochastic concept for highway capacity analysis is presented. The capacity of a highway facility is regarded as a random variable instead of a constant value. Thus, the stochastic approach provides new measures of traffic flow performance based on aspects of traffic reliability. A method for the estimation of capacity distribution functions from empirical data based on statistical methods for lifetime data analysis is introduced. This method is derived for the analysis of freeway capacity. However, the stochastic approach also is shown to be applicable to intersections. Results of the analysis of data samples from freeway sections in Germany indicate that freeway capacity is Weibull-distributed with a considerable variance. A Monte Carlo technique based on the stochastic description of capacity is proposed to quantify freeway traffic performance over a whole year. This technique also provides a quantitative assessment for oversaturated conditions.

Mixed traffic flow in anisotropic continuum model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							HIGHWAY; WAVES	An extended speed gradient model is developed to study the mixed traffic flow of two types of vehicles with different velocities and different lengths. Two new terms, representing the reaction of one type of vehicle to the other, are proposed and built into the dynamic speed evolution equations for fast cars and slow vehicles. With the developed model, the relation between the steady-state behavior of the mixed traffic flow system and two system parameters is analyzed, including the number density ratio R of the fast cars to the total vehicles and the vehicle length ratio alpha of the slow vehicle to the fast car. The formation and propagation of traffic jams, the dissolution process of the jams, and the local cluster effect of the mixed traffic system are also studied. The simulation results are reasonable and consistent with daily experience.	[Tang, C. F.; Jiang, R.; Wu, Q.

The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints, assuming that travel demands belong to an ellipsoidal likelihood region and that traffic flows on the underlying network are in user equilibrium. The proposed algorithm obtains a solution by solving a sequence of problems. Numerical results from the nine-node and Sioux Falls networks demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to produce a solution that guarantees the future system performance without requiring an excessive amount of investment.

The model extends the theoretical capacity formula for shared and short lanes at unsignalized intersections (previously introduced by the author) to signalized intersections. The model accounts for the stochastic nature of traffic flow and the effect of queue blockage on the short turn lanes. The VisSim simulation package was used to generate a comprehensive database for model calibration under different lane and signal-control conditions. The proposed model can be used for arbitrary lane and signal-timing configurations. Explicit equations are given for signalized intersections with simple shared- and short-lane configurations. Detailed monographs are prepared for practical applications.

Travis			Integrated traffic simulation-statistical analysis framework for online prediction of freeway travel time	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; PROBE-VEHICLE DATA	This paper introduces a novel approach to the online short-term prediction of point-to-point freeway travel time, combining statistical forecasting techniques with traffic simulation. At every freeway entrance point, a time series analysis model based on traffic detector counts is used to predict traffic demands, whose flow through the freeway segment is simulated by a cell transmission model. This procedure, applied within a rolling-horizon framework, generates online travel time predictions consistent with traffic flow theory. Experimental results obtained from synthetic data strongly suggest that the estimates obtained with this methodology are robust and accurate. For a wide range of congestion conditions and freeway segment lengths, more than half of the predictions errors were found to be smaller than 15%. Moreover, 80% of these errors fell below 40 s when the actual travel times ranged between 3 and 10 min. Further analyses of the model sensitivity to traffic detector coverage revealed that detector separations of approximately 1 mi resulted in the most precise travel time estimates. In addition to its satisfactory performance, the proposed framework is flexible, and it can make use of additional online data and easily incorporate different forecasting and simulation techniques. Therefore, this work provides a powerful tool for online travel time prediction, suitable for a variety of practical implementation conditions and requirements.	[Waller, S.

J	Murray-Tuite, PM				Murray-Tuite, Pamela M.			Optimizing protective measures with respect to multiple hazards	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								In the past century, more than a thousand attacks targeted the transportation system or used it as a weapon. In the latter case, terrorists transformed the transportation system into a delivery system for vehicular bombs targeting structural assets. The most effective protection against this threat is the erection of barriers to create sufficient distance between the asset and the avenue of attack. However, these barriers often impede traffic flow and degrade evacuation and other emergency response times. Thus, although they reduce a network's risk from one type of event, the protective measures increase risk from other hazards. This paper examines the trade-offs between protective measures that limit vehicle access to structures and the benefits of a fully operational transportation system in evacuation scenarios. A framework containing a linear integer program is presented to select optimally a vector of active and passive security measures while ensuring emergency transportation connectivity and mobility, a sufficient benefit-cost ratio, budget compliance, and workforce availability. Application of the framework to a sample network indicated that the protective measures induced more risk than they alleviated. These results are specific to the network and scenarios evaluated.

Study of freeway speed limit control based an three-phase traffic theory	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							FLOW; MODEL; HIGHWAY; DYNAMICS; STATES; WAVES	Speed limit control at freeway bottlenecks is numerically studied on the basis of the Kerner-Klenov microscopic stochastic traffic flow model in the context of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory. It turns out that in some cases speed limit control, rather than preventing traffic breakdown, leads to induced congested pattern emergence at the bottleneck, whereas there is free flow at the bottleneck without speed limitation. In other cases, speed limit control can suppress moving jam emergence, which occurs without speed limitation. It is found that these effects are associated with the probabilistic character of traffic breakdown at a bottleneck as well as with complex spatiotemporal congested pattern features.

J	Tian, Z; Urbanik, T; Gibby, R				Tian, Zong; Urbanik, Thomas, II; Gibby, Reed			Application of diamond interchange control strategies at closely spaced intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Signalized diamond interchanges are one of the most common interchange types in U.S. urban areas. Special signal control strategies have been developed for diamond interchanges to address their unique traffic flow and geometric characteristics such as tight spacing and one-way cross streets. The application of diamond interchange signal control strategies on a site consisting of six closely spaced intersections in Reno, Nevada, is documented. These intersections represent or closely resemble a standard diamond interchange. Advance control strategies are derived on the basis of diamond interchange signal control schemes. Simulation results of the timing strategies indicate significant reductions in the number of stops; however, no significant change is found for overall travel time and delay for the study site. Because the proposed control strategies emphasize maximum progression between closely spaced paired signals, the external approaches normally experience increased delay and stops. The proposed control is considered more efficient than the existing control because of significant reduction in stops and much improved driving experience and drivers' expectations. Public reaction to the new timings has been positive. Similar applications could be easily adopted at other locations with similar site characteristics. The proposed control enhances the knowledge of traffic signal control and coordination for closely spaced intersections.

Log truck transportation an public roads in New Zealand - Regional network analysis with geographic information systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Industrial forestry within the Southland region of New Zealand is forecast to double over the next 20 years as the availability of wood from production forest plantations increases dramatically. This is generating unprecedented pressure on the public road network. An issue has arisen between goveZment and industry over which should pay for the increasing road upgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance costs generated by the burgeoning traffic, with the Southland Regional Council proposing a fourfold increase in the road-related rates (tax) charged to the forest industry. In an effort to produce an independent model of the forest industry's use of the road system, regional spatial data sets characterizing the wood supply, demand for wood, and road network were assembled and verified. The transportation geographic information system software package TransCAD was then used to determine the optimum distribution pattern for Southland's wood production. It was confirmed that an accurate model of the current transportation of wood in the region had been created. Distribution patterns under four input scenarios were analyzed. For domestic sawlogs, rearranging supply contracts was predicted to provide transportation savings, measured in annual tonne-kilometers, of just under 40%. On the other hand, there appeared to be no gains to be made in using unconstrained haul routes-the routes in current use are near the optimum. The predictive power of the model was illustrated for the case of chip logs, in which significant changes in traffic patterns were predicted for the 2009 harvest year, along with an order-of-magnitude increase in traffic volumes. The work revealed that the origin of the fourfold rate increase to be charged to forestry is in an arbitrary "perceived damage factor" applied to the numerically modeled traffic flows.

J	Lee, JS; Kim, TJ				Lee, Jong Sung; Kim, Tschangho John			Implementation of spatiotemporal model for infrastructure reconstruction strategy under large-scale disaster	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION NETWORK; ECONOMIC-IMPACTS; SHIPMENTS; DESIGN	The reconstruction strategy chosen to repair damaged transportation network infrastructure after an unscheduled event is important in returning the disrupted economy to the status preceding the event. Furthermore, the strategy determines how fast the national economy will recover. Previous research has shown how damage to the transportation network has significant direct and indirect impacts on the national economy. The optimal sequence or priority for reconstruction of damaged links must be developed to restore the economy quickly. Common issues from the previous research on finding the optimal reconstruction strategy are (a) lack of consideration of the national economic impact, (b) lack of integration of the traffic flow and commodity flow models, and (c) lack of consideration of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the economy. To overcome these issues, this paper suggests a spatiotemporal model for finding the optimal reconstruction strategy after an unscheduled event based on an earlier model. The paper discusses the framework for finding the optimal reconstruction strategy by using the spatiotemporal analysis model for a posteriori unscheduled event (STAM-2).

J	Kim, DK; Park, CH; Kim, TJ				Kim, Dong Kyu; Park, Chang Ho; Kim, Tschangho John			Single allocation hub network design model with consolidated traffic flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM; LOCATION PROBLEM; FACILITIES; ECONOMIES; SEARCH; SCALE	Economies of scale achieved by consolidating traffic flows are fundamental characteristics of hub networks. In the hub network design problem, then, it is particularly important to quantify cost savings stemming from economies of scale, the operating costs of hub facilities, and the opportunity costs of delays in hub facilities. Because of the NP (nondeterministic polynomial time)-complete nature of the hub network design problem, most previous researchers have focused on the development of heuristic algorithms for approximate solutions. The purpose of this paper is to develop a hub network design model considering economies of scale stemming from consolidation of traffic flows. The model is designed to determine endogenously the cost-decreasing effect resulting from economies of scale and to include several cost components and capacity constraints relative to the particularity of hub networks. The model in this paper is compared with recently published studies using real data. The results of the analysis show that the proposed model can provide a more reliable and realistic representation of real hub networks. This study can not only form the theoretical basis of an effective and rational hub network design but also contribute to the assessment of existing and planned logistics systems.

J	Hoogendoorn, SP; Schreuder, M; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, S				Hoogendoorn, Serge P.; Schreuder, Marco; Hoogendoorn-Lanser, Sascha			Calibrating dynamic network models for traffic operator decision support	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								To support traffic operators in regional traffic management centers with their network control tasks, the Traffic Research Center of the Dutch Ministry of Transportation has proposed a two-step scenario-based approach. In the first step, traffic engineers prepare candidate traffic control scenarios that are likely to resolve problems that occur in real-world network traffic operations. In the second step, network operators can try out a limited number of control scenarios with an online prediction system to see which of these best resolves the problems at hand. To prepare the scenarios, a scenario assessment system is used that predicts the impacts of a specific control scenario by using a dynamic network traffic flow model (MetaNet). The development of a fully automated calibration approach for the input and parameters of this macroscopic network simulation model is described. The approach presented consisted of four steps-preparing inflows and turning proportions, establishing lane-specific traffic flow parameters, estimating the global simulation parameters, and determining unresolved model inputs-eventually leading to input data and a set of parameters that yield the best prediction of networkwide traffic conditions. Furthermore, the approach checks the available input data for inconsistencies in terms of network configuration and measurement errors. On the basis of the application examples tested, the approach is well suited for the calibration task at hand, yielding a remarkable improvement in the prediction error.

J	Hadi, M; Sinha, P; Wang, A				Hadi, Mohammed; Sinha, Prasoon; Wang, Amy			Modeling reductions in freeway capacity due to incidents in microscopic simulation models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Modeling the impacts of incidents on traffic flow operations is essential for the use of simulation programs to evaluate incident management alternatives. In particular, these programs must be able to model correctly the reductions in highway capacity that are due to incidents and the lane-changing behaviors of drivers ahead of incident locations. Although simulation models have been used for evaluating incident impacts, the abilities of these programs to model incidents have not been adequately assessed. Here the modeling of incidents in microscopic simulation models and the effects of calibration parameters on the simulated reductions in capacity due to incidents are examined. A basic freeway segment was simulated with three widely used microscopic simulation models: CorSim, VisSim, and AIMSUN. The three investigated simulation models allow the analyst to simulate incident blockages either explicitly or by using other events that have similar impacts on traffic operations at the incident locations. Calibration parameters of the three models were varied to determine if it is possible to calibrate the models to achieve target link capacity values for conditions both with and without incidents. The target capacity values used were those presented in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000, although any other target capacities could have been used. For all three models, there is a need to calibrate model parameters to produce acceptable reductions in capacity due to incidents. It is shown that this objective is possible with all investigated models. However, there is a need to introduce incident-specific time-variant calibration parameters in AIMSUN and VisSim. Recommendations are given regarding required improvements to the simulation programs to enhance their ability to model the reduction in capacity and the lane-changing behaviors at incident locations.

J	Toledo, T; Zohar, D				Toledo, Tomer; Zohar, David			Modeling duration of lane changes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	Lane changes significantly affect the characteristics of traffic flow. Lane-changing models are therefore important in microscopic traffic simulation. Existing lane-changing models emphasize the decision-making aspects of the task but generally neglect the detailed modeling of the lane-changing action itself and model it only as an instantaneous event. However, research indicates that lane-changing durations are on average in the range of 5 to 6 s. The omission of lane-changing durations from simulation models may have a significant impact on simulation outputs. Models of the duration of lane changes are presented. These models are estimated by using detailed vehicle trajectory data that were collected in naturalistic driving with high-mounted video cameras. Separate models are presented for passenger cars and for heavy vehicles and statistical tests are conducted for the similarity between the lane-change durations of the two vehicle types.

J	Jonsson, T; Ivan, JN; Zhang, C				Jonsson, Thomas; Ivan, John N.; Zhang, Chen			Crash prediction models for intersections on rural multilane highways - Differences by collision type	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Accident prediction models are often used to estimate the number of accidents on segments and at intersections in the road network. Most often the models are developed for a total number of crashes for the facility or for crashes by severity. However, the frequency and severity of crashes of different types can be expected to vary according to underlying phenomena that cause them. To account for this variation better, modeling of accidents at intersections on rural four-lane highways in California is described separately for four different collision types: opposite-direction crashes, same-direction crashes, intersecting-direction crashes, and single-vehicle crashes. The findings from this modeling are reported with a special focus on the differences in crash types by (a) severity distribution, (b) dependence on traffic flow, and (c) variables that best explain between-site variations in the occurrence of different crash types. Evident differences exist in severity as well as the relationship of flow between several of the crash types. Intersecting and opposite-direction crashes are more severe than same-direction crashes. Same- and opposite-direction crashes exhibit similar relationships with traffic flow, but there are differences compared with intersecting-direction crashes and single-vehicle crashes.In addition, the variables that turn out to be good predictor variables differ somewhat for each crash type.

J	Ossen, S; Hoogendoorn, SP				Ossen, Saskia; Hoogendoorn, Serge P.			Driver heterogeneity in car following and its impact an modeling traffic dynamics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							BEHAVIOR	A dedicated trajectory data collection method using a helicopter enabled a range of in-depth empirical studies of car-following behavior. These studies found a high degree of heterogeneity in car-following behavior; that is, drivers' driving styles turned out to be highly different because different modeling approaches were needed to model these behaviors satisfactorily. Therefore the impact of heterogeneity in car following on modeling traffic dynamics is examined to gain insight into the effect of incorporating different types and degrees of heterogeneity in car-following behavior on the dynamics of a simulated traffic flow. The microsimulation approach that was adopted focused on two case studies: the first case study focused on heterogeneity in parameter values by comparing stability results for heterogeneous platoons and homogeneous platoons, which could in fact be seen as a solid preparation for the second case study. The second study was a simulation of a fixed stretch of road on which, from a certain point on, a speed limit was imposed for the drivers. In this case study the link between the empirical results and the simulations was strengthened as several types of heterogeneity (e.g., different model specifications for different drivers and different parameter settings and combinations of them) were explored and compared with the empirically estimated parameters. Both analyses show clear differences between simulations with homogeneous drivers and simulations with heterogeneous drivers.

J	Punzo, V; Tripodi, A				Punzo, Vincenzo; Tripodi, Antonino			Steady-state solutions and multiclass calibration of Gipps microscopic traffic flow model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; SIMULATION	This study addresses the problem of calibration of the Gipps microscopic traffic flow model. The approach consists of first deriving traffic stream models, in the form of steady-state solutions of car-following models, and then fitting such models to stationary traffic data. To this end, traffic stream models for the Gipps model were first attained, and an explicit formula for the flow at capacity as a function of microscopic parameters is provided. Analysis of the models for different combinations of microscopic parameters explains the widely held belief that the Gipps model is unable to reproduce unstable traffic phenomena. To be suitable for model parameter calibration in simulation practice, single-class models were generalized to a multiclass traffic scenario for which a calibration procedure was developed. Once applied to real motorway traffic data, the multiclass scenario proved its effectiveness in terms of error statistics. Values of calibrated parameters were all significant and consistent with expectations. Moreover, they were consistent with the observed aggregate measures (e.g., flow at capacity). Finally, unlike nonstationary, model-based approaches, the computing time required by the multiclass calibration presented is negligible, allowing calibration of a large number of parameters, that is, calibration of different classes of vehicles.

J	Sluhi, S; Mussa, R				Sluhi, Saidi; Mussa, Renatus			Simulation analysis of truck-restricted and high-occupancy vehicle lanes	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Numerous studies have reported the efficacy of high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane restriction and truck lane restriction implemented independently, but the simultaneous use of both restrictions on an urban freeway corridor raises numerous operational and safety issues. This research study analyzed the operational and safety experience of an 83-mi corridor of I-95 in South Florida that has both HOV and truck lane restriction. Results of a field-validated VisSim simulation model showed that high-occupancy vehicles and automobiles gained significantly more travel time savings and speeds on the restricted lanes than on the general lanes. Also, vehicle queue lengths around critical merging and diverging areas increased significantly as the percentage of trucks increased. Results indicated that during peak traffic conditions right lanes had higher lane occupancy than left lanes, whereas during off-peak traffic conditions center lanes carried more vehicles per lane than the outermost lanes; these results suggest that congestion on right lanes forces automobiles to use left lanes. Furthermore, results showed that most lane changes occurred during peak traffic flow conditions-about twice that of off peak-and appreciable speed differences existed between restricted and nonrestricted lanes. Simulation results for off-peak traffic conditions did not show any noticeable changes in traffic operating characteristics resulting from lane restriction strategies. On the basis of these results, it can be fairly concluded that on urban freeways significant operational and safety benefits of the combined implementation of HOV and truck lane restrictions accrue during congested traffic conditions rather than during uncongested conditions.

J	Wang, H; Wang, W; Chen, XW; Chen, J; Li, J				Wang, Hao; Wang, Wei; Chen, Xuewu; Chen, Jun; Li, Jie			Experimental features and characteristics of speed dispersion in urban freeway traffic	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOW; MODEL; SIMULATION	Characteristics of speed dispersion in urban freeway traffic are presented. Two definitions of speed dispersion are proposed: the standard deviation of the individual speeds and the average speed difference of two neighboring vehicles. On the basis of the definitions, traffic data obtained from two urban freeways in China are studied, and different characteristics of speed dispersion are found in four substates; of traffic flow, which correspond to four regions in the empirical fundamental diagram. In the bunching state of congested traffic, the flow rate decreases with an increase in speed dispersion at a given mean speed. In the bunching state of fluid traffic, the speed dispersion of traffic flow is small, and in the free state of fluid traffic, speed dispersion is distributed in a disorderly manner in a wide range. Such phenomena are more remarkable under the definition of the average speed difference for speed dispersion. In addition, some possible explanations are presented for the characteristics of speed dispersion in each traffic substate. These speed dispersion studies provide a new approach for microscopic modeling and understanding of traffic flow characteristics.

In this study, we extend the algorithm to an inhomogeneous highway, in which two homogeneous sections with different fundamental diagrams are connected by a junction (interface). According to the entropy condition of the Riemann problem, the flow condition at the interface can be categorized into 4 groups, and the density at both sides of the interface can be uniquely determined. Based on the physical conditions, we construct a fictitious element as an appropriate boundary condition for each homogeneous section. Consequently, the Riemann problem of an inhomogeneous highway can be transformed into a problem of equivalent homogeneous sections, where the shock-fitting algorithm can be applied. We apply this algorithm to some representative traffic flow cases and compare them with numerical solutions that are obtained using the Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme.

However, multiclass traffic flow operations are characterized by asymmetric driving behaviour with many complex interactions between vehicle classes, which require a more relevant filtering technique for highly non-linear systems. To this end, the Uscented Kalman Filter (UKF) algorithm has been proposed as a solution for the estimation of multiclass traffic flow. This paper presents an extensive case study of a newly developed real-time multiclass traffic flow model based on the UKF algorithm. The field test is performed in freeway M25 in England, in which data of 30km (in one direction) in 12 hours is used. The obtained results show that the proposed model is very promising and applicable for the other multiclass freeway networks.

The CTM model is one of the most popular models used in computer simulation of traffic network. Its popularity is due to its simple analysis and low computation requirement. In this paper we develop a stochastic cell transmission model (SCTM) of the evolution of traffic flows on freeways. It will be aimed to be applied to on-line prediction algorithms and control strategies for large freeway networks. We model the transportation network as stochastic system by taking the variation of the demand, supply as dynamic uncertainties (random variables). The SCTM is developed using analytical probability theory and is formulated into a stochastic switched system.

These microscopic traffic simulations require vehicle movements to be modelled and calibrated. Since individual vehicles exhibit heterogeneity, the parameters within these submodels must incorporate some disturbances. However, due to limited observational data, the various parameters among individuals have not been well validated. We collected video data from a 600m section in a merging area of an urban expressway over 1 week using 11 video cameras. By tracking individual vehicles on-screen, we were able to obtain vehicle trajectories. We applied this manually obtained data to investigate individual heterogeneity of vehicle movement; in particular, we focused on car-following behaviour, analysing heterogeneity among individuals. We also examined relationships between car-following behaviour and traffic conditions, driving lanes, and road geometry.

Desired speed distribution is one of the most important factors to be considered in traffic flow analysis when the heterogeneity of drivers' driving behavior is introduced. It is impossible, however, to observe the desired speed distribution directly due to bunching phenomena. In this study, it is assumed that platoons are formed by the variety in drivers' desired speeds. Focusing on the relationship between the platoon size distribution and desired speed distribution, a bunching model is first established in relation to the desired speed distribution. Secondly, an inverse model is proposed, which estimates the desired speed distribution from the observed platoons. Finally, the validity of this method is examined by using actual datasets observed at a divided 2-lane expressway in Japan.

They are particularly suitable for modelling congested transportation networks when the demand for travel or the cost of travel is time varying. Because of the complexity of traffic flow, it is difficult to formulate an analytical type model that can use classical optimization techniques to find the user equilibrium solution and at the same time comply with various traffic flow characteristics of dynamic road networks. Therefore, most operational DTA models belong to the simulation type that use heuristic algorithms to estimate the equilibrium network conditions. A matter of concern to model users is that the solution obtained is generally not unique but depends on the number of iterations performed before stopping. As achieving perfect convergence may be difficult or impossible, it is necessary to analyze the trade-off between the level of convergence and the consistency of the model results. Since using the gap function alone may not provide sufficient information to enable the model user decide when to stop the iteration process this study suggests using the concept of "model reliability" as a stopping criterion. A mesoscopic type simulation model is deployed and an example network is used to illustrate the method.	[Tong, C.

A new multi-class continuum model for traffic flow	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						continuum model; traffic flow; heterogeneous drivers; platoon dispersion	SHOCK-WAVES	In this paper, we propose a new continuum model and study some qualitative properties. The new model contains an additional speed gradient term (anisotropic tern) in comparison to Berg's model (Berg et al., 2000, Physical Review E, 61, 1056-1066). This anisotropic term guarantees the property that the characteristic speeds can be made less than or equal to the macroscopic flow speed. We extend this model for multi-class traffic flow with heterogeneous drivers. Each user class is characterized by their choice of speeds in a traffic stream. The choice of the speed of a particular user class at any location on the highway is affected by the presence of all user class on that location. Numerical simulations show that the model is able to explain some of the observed traffic phenomena such as platoon dispersion that challenge old homogeneous models presented in the literature.

J	Spyropoulou, I				Spyropoulou, Ioanna			Simulation using Gipps ' car-following model an in-depth analysis	TRANSPORTMETRICA			English	Article						acceleration; deceleration; model properties; saturation flow; traffic model	TRAFFIC FLOW; DYNAMICS; ROADS	This study reports on an in-depth analysis of the properties of Gipps' car-following model. Certain properties of the model are investigated and the need of specific additions to the model is identified. Gipps' car-following model is rather important as it comprises the traffic model of several traffic simulation packages; and the analysis performed in this study determines the actual dynamics that govern model formulae. First, the relationships for the maximum acceleration and deceleration values the model produces are identified. Results indicate that model relationships are such that a vehicle could end up braking harder than its desired deceleration, hence a constraint has to be set. Furthermore, relationships between vehicle acceleration and speed are established. Second, further additions are proposed to allow the model simulate traffic at signal-controlled junctions. These additions include providing a definition for a queueing vehicle and speed manipulation to achieve the calculated saturation flow of simulated junctions.

Travel time cost functions for urban roads: a case study in Italy	URBAN TRANSPORT XIII: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	2007	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol		costfunction; travel time	ASSIGNMENT	Cost functions are commonly used in traffic assignment to account for the effects of congestion on road link performances. Despite their influence on assignment results, not many effective functions are available at least for urban roads. Indeed, the effects of congestion on the travel time required to cross an urban link have often been considered negligible in comparison with those on delays at intersections. Nonetheless, traffic flow disturbances like side-parking can appreciably affect link travel time with the rise in congestion, especially in the roads of ancient centres in historical cities. Hence this paper presents a travel time function for urban road links including the effect of side-parking, secondary streets and road winding on the worsening of performance due to congestion. Model parameter identification was based both on empirical and experimental data, the latter having been obtained by means of a calibrated micro-simulation model. Cross-validation results do not exclude the possibility of applying the proposed function to different urban areas.

The model simulates the section of the Chung-Sam highway between Taipei and TaoYuan in which the distance is 31.9 kilometers. We adopt dynamic speed limits and practical measures to simulate the arrival number of cars and the leaving number of cars in a time interval. First, we set each lane with the speed limit of 100 or 125 km/hr and a stop-and-go traffic light sign at the entrance ramp with 0, 5, 10, and 15 seconds. Next, by controlling the departure speed of the junction, we find that it causes a better result for enlarging the maximum flow. The simulation model with the dynamic speed limit is able to dynamically guide traffic in rush hours. Finally, the dynamically automatic traffic flow control models without a time limit barrier and with a time limit barrier at 0, 5, 10, and 15 seconds are implemented and analyzed. We find that the dynamically automatic traffic flow control model without a time limit barrier is better than that of the model with a time limit barrier.	[Yang, C.

Eco-driving simulation: evaluation of eco-driving within a network using traffic simulation	URBAN TRANSPORT XIII: URBAN TRANSPORT AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY	WIT Transactions on the Built Environment		English	Proceedings Paper	13th International Conference on Urban Transport and the Environment in the 21st Century	2007	Coimbra, PORTUGAL	Wessex Inst Technol		eco-driving; ITS; emission; CO2; traffic simulation		Curbing Global Warming necessitates the reduction of greenhouse gases. Motor-vehicle companies are attempting to improve engine efficiencies but are constrained by technical limitations. Hence we try to change driving behaviour to reduce fuel consumption. A change in driving style/habit to promote fuel efficiency and hence to reduce CO2 emissions is known as 'eco-driving'. One such eco-driving style is to reduce sudden acceleration and deceleration. A report based on eco-driving shows a 10-20% reduction in fuel consumption per vehicle; and hence, eco-driving is promoted by Japan's Ministry of Environment. However, a mass of eco-drivers might impede traffic flow which fosters traffic congestion. This study evaluates eco-driving with respect to a traffic network versus an individual vehicle. We performed field measurements of a vehicle's speed and acceleration versus normal and eco-driving styles. We input the data into a micro-traffic simulator (VISSIM, PTV AG). We built a simple road network with two signalized intersections. Ten simulations were done using different random-number seeds. We found that eco-driving increases environment load; i.e., carbon dioxide emission within the network during heavy-traffic volume. We propose an eco-driving control system and show its effectiveness.

This paper addresses the issue of how to optimize traffic throughput on highways, in particular for intersections where a ramp leads onto the highway. In our work we assume that cars are equipped with sensors: they can detect the distance to the neighboring cars and communicate their velocity and acceleration among each other. We present proactive algorithms for merging different streams of sensor-enabled cars into a single stream. A proactive merging algorithm de-couples the decision point from the actual merging point. Sensor-enabled cars allow us to decide where and when a car merges before it arrives at the actual merging point. This leads to a significant throughput improvement for the traffic as the speed can be adjusted proactively. Sensor-enabled cars can locally exchange sensed information about the traffic and adapt their behavior much earlier than regular cars. We compare the traffic merging algorithms against a conventional priority-based merging algorithm in a controlled simulation environment. We show that proactive merging algorithms outperform the priority-based merging algorithm in terms of throughput and delay. Our experiments demonstrate that the traffic throughput can be increased by up to 200% and the delay can be reduced by 30%.

This method is based on fusing traffic counts with mobile phone counts. The procedure used for the estimation of traffic flow parameters is based on the hypothesis that "instrumented" vehicles can be counted on specific motorway sections and traffic flow can be measured on entrance and exit ramps. The motorway is subdivided into cells, assuming that mobile phones entering and exiting every cell can be counted during the observation period. An estimate of "instrumented" vehicle concentration is obtained and propagated on the network in time and space. This allows one to estimate traffic flow parameters by sampling "instrumented" traffic flow parameters using a "concentration" (the ratio of the densities of instrumented vehicles to the density of overall traffic) propagation mechanism.

Integrated air quality modelling for a designated air quality management area in Glasgow	BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						built environment; natural ventilation; air quality; computational fluid dynamics	URBAN STREET CANYON; WIND-TUNNEL; POLLUTANT DISPERSION; FLOW	Currently, most local authorities in the UK use well-established Gaussian-type dispersion models to predict the air quality in urban areas. The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in integrated urban air quality modelling is still in its infancy, despite having an enormous potential in assessing and improving natural ventilation in built-up areas. This study assesses the suitability of a general CFD code (PHOENICS) for use in integrated urban air quality modelling for regulatory purposes. An urban air quality model of a designated air quality management area in the city centre of Glasgow has been developed by integrating traffic flow data for urban road networks, traffic pollutant emission data and a three-dimensional CFD dispersion model of a complex configuration of street canyons. The results are in good agreement with field measurements taken during the continuous monitoring campaign, and show that a general CFD code has indeed the potential for regulatory use. Although this numerical tool has demonstrated satisfactory performance, it is observed that small differences in monitoring station positioning may yield significant variations of the measured mean concentration, due to large values of horizontal and vertical local concentration gradients. Although, at this stage, the accuracy of the developed Glasgow urban air quality model is highly dependent on the experience of its users, it is believed that use of a CFD code (such as PHOENICS) could benefit urban planners, architects, HVAC engineers and all other professionals interested in public health.

New topologies in the fundamental diagram of a cellular automata traffic flow model	CHINESE JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL; STATES; BOUNDARIES; SIMULATION; VEHICLES; BEHAVIOR; HIGHWAY	We propose a traffic flow model in which vehicles are fixed at their maximal velocities, the fast cars run with V-max1, whereas the slow ones run with V-maz2. Using new overtaking rules which deal with the deterministic NaSch model, it is found that the fundamental diagram exhibits three new topologies, depending on the fractions f(fast) and f(slow) of fast and slow vehicles, respectively, in which the current profile displays two branches with negative slopes and two branches with positive ones. Moreover, in the second branch of the fundamental diagram, the model exhibits an absorbing phase transition in which the behaviour of the order parameter f(d) and the current J is described by power laws. In this case, it is found that the system presents a univeral scaling law. On the other hand, a simple change in the rule of overtaking induces a metastability, which depends on the state of the chain instead of the external parameters [4-6]. Furthermore, in the case of random fractions of vehicles, the fundamental diagrams are similar to the experimental results [7, 8].

Segregation effect in symmetric cellular automata model for two-lane mixed traffic	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							FLOW; SYSTEMS; RULES	Segregation effects commonly exist in granular mixtures with difference in size, shape or density. In mixed traffic flow, slow vehicle and fast vehicle, as two types of particles, have different desired speed. We investigate the segregation along the road in mixed traffic flow by using a symmetric two-lane cellular automata model. A parameter D, which quantifies the degree of segregation, is defined. We study the density dependency of the parameter at different randomization probability. Simulation results show that segregation is more obviously in free flow region. We argue that the overtaking maneuvers have similar effect as percolation in granular flow.

Effect of looking backward on traffic flow in a cooperative driving car following model	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							SIMULATION	An extended car following model is proposed by incorporating intelligent transportation system and the backward looking effect under certain condition in traffic flow. The neutral stability condition of this model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The results show that anticipating the behavior of vehicles preceding and following one vehicle could lead to appreciable stabilization of traffic system. From the simulation of space-time evolution of the vehicle headways, it is shown that the traffic jam could be suppressed efficiently via taking into account the information about the motion of two preceding vehicles and one following vehicle, and the analytical result is consistent with the simulation one.

It uses the traffic-flow simulation model MIXIC that was specially designed to study the impact of intelligent vehicles on traffic flow. The authors study the impacts of CACC for a highway-merging scenario from four to three lanes. The results show an improvement of traffic-flow stability and a slight increase in traffic-flow efficiency compared with the merging scenario without equipped vehicles.

J	Cho, Y; Rice, J				Cho, Young; Rice, John			Estimating velocity fields on a freeway from low-resolution-videos	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						traffic information systems; velocity measurement; video cameras		An algorithm to estimate velocity fields from low-resolution video recordings is presented. The algorithm does not attempt to identify and track individual vehicles, nor does it attempt to estimate derivatives of the field of pixel intensities. Rather, a frame is compressed by obtaining an intensity profile in each lane along the direction of traffic flow. The speed estimate is then computed by searching for a best matching profile in a frame at earlier and later times. It is shown that the estimate is equivalent to a weighted median of velocities of vehicles. Because the algorithm does not need high-quality images, it is directly applicable to a compressed format digital video stream, such as .mpeg, from conventional traffic video cameras. The procedure is illustrated using a 15-min-long Video Home System recording to obtain speed estimates on a 1-mi stretch of highway I-80 in Berkeley, CA.

Extracting dynamic spatial data from airborne imaging sensors to support traffic flow estimation	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						airborne laserscanning (LiDAR); airborne imagery; feature extraction; traffic flow; performance validation		The recent transition from analog to totally digital data acquisition and processing techniques in airborne surveying represents a major milestone in the evolution of spatial information science and practice. On one hand, the improved quality of the primary sensor data can provide the foundation for better automation of the information extraction processes. This phenomenon is also strongly supported by continuously expanding computer technology, which offers almost unlimited processing power. On the other hand, the variety of the data, including rich information content and better temporal characteristics, acquired by the new digital sensors and coupled with rapidly advancing processing techniques, is broadening the applications of airborne surveying. One of these new application areas is traffic flow extraction aimed at supporting better traffic monitoring and management. Transportation mapping has always represented a significant segment of civilian mapping and is mainly concerned with road corridor mapping for design and engineering purposes, infrastructure mapping and facility management, and more recently, environmental mapping. In all these cases, the objective of the mapping is to extract the static features of the object space, such as man-made and natural objects, typically along the road network. In contrast, the traffic moving in the transportation network represents a very dynamic environment, which complicates the spatial data extraction processes as the signals of moving vehicles should be identified and removed. Rather than removing and discarding the signals, however, they can be turned into traffic flow information. This paper reviews initial research efforts to extract traffic flow information from laserscanner and digital camera sensors installed in airborne platforms.

This information does not give the whole picture of the two-dimensional traffic situation. In order to obtain precise knowledge about the traffic flow of a large area, only airborne cameras or cameras positioned at very high locations (towers, etc.) can provide an up-to-date image of all roads covered. The paper aims at showing the potential of using image time series from these cameras to derive traffic parameters on the basis of single car measurements. To be able to determine precise velocities and other parameters from an image time series, exact geocoding is one of the first requirements for the acquired image data. The methods presented here for determining several traffic parameters for single vehicles and vehicle groups involve recording and evaluating a number of digital or analog aerial images from high altitude and with a large total field of view. Visual and automatic methods for the interpretation of images are compared. It turns out that the recording frequency of the individual images should be at least 1/3 Hz (visual interpretation), but is preferably 3 Hz or more, especially for automatic vehicle tracking. The accuracy and potentials of the methods are analyzed and presented, as well as the usage of a digital road database for improving the tracking algorithm and for integrating the results for further traffic applications. Shortcomings of the methods are given as well as possible improvements regarding methodology and sensor platform. (C) 2006 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

J	Niu, XT				Niu, Xutong			A semi-automatic framework for highway extraction and vehicle detection based on a geometric deformable model	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						semi-automation; road extraction; vehicle detection; aerial photography	AUTOMATIC ROAD EXTRACTION	Road extraction and vehicle detection are two of the most important steps of traffic flow analysis from multi-frame aerial photographs. The traditional way of deriving traffic flow trajectories relies on manual vehicle counting from a sequence of aerial photographs. It is tedious and time-consuming work. To improve this process, this research presents a new semi-automatic framework for highway extraction and vehicle detection from aerial photographs. The basis of the new framework is a geometric deformable model. This model refers to the minimization of an objective function that connects the optimization problem with the propagation of regular curves. Utilizing implicit representation of two-dimensional curve, the implementation of this model is capable of dealing with topological changes during curve deformation process and the output is independent of the position of the initial curves. A seed point propagation framework is designed and implemented. This framework incorporates highway extraction, tracking, and linking into one procedure. Manually selected seed points can be automatically propagated throughout a whole highway network. During the process, road center points are also extracted, which introduces a search direction for solving possible blocking problems. This new framework has been successfully applied to highway network extraction and vehicle detection from a large orthophoto mosaic. In this research, vehicles on the extracted highway network were detected with an 83% success rate. (C) 2006 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).

Ground target tracking and road map extraction	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						tracking; road extraction; Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI); retrodiction; MHT (Multi-Hypotheses Tracking); sequential track extraction		For analyzing dynamic scenarios with many ground moving vehicles, airborne Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) radar is well-suited due to its wide-area, all-weather, day/night, and real time capabilities. The generation of GMTI tracks from these data is the backbone for ground surveillance and traffic flow analysis. In case of dense target situations, missing detections and false alarms, Multi-Hypotheses Tracking (MHT) is the method at choice to solve the inherent ambiguities in the data-targets assignment problem. The resulting MHT-tracks are suited to extract road map information which is highly up-to-date and fairly precise. Moreover, their accuracy is quantitatively described. The precision of the extracted road segments can be improved significantly using smoothed or retrodicted tracks. In turn, the extracted road information is exploited for the precise tracking of succeeding road targets. The proposed, fully Bayesian approach is illustrated by a simulated example including Doppler and terrain obscuration, providing hints to the achievable road map accuracies.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of State Department of Transportation Investment Decisions: Linking Performance Measures to Resource Allocation	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article						Information management; Statistics; Traffic flow; Transportation networks; Urban planning; Surveys		In recent years, many state departments of transportation (DOTs) have developed performance measures to monitor their transportation systems and improve transportation planning. One of the main outstanding questions with regard to using performance measures is how to best characterize the connection between resources and outcomes, particularly at a system (state) level. In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of state DOT investment decisions on two performance areas: Safety and congestion. We collected expenditure and performance data from 1984-2000 and developed state-specific linear regression models for each performance area. The statistical significance and direction of influence of each expenditure category varied between models, so we used 29 transportation-system characteristics to interpret model results. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of the link between resources and outcome and will help state DOTs utilize their new funding opportunities, improve their planning procedures and address government accountability concerns.

On the variational theory of traffic flow: Well-posedness, duality and applications	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of Networks and Heterogeneous Media	JUN 21-23, 2006	Maiori, ITALY	Amer Inst Math Sci, Ist Applicazioni Calcolo Rome, Univ Salerno, DIIMA		traffic flow theory; Hamilton-Jacobi equations; variational principles; duality	KINEMATIC WAVES; MODEL	This paper describes some simplifications allowed by the variational theory of traffic flow(VT). It presents general conditions guaranteeing that the solution of a VT problem with bottlenecks exists, is unique and makes physical sense; i.e., that the problem is well-posed. The requirements for well-posedness are mild and met by practical applications. They are consistent with narrower results available for kinematic wave or Hamilton-Jacobi theories. The paper also describes some duality ideas relevant to these theories. Duality and VT are used to establish the equivalence of eight traffic models. Finally, the paper discusses how its ideas can be used to model networks of multi-lane traffic streams.

After some comments on linear flow the emphasis turns to collective traffic flow, as it is captured by driven lattice-based excluding-particle models. An approximate treatment is then given of the most fundamental of these (the onedimensional "ASEP"), covering its "jamming" steady-state phase transition and its kink dynamics, in both discrete and continuum versions. Necessary generalisations of the process, and of the geometry (to multi-lanes and to higher dimensions), as well as multi-species generalisations, are then briefly discussed, followed by an introduction to exact analytic approaches and recent developments.

We discuss the basic principles which have lead to the development of realistic CA models for the description of highway traffic. Sophisticated models reproduce even the microscopic structure of traffic flow and have shed some light on the relation between the observed traffic phases and the behaviour of the drivers. Due to the simplicity of the models even large networks can be simulated faster than real time and so traffic forecasting has become possible. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ericsson, E; Larsson, H; Brundell-Freij, K				Ericsson, Eva; Larsson, Hanna; Brundell-Freij, Karin			Optimizing route choice for lowest fuel consumption - Potential effects of a new driver support tool	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						fuel consumption; probe vehicle; driving pattern; navigation system; street types; traffic flow; street classification; traffic disturbance		Today, driver support tools intended to increase traffic safety, provide the driver with convenient information and guidance, or save time are becoming more common. However, few systems have the primary aim of reducing the environmental effects of driving. The aim of this project was to estimate the potential for reducing fuel consumption and thus the emission of CO, through a navigation system where optimization of route choice is based on the lowest total fuel consumption (instead of the traditional shortest time or distance), further the supplementary effect if such navigation support could take into account real-time information about traffic disturbance events from probe vehicles running in the street network. The analysis was based on a large database of real traffic driving patterns connected to the street network in the city of Lund, Sweden. Based on 15437 cases, the fuel consumption factor for 22 street classes, at peak and off-peak hours, was estimated for three types of cars using two mechanistic emission models. Each segment in the street network was, on a digitized map, attributed an average fuel consumption for peak and off-peak hours based on its street class and traffic flow conditions. To evaluate the potential of a fuel-saving navigation system the routes of 109 real journeys longer than 5 min were extracted from the database. Using Esri's external program ArcGIS, Arcview and the external module Network Analysis, the most fuel-economic route was extracted and compared with the original route, as well as routes extracted from criterions concerning shortest time and shortest distance. The potential for further benefit when the system employed real-time data concerning the traffic situation through 120 virtual probe vehicles running in the street network was also examined. It was found that for 46% of trips in Lund the drivers spontaneous choice of route was not the most fuel-efficient. These trips could save, on average, 8.2% fuel by using a fuel-optimized navigation system. This corresponds to a 4% fuel reduction for all journeys in Lund. Concerning the potential for real-time information from probe vehicles, it was found that the frequency of disturbed segments in Lund was very low, and thus so was the potential fuel-saving. However, a methodology is presented that structures the steps required in analyzing such a system. It is concluded that real-time traffic information has the potential for fuel-saving in more congested areas if a sufficiently large proportion of the disturbance events can be identified and reported in real-time.

Density viscous continuum traffic flow model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; continuum hydrodynamic model; viscous	KINEMATIC WAVES; JAMS	A new traffic flow model called density viscous continuum model is developed to describe traffic more reasonably. The two delay time scales are taken into consideration, differing from the model proposed by Xue and Dai [Phys. Rev. E 68 (2003) 066123]. Moreover the relative density is added to the motion equation from which the viscous term can be derived, so we obtain the macroscopic continuum model from microscopic car following model successfully. The condition for stable traffic flow is derived. Nonlinear analysis shows that the density fluctuation in traffic flow induces density waves. Near the onset of instability, a small disturbance could lead to solitons determined by the Korteweg-de-Vries (KdV) equation, and the soliton solution is derived. The results show that local cluster effects can be obtained from the new model and are consistent with the diverse nonlinear dynamical phenomena observed in the freeway traffic.

Phase transition of traffic states with on-ramp	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						phase transition; synchronized traffic flow; anisotropic continuum model; on-ramp	KINETIC DERIVATION; FLOW; MODEL; WAVES; SIMULATION; CLUSTERS; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAY; JAMS	We study the phase transition on a highway in a modified anisotropic continuum model with an on-ramp, which is recently developed by Gupta and Katiyar (J. Phys. A: Math. Nucl. Gen. 38 (2005) 4069]. To investigate whether this model can describe several distinct traffic states that are identified from real-traffic data [Kerner and Rehborn, Phys. Rev. Lett. 79 (1997) 4030; Kerner, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81 (1998) 3797], we carry out numerical simulations with an open boundary condition. The observed transition between free flow and various types of congested flow such as localized clusters, stop-and-go traffic and different kinds of synchronized traffic flow is obtained by applying a triggering pulse through an on-ramp in our simulation. We present the phase diagram for three representative values of the upstream boundary flux and for the whole range of the on-ramp flux. Several states like pinned localized cluster, triggered stop-and-go, recurring hump state, the oscillatory congested traffic and the homogeneous congested traffic are observed in phase transition from free flow to traffic-jam state. The phase diagram for our model near on-ramp is consistent with the results obtained by Lee et al. [Phys. Rev. E 59(5) (1999) 5101]. The results suggest that the modified model is able to describe all the three phases of traffic-flow theory developed by Kerner [Physica A 333 (2004) 379]. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

The influence of urban land-use on non-motorised transport casualties	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						accidents; crashes; pedestrian; cyclist; casualties; urban land-use; spatial analysis	SPATIAL-ANALYSIS; DESIGN; RATES	The relationship between non-motorised road traffic casualties and land-use was investigated in two zones of approximately 8 km(2) in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. Road traffic accidents are, more usually, analysed in relation to traffic flow, on the assumption that the latter can be derived from land-use data. Here, a direct relationship between primary functional land-use and non-motorised casualties is estimated. We review past work in this area. A shortcoming of casualty data is that it does not record the origin and destination of the journeys being undertaken when the accident occurred. A method was established to identify zones within which most accidents could reasonably be expected to be related to the land-uses within that zone. Generalised linear models were developed using non-motorised casualties as the response variable, with primary functional land-use, population density and junction density as explanatory variables. Separate models were constructed for each combination of cyclists and pedestrians, adults and children, working and non-working hours in city centre and suburban analysis zones. In general, the study found that pedestrian casualties in the city centre zone are particularly associated with an increase in retail and community land-use during working hours. In the city centre zone, out of working hours, an increase in retail land-use (almost certainly clubs and bars) is also associated with an increase in pedestrian casualties. An increase in cyclist casualties during working hours (in the non-pedestrianised area) is associated with an increase in retail land-use. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Forssen, J; Hornikx, M				Forssen, Jens; Hornikx, Maarten			Statistics of A-weighted road traffic noise levels in shielded urban areas	ACTA ACUSTICA UNITED WITH ACUSTICA			English	Article							ACOUSTICAL PERFORMANCE; SOUND-PROPAGATION; MODEL; SOUNDSCAPES; FLOW	In the context of community noise and its negative effects, the noise descriptors used are usually long-term equivalent levels and, sometimes, maximum levels. An improved description could be achieved by including the time variations of the noise. Here, the time variations of A-weighted road traffic noise levels have been studied. Of special interest are situations with a shielded courtyard. For numerical results, a ray model has been used for calculating the sound propagation, and the traffic has been modelled as a Poisson process. With this model the statistics of A-weighted levels have been investigated for different situations with varying traffic flows. Results from an in-situ measurement have been compared with those from the numerical model, showing acceptable agreement. It is shown both by numerical modelling and measurements that the time variations in noise level are smaller in a courtyard than in a corresponding directly exposed situation. One of the additional conclusions is that the noise reduction of the maximum level can be significantly higher than that of the equivalent level.

Congestion appears as stop-and-go waves and high-density uniform flow. We perform simulations of traffic flow with a bottleneck using the coupled map optimal velocity model. The bottleneck is expressed as a road segment with speed reduction. The speed reduction in the bottleneck controls the emergence of stop-and-go waves.

We focus in particular on source terms for modeling highway entries and exits or local changes of the traffic flow due to inhomogeneities of the road. Rigorous well-posedness results and numerical investigations are presented. We show in particular how real phenomena (e.g. the formation of a queue) that are not captured by models based on systems of conservation laws are instead observable with our models.

In the case of discrete densities, we assume equal number of vehicles in each lane. Except for the minimum density, the gridlock emerges swiftly. Two kinds of gridlock have been observed. The global gridlock dominates the system when the density is twice the minimum value. At higher densities, the system is pervaded by local gridlocks. We also analyze the time evolution of average speed. In the case of continuous densities, the vehicle numbers vary from lane to lane. The global gridlock is then destroyed by the fluctuations; while the local gridlock can still be observed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis of stability and density waves of traffic flow model in an ITS environment	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS	By introducing relative velocities of arbitrary number of cars ahead into the full velocity difference models (FVDM), we present a forward looking relative velocity model (FLRVM) of cooperative driving control system. To our knowledge, the model is an improvement over the similar extension in the forward looking optimal velocity models (FLOVM), because it is more reasonable and realistic in implement of incorporating intelligent transportation system in traffic. Then the stability criterion is investigated by the linear stability analysis with finding that new consideration theoretically lead to the improvement of the stability of traffic flow, and the validity of our theoretical analysis is confirmed by direct simulations. In addition, nonlinear analysis of the model shows that the three waves: triangular shock wave, soliton wave and kink-antikink wave appear respectively in stable, metastable and unstable regions. These correspond to the solutions of the Burgers equation, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation.

J	Burris, MW				Burris, Mark W.			Incorporating variable toll rates in transportation planning models	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT ECONOMICS			English	Article							DEPARTURE-TIME; CHOICE; ROUTE	As transportation planning agencies look for cost-effective means to alleviate traffic congestion, one method is rarely investigated - variable tolls. Tolls that vary by time of day can be an effective demand management tool. One reason variable tolls are seldom used in practice is that planners cannot simply incorporate the variable toll rates into the models used to develop transportation alternatives. This research examined some of the factors involved in adding variable tolls to a transportation planning model and constructed a basic version of the variable tolling portion of that model. This basic model was then used to examine how a simple peak and off-peak variable toll rate might impact traffic flow. Not surprisingly the variable toll reduced the peaking of traffic and reduced the total congestion and delay experienced by travelers. Improving transportation planning models in this manner would allow planners to compare these model results to results of other traffic congestion reduction options and select the right mix of strategies for their area.

J	Murat, YS				Murat, Y. Sazi			Comparison of fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks approaches in vehicle delay modeling	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						fuzzy logic; artificial neural networks; delay, model; traffic flows; junctions; signalization	SYSTEM	Modeling vehicle delay has been an interesting subject for traffic engineers and urban planners. Determination of vehicle delay is a complex task and the delay is influenced by many variables that have uncertainties and vagueness, especially for non-uniform or over-saturated conditions. In this study, vehicle delay is modeled using new approaches such as Fuzzy Logic (FL) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to deal with all conditions. The Neuro Fuzzy Delay Estimation (NFDE) model and Artificial Neural Networks Delay Estimation (ANNDE) model are developed. The overall delay data required for the model were collected from ten signalized intersections in Turkey. The results of the developed models are compared with the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), Akqelik's methods and the delay data collected from intersections. The results showed that delay estimations by the ANNDE and NFDE model are promising. It is also inferred that the NFDE model results are the best fitted. The Average Relative Error (ARE) rates of NFDE model are determined as 7% for under-saturated and 5% for over-saturated conditions. The results reflect the fact that the neuro-fuzzy approach may be used as a promising method in vehicle delay estimation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Linear stability analysis shows that the uniform flow equilibrium of the system loses its stability via Hopf bifurcations and thus oscillations can appear. The stability and amplitudes of the oscillations are determined with the help of normal-form calculations of the Hopf bifurcation that also handles the essential translational symmetry of the system. We show that the subcritical case of the Hopf bifurcation occurs robustly, which indicates the possibility of bistability. We also show how these oscillations lead to spatial wave formation as can be observed in real-world traffic flows.

J	Chang, GL; Zhu, ZJ				Chang, Gang-len; Zhu, Zuojin			A macroscopic traffic model for highway work zones: Formulations and numerical results	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article							FLOW; DYNAMICS; WAVES	This study presents a multilane model for analyzing the dynamic traffic properties of a highway segment under a lane-closure operation that often incurs complex interactions between mandatory lane-changing vehicles and traffic at unblocked lanes. The proposed traffic flow formulations employ the hyperbolic model used in the non-Newtonian fluid dynamics, and assume the lane-changing intensity between neighboring lanes as a function of their difference in density. The results of extensive simulation experiments indicate that the proposed model is capable of realistically replicating the impacts of lane-changing maneuvers from the blocked lanes on the overall traffic conditions, including the interrelations between the approaching flow density, the resulting congestion level, and the exiting flow rate from the lane-closure zone. Our extensive experimental analyses also confirm that traffic conditions will deteriorate dramatically and evolve to the state of traffic jam if the density has exceeded its critical level that varies with the type of lane-closure operations. This study also provides a convenient way for computing such a critical density under various lane-closure conditions, and offers a theoretical basis for understanding the formation as well as dissipation of traffic jam.

J	Kurant, M; Thiran, P				Kurant, Maciej; Thiran, Patrick			Extraction and analysis of traffic and topologies of transportation networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CENTRALITY	The knowledge of real-life traffic patterns is crucial for a good understanding and analysis of transportation systems. These data are quite rare. In this paper we propose an algorithm for extracting both the real physical topology and the network of traffic flows from timetables of public mass transportation systems. We apply this algorithm to timetables of three large transportation networks. This enables us to make a systematic comparison between three different approaches to construct a graph representation of a transportation network; the resulting graphs are fundamentally different. We also find that the real-life traffic pattern is very heterogenous, in both space and traffic flow intensities, which makes it very difficult to approximate the node load with a number of topological estimators.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, L. C.			Controlling traffic flow near the transition to the synchronous flow phase	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic model; traffic flown; traffic metering; congested flow	SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; RAMP CONTROL; MODEL; STATES	For constant incoming flow far upstream of a freeway on-ramp, the flow downstream (throughput) and the rate of merging are studied with simulations using a generalized optimal velocity model. For large enough merge rates, a transition to synchronous flow occurs and the throughput is reduced by 0.5-0.7 vehicle on average for each vehicle that merges. For smaller merge rates there is free flow on the freeway and the throughput is the sum of the merge rate and the flow upstream of the on-ramp. Thus, there is an optimum merge rate that maximizes the throughput for a given incoming flow rate. These results hold for a wide range of initial vehicle position and velocity profiles and for single- as well as double-lane freeways. The results show that the transition to synchronous flow is due to the dynamics of the merge process, rather than to a limitation on the capacity of the downstream portion of the freeway. As a consequence, a new on-ramp metering algorithm, which controls the merge rate to prevent the transition to synchronous flow and concomitantly to maximize flow, has been developed.

J	Jiang, R; Helbing, D; Shukla, PK; Wu, QS				Jiang, Rui; Helbing, Dirk; Shukla, Pradyumn Kumar; Wu, Qing-Song			Inefficient emergent oscillations in intersecting driven many-particle flows	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; pedestrian flow; oscillations	TRAFFIC STATES; DYNAMICS; ORGANIZATION; SIMULATION; FEATURES; PHYSICS	Oscillatory flow patterns have been observed in many different driven many-particle systems. It seems reasonable to assume that the emergent oscillations in opposing flows are due to or related to an increased efficiency (throughput). In this contribution, however, we will study intersecting pedestrian and vehicle flows as an example for inefficient emergent oscillations. In the coupled vehicle pedestrian delay problem, oscillating pedestrian and vehicle flows form when pedestrians cross the street with a small time gap to approaching cars, while both pedestrians and vehicles benefit, when they keep some overcritical time gap. That is, when the safety time gap of pedestrians is increased, the average delay time of pedestrians decreases and the vehicle flow goes Lip. This may be interpreted as a slower-is-faster effect. The underlying mechanism of this effect is explained. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Akbas, A; Ergun, M				Akbas, Ahmet; Ergun, Murat			Freeway traffic flow control by lumped parameter system approach	INDIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND MATERIALS SCIENCES			English	Article							WAVES	Freeway traffic flows can be controlled by lumped parameter system approach owing to the space discretized system models. Such a control model incorporating a coordinated ramp metering mechanism is proposed in this study. The non-linear state equations representing the traffic system dynamics are derived from the conservation law in difference equations form. The control model is obtained by a feedback linearization approach, so that the target density of the controller is chosen as the critical density of the traffic system. Simulation based test studies have been done in a VISSIM simulation environment in order to compare the data obtained by the shock wave modified feedback linearization method to the non-modified type, with respect to the uncontrolled system performance. Test results show that the main-link flow performance is increased sufficiently by the proposed control model.

The model is obtained by coupling together the classical Lighthill-Whitham-Richards equation with the 2 x 2 system proposed by Aw and Rascle. This allows us both to correct some drawbacks of the original 2 x 2 system, and to obtain results that fit experimental data well. We describe the solutions of the Riemann problem, and we compare the results with those obtained using other models. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Essence of conservation forms in the traveling wave solutions of higher-order traffic flow models	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							PARAMETERS; STABILITY; CLUSTERS; HIGHWAY	This paper shows the essence of conservation forms when applying the weak solution theory to solve the traveling wave solution of a wide cluster in the Payne-Whitham (PW) model. The consideration of the conservation form for the acceleration equation is an important ingredient in the development of higher-order traffic flow models, but it is largely ignored in the research community. To fix the idea, we define two conservation forms for the same PW model, and consequently derive two solutions with different sets of characteristic parameters of the wide cluster. The analytical results are in good agreement with those that are obtained from numerical simulations. Moreover, these two solutions are also shown to be asymptotic to those of the well-known Kuhne and Kerner-Konhauser models with a viscosity term. More importantly, the careful treatment of the conservation form for the acceleration equation closes the important gap in the literature. Without the conservation form, the solution obtained depends very much on the design of numerical schemes, and can be quite arbitrary and may not adequately conform to the physically relevant properties.

J	Vu, P; Shankar, VN; Ulfarsson, GF				Vu, Patrick; Shankar, Venky N.; Ulfarsson, Gudmundur F.			Is access management good for business? Business perceptions of the effects of traffic access management on accessibility and patronage	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						access management; economic impacts; transportation planning; business perceptions; simultaneous logit model		Access management is widely defined as the planning, design and implementation of land-use and transportation strategies that control the flow of traffic between roads and surrounding land. Previous studies focus mainly on the positive benefits of access management on safety and traffic flow. To ensure optimal transportation design, the design process must be based on a sound understanding of the issues perceived to be important by businesses, residences and other users. This study explores how businesses perceive the economic impacts of access management, along with safety and congestion impacts. About 280 businesses along six major commercial corridors in Western Washington State were surveyed. The analytical framework was developed using the simultaneous logit model, which allows the simultaneous modeling of perceptions of different performance metrics, through an endogenous relationship. The findings show that significant factors affecting business perceptions include business type and operational variables, corridor and street environment variables, as well as willingness-to-pay ( WTP) measures.

J	Sheu, JB				Sheu, Jiuh-Biing			A composite traffic flow modeling approach for incident-responsive network traffic assignment	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic simulation; route choice; incident-induced traffic congestion; incident-responsive; Lighthill-Whitham model; traffic assignment	REAL-TIME PREDICTION; ROUTE	This paper presents a hybrid traffic simulation-based model to address the network traffic route choice issue under conditions of lane-blocking incidents on surface streets. The proposed approach includes four sequential mechanisms: (1) link flow loading, (2) link traffic moving, (3) link cost calculation, and (4) searching the shortest path. To deal with the traffic flows moving on lane-blocking links, specific incident-induced link traffic flow models, which are extended from the Lighthill-Whitham (L-W for short) model, are formulated. A simulation-based approach is then proposed to determine the instantaneous shortest path associated with each vehicle approaching to each given intersection on the network. In addition, numerical examples associated with diverse incident scenarios are investigated. The numerical results demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed simulation-based method by reducing the network-wide path travel time by 11.4% and the incident impact on link traffic flows by 66.7% in comparison with the Paramics traffic simulator. It is expected that this study can provide linkage between the fields of incident management and dynamic traffic assignment that will allow the development of such related technologies as real-time incident-responsive route guidance and incident management systems.

J	Li, XG; Jia, B; Gao, ZY; Jiang, R				Li, Xin-Gang; Jia, Bin; Gao, Zi-You; Jiang, Rui			A realistic two-lane cellular automata traffic model considering aggressive lane-changing behavior of fast vehicle	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						aggressive lane-changing; cellular automata; mixed traffic; traffic flow	FLOW; STATES; RULES	In real traffic, a vehicle may perform different lane-changing behavior if its preceding vehicle is different. Fast vehicle usually has aggressive lane-changing behavior when its preceding vehicle is a slow one. In this paper, we take the factor into account and propose a new symmetric two-lane cellular automata model. It is shown that aggressive lane-changing behavior of fast vehicle can depress the plug formed by slow vehicles and improve traffic flow in mixed traffic in the intermediate density range. The simulation results also indicate that ping-pang lane-changing behavior is mainly caused by fast vehicles that are hindered by fast vehicles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

After the simulation with computer, the fundamental properties of this model have been revealed. Analysing this kind of road structure, this paper transforms the grade roundabout crossing with inner-roundabout-lane and outer-roundabout-lane into a configuration with many bottlenecks. Because of the self-organization, the traffic flow remains unblocked under a certain vehicle density. Some results of the simulation are close to the actual design parameter.

J	Sun, DZ; Benekohal, RF; Waller, ST				Sun, DZ; Benekohal, RF; Waller, ST			Bi-level programming formulation and heuristic solution approach for dynamic traffic signal optimization	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CONTROL POLICY; ALGORITHMS; CONSISTENT; EXISTENCE; CAPACITY	Although dynamic traffic control and traffic assignment are intimately connected in the framework of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), they have been developed independent of one another by most existing research. Conventional methods of signal timing optimization assume given traffic flow pattern, whereas traffic assignment is performed with the assumption of fixed signal timing. This study develops a bi-level programming formulation and heuristic solution approach (HSA) for dynamic traffic signal optimization in networks with time-dependent demand and stochastic route choice. In the bi-level programming model, the upper level problem represents the decision-making behavior (signal control) of the system manager, while the user travel behavior is represented at the lower level. The HSA consists of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Cell Transmission Simulation (CTS) based Incremental Logit Assignment (ILA) procedure. GA is used to seek the upper level signal control variables. ILA is developed to find user optimal flow pattern at the lower level, and CTS is implemented to propagate traffic and collect real-time traffic information. The performance of the HSA is investigated in numerical applications in a sample network. These applications compare the efficiency and quality of the global optima achieved by Elitist GA and Micro GA. Furthermore, the impact of different frequencies of updating information and different population sizes of GA on system performance is analyzed.

A linear programming formulation is introduced based on a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model that propagates traffic according to the cell transmission model. The introduced approach is limited to continuous link improvements and does not provide for new link additions. The main contribution of the article is to provide an analytical formulation for network design that accounts for DTA conditions that can be used for further analysis and extensions. The model is tested on a single destination example network, resembling a freeway corridor, for various congestion levels, loading patterns and budget sizes, to demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness of the approach.

Lateral distribution of mixed traffic on two-lane roads	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								Location of the outer wheel path is an important input in the measurement of deflection response of a pavement and its riding quality. In the simulation of mixed traffic flow, it is also required to assign the position of a vehicle within a lane when it enters the test section. The statistical distributions fitted through the placement data recorded on 19 different sections of two-lane highways in India indicate that the placement of vehicles may follow a unimodal or a bimodal Curve depending upon the percentage of slow and fast moving vehicles. Two parameters are introduced in this technical note. These are placement factor (PF) and skewness range (SR). It is observed that the placement data follow a unimodal curve if PF and SR are less than 1.3 and 0.54, respectively. Otherwise it is a case of bimodality.

J	Chen, XW; Meaker, JW; Zhan, FB				Chen, XW; Meaker, JW; Zhan, FB			Agent-based modeling and analysis of hurricane evacuation procedures for the Florida Keys	NATURAL HAZARDS			English	Article						hurricane; evacuation; agent-based microsimulation; Florida Keys	EMERGENCY EVACUATION; SIMULATION	The unique geography of the Florida Keys presents both high risk of hurricane landfall and exceptional vulnerability to the effects of a hurricane strike. Inadequate hurricane shelters in the Keys make evacuation the only option for most residents, but the sole access road can become impassable well in advance of a major storm. These extraordinary conditions create challenges for emergency managers who must ensure that appropriate emergency plans are in place and to ensure that an orderly exodus can occur without stranding large numbers of people along an evacuation route with inadequate shelter capacity. This study attempts to answer two questions: (1) What is the minimum clearance time needed to evacuate all residents participating in an evacuation of the Florida Keys in advance of a major hurricane for 92,596 people - a population size calculated based on the 2000 US Census population data, census undercounts, and the number of tourists estimated to be in the area? (2) If a hurricane makes landfall in the Keys while the evacuation is in progress, how many residents will need to be accommodated if the evacuation route becomes impassable? The authors conducted agent-based microsimulations to answer the questions. Simulation results suggest that it takes 20 h and 11 min to 20 h and 14 min to evacuate the 92,596 people. This clearance time is less than the Florida state mandated 24-h clearance time limit. If one assumes that people evacuate in a 48-h period and the traffic flow from the Keys would follow that observed in the evacuation from Hurricane Georges, then a total of 460 people may be stranded if the evacuation route becomes impassable 48 h after an evacuation order is issued. If the evacuation route becomes impassable 40 h after an evacuation order is issued, then 14,000 people may be stranded.

J	Jiang, R; Wu, QS				Jiang, Rui; Wu, Qing-Song			Phase transition at an on-ramp in the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic flow model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; phase transition; on-ramp	STATES; BOUNDARY; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS	Recent empirical observations show that traffic flow is related to various phase transitions, especially at bottlenecks. This paper studies traffic flow induced by an on-ramp in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model. It is shown that when considering the situation that vehicles on main road and on-ramp interact in a relatively long road section, first-order phase transition from free flow to congested flow occurs. In contrast, it is second-order phase transition from free flow to congested flow if the interaction road section is short. We have investigated the reason why first-order phase transition occurs. The interaction of vehicles may be viewed as a kind of cooperation behavior of drivers. Therefore, our results indicate that in future traffic flow research, investigation on cooperation behavior should be carried out. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Treiber, M; Kesting, A; Helbing, D				Treiber, Martin; Kesting, Arne; Helbing, Dirk			Understanding widely scattered traffic flows, the capacity drop, and platoons as effects of variance-driven time gaps	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; SIMULATION; SYSTEMS; STATES	We investigate the adaptation of the time headways in car-following models as a function of the local velocity variance, which is a measure of the inhomogeneity of traffic flow. We apply this mechanism to several car-following models and simulate traffic breakdowns in open systems with an on-ramp as bottleneck and in a closed ring road. Single-vehicle data and one-minute aggregated data generated by several virtual detectors show a semiquantitative agreement with microscopic and flow-density data from the Dutch freeway A9. This includes the observed distributions of the net time headways for free and congested traffic, the velocity variance as a function of density, and the fundamental diagram. The modal value of the time headway distribution is shifted by a factor of about 2 under congested conditions. Macroscopically, this corresponds to the capacity drop at the transition from free to congested traffic. The simulated fundamental diagram shows free, synchronized, and jammed traffic, and a wide scattering in the congested traffic regime. We explain this by a self-organized variance-driven process that leads to the spontaneous formation and decay of long-lived platoons even for a deterministic dynamics on a single lane.

In case of highway bridges, operating vehicle could be utilized to reduce the number of measuring devices. First this paper presents a static damage detection algorithm of using operating vehicle load. The technique has been validated by finite element simulation and simple laboratory test. Next the paper presents an approach of using this technique to field application. Here operating vehicle load data has been used by instrumenting the bridge at single location. This approach gives an upper hand to other sophisticated global damage detection methods since it has the potential of reducing the measuring points and devices. It also avoids the application of artificial loading and interruption of any traffic flow.

By performing numerical simulations under the periodic boundary condition, we find that the deceleration strips could be considered as the head-stream of traffic jams and they are apt to cause the small scale traffic jam. The maximum flow is decreased evidently when there are some deceleration strips on the road. But the increase of the number of deceleration strips only influences the maximum flow slightly. Furthermore, if the vehicle density is high enough, the influence of deceleration strips could be ignored. Therefore, the disadvantage of the deceleration strips may be ignored in city traffic because of the high density.

An extended car-following model based on intelligent transportation system application	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; intelligent transportation system; density waves	JAMMING TRANSITION; TRAFFIC FLOW	The jams in the congested traffic reveal various density waves. Some of them are described by the nonlinear wave equations: the Korteweg-de-Vries (KdV) equation, the Burgers equation and the modified KdV equation. An extended car following model are proposed in previous work, and the kink-antikink solution has been obtained from the mKdV equation. We continue to derive the KdV equation near the neutral stability line by applying the reductive perturbation method. The traffic jam could be thus described by the soliton solution, and the analysis result is consistent with the previous one. From the numerical simulations results, the soliton waves are found, and traffic jam is suppressed efficiently as encounter big disturbances. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kokowski, P; Makarewicz, R				Kokowski, P; Makarewicz, R			Predicted effects of a speed bump on light vehicle noise	APPLIED ACOUSTICS			English	Article						road traffic noise; interrupted traffic flow; speed bump		A speed bump reduces traffic noise levels during the deceleration phase and increases them during the acceleration phase. The net effect of a speed bump on noise from a light vehicle is assessed by means of the concept of noise energy density, S. This is a function of the instantaneous distance between the vehicle and the bump, S(x). To determine the function S(x) explicitly, five measurements of the sound exposure level, for each vehicle, are needed. It is assumed that the noise from each vehicle is generated by a single non-directional point source and propagates without vertical-surface reflections. An example prediction is presented based on measurements of sound exposure levels due to passenger cars. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A probabilistic dynamic programming formulation for a stochastic extension of the model is also presented. Analysis of the special structure of the dynamic programming formulation provides new insights into important aspects of certain traffic planning problems and represents a useful addition to the traffic network planner's toolkit.

Traffic engineers have resorted to alternative methods such as neural networks, but despite some promising results, the difficulties in their design and implementation remain unresolved. In addition, the opaqueness of trained networks, prevents understanding the underlying models. Fuzzy neural networks, which combine the complementary capabilities of both neural networks and fuzzy logic, thus constitute a more promising technique for modeling traffic flow. This paper describes the application of a specific class of fuzzy neural network known as the pseudo outer-product fuzzy neural network using the truth-value-restriction method (POPFNN-TVR) for short-term traffic flow prediction. The obtained results highlight the capability of POPFNN-TVR in fuzzy knowledge extraction and generalization from input data as well its high degree of prediction capability as compared to traditional feedforward neural networks using backpropagation learning.

J	Abdel-Aty, MA; Pemmanaboina, R				Abdel-Aty, Mohamed A.; Pemmanaboina, Rajashekar			Calibrating a real-time traffic crash-prediction model using archived weather and ITS traffic data	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Advanced Traffic Management System (ATMS); crash prediction; intelligent transportation system (ITS) data; logistic regression (LR); matched case-control LR; rain index	ROAD ACCIDENT	Growing concern over traffic safety has led to research efforts directed towards predicting freeway crashes in Advanced Traffic Management and Information Systems (ATMIS) environment. This paper aims at developing a crash-likelihood prediction model using real-time traffic-flow variables (measured through series of underground sensors) and rain data (collected at weather stations) potentially associated with crash occurrence. Archived loop detector and rain data and historical crash data have been used to calibrate the model. This model can be implemented using an online loop and rain data to identify high crash potential in real-time. Principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression (LR) have been used to estimate a weather model that determines a rain index based on the rain readings at the weather station in the proximity of the freeway. A matched case-control logit model has also been used to model the crash potential based on traffic loop data and the rain index. The 5-min average occupancy and standard deviation of volume observed at the downstream station, and the 5-min coefficient of variation in speed at the station closest to the crash, all during 5-10 min prior to the crash occurrence along with the rain index have been found to affect the crash occurrence most significantly.

Optimization criteria for modelling intersections of vehicular traffic flow	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						traffic flow; intersections; coupling conditions; optimization		We consider coupling conditions for the "Aw-Rascle" (AR) traffic flow model at an arbitrary road intersection. In contrast with coupling conditions previously introduced in [10] and [7], all the moments of the AR system are conserved and the total flux at the junction is maximized. This nonlinear optimization problem is solved completely. We show how the two simple cases of merging and diverging junctions can be extended to more complex junctions, like roundabouts. Finally, we present some numerical results.

UMER: An analog computer for dynamics of swarms interacting via long-range forces	NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTS & METHODS IN PHYSICS RESEARCH SECTION A-ACCELERATORS SPECTROMETERS DETECTORS AND ASSOCIATED EQUIPMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on High Intensity Beam Dynamics	SEP 12-16, 2005	Senigallia, ITALY			beams; swarms; nonlinear dynamics	MARYLAND-ELECTRON-RING; UNIVERSITY; ENERGY; SIMULATIONS; BEAMS	Some of the most challenging and interesting problems in nature involve large numbers of objects or particles mutually interacting through long-range forces. Examples range from galaxies and plasmas to flocks of birds and traffic flow on a highway. Even in cases where the form of the interacting force is precisely known, such as the 1/r(2)-dependent Coulomb and gravitational forces, such problems present a formidable theoretical and modeling challenge for large numbers of interacting bodies. This paper reports on a newly constructed, scaled particle accelerator that will serve as an experimental testbed for the dynamics of swarms interacting through long-range forces. Primarily designed for intense beam dynamics studies for advanced accelerators, the University of Maryland Electron Ring (UMER) design is described in detail and an update on commissioning is provided. An example application to a system other than a charged particle beam is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Tollazzi, T; Lerher, T; Sraml, M				Tollazzi, Tomaz; Lerher, Tone; Sraml, Matjaz			An analysis of the influence of pedestrians' traffic flow on the capacity of a roundabout using the discrete simulation method	STROJNISKI VESTNIK-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			Slovene	Article						roundabouts; traffic flow; influence analysis; simulation models		Like with other non-traffic-lighted intersections, the capacity of roundabouts can be reduced by special traffic conditions. In such cases the pedestrian and/or cyclist traffic flow, crossing one or more roundabout arms, is the size that influences the roundabout filling or emptying. The purpose of this paper is to show how the use of discrete simulation methods contributes to the decision on implementing a roundabout, or to help decide if the roundabout is going to fulfil appropriately the condition of the expected flow of pedestrians and/or cyclists. A new approach is suggested for dimensioning roundabouts, with mathematical modelling of the traffic flows using the discrete simulation method, and considering the statistically evaluated entry data for vehicles' and pedestrians' traffic flows. The simulation results are useful when determining the capacity of foreseen and suggested roundabouts, which will function in different circumstances. The presented model derives from the expected time void in the vehicles' traffic flow, used by the pedestrians, assuming their right of way when joining the traffic. The simulation analysis was verified on a real example of a montage roundabout in Koroska Street in Maribor where measurements of the motorised vehicles' traffic flow, and pedestrians' and cyclists' traffic flow were made. The procedure, shown in the paper along with the scientific approach to mathematical modelling, presents a practical method, helpful when deciding whether to implement a roundabout in the case of heavy pedestrians' and/or cyclists' traffic flows.

RENAISSANCE is designed on the basis of stochastic macroscopic freeway network traffic flow modeling, extended Kalman filtering, and a number of traffic surveillance algorithms. Fed with a limited amount of real-time traffic measurements, RENAISSANCE enables a number of freeway network traffic surveillance tasks, including traffic state estimation and short-term traffic state prediction, travel time estimation and prediction, queue tail/head/length estimation and prediction, and incident alarm. The traffic state estimation and prediction lay the operating foundation of RENAISSANCE since RENAISSANCE bases the other traffic surveillance tasks on its traffic state estimation or prediction results. The paper first introduces the utilized stochastic macroscopic freeway network traffic flow model and a real-time traffic measurement model, upon which the complete dynamic system model of RENAISSANCE is established with special attention to the handling of some important model parameters. The algorithms for the various traffic surveillance tasks addressed are described along with the functional architecture of the tool. A simulation test was conducted via application of RENAISSANCE to a hypothetical freeway network example with a sparse detector configuration, and the testing results are presented in some detail. Final conclusions and future work are outlined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A real-time crash prediction model was developed to estimate crash potential based on short-term variation of traffic flow characteristics. A microscopic traffic simulation model was used to realistically simulate changes in traffic conditions as an effect of variable speed limits and combined with the crash prediction model for the evaluation of control logics. Within this integrated evaluation framework, the study investigated the effect of strategy control factors on the crash potential reduction and total travel time. The study results indicated that variable speed limits could reduce crash potential by 5-17%, by temporarily reducing speed limits during risky traffic conditions when crash potential exceeded the pre-specified threshold.

J	Jiang, R; Wu, QS				Jiang, R; Wu, QS			A stopped time dependent randomization cellular automata model for traffic flow controlled by traffic light	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton; traffic light	SINGLE VEHICLE; TRANSITION; SEQUENCE	Modelling road traffic behavior using cellular automata has become a well-established method to analyze, understand, and even forecast the behavior of real road traffic, because the automata's evolution rules are simple, computationally efficient. In this paper, we presented a new model. In this model, the randomization probability is defined to be function of the stopped time of the vehicle: the longer the vehicle stops, the larger the randomization probability is. This means that the sensitivity of the drivers depends on the stopped time. The simulations show that although the fundamental diagram of the new model is similar to that of Nagel-Schreckenberg model, the saturated current depends on the cycle time of traffic light. We have explained the dependence of saturated current on cycle time and made the outlook of the future work. Our results indicate that we can adjust the cycle time of the traffic lights to enhance the road capacity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Modelling traffic flow at multi-lane urban roundabouts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						traffic flow modelling; multi-lane roundabouts; cellular automata; Multistream Minimum Acceptable Space	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SIMULATION	This paper proposes Multi-stream Minimum Acceptable Space (MMAS) Cellular Automata (CA) models to study unsignalised multi-lane (two- or three-lane) urban roundabouts. Through detailed space considerations, using Cellular Automata (CA) and the Multi-stream Minimum Acceptable Space method, heterogeneity and inconsistency of driver behavior and interactions in cross traffic at entrances of roundabouts are simulated by incorporation of four different categories of driver behavior (i.e., conservative, moderate, urgent and radical), together with reassignment of categories with given probabilities at each time step. The method is able to reproduce many features of urban traffic, for which gap-acceptance models are not robust. Multi-lane roundabout models, in particular for two-lane roundabouts, are developed with different vehicle lane-allocation patterns. Various properties of multi-lane roundabout operations have been explored including throughput, turning rates, critical arrival rates and congestion. The operations of two- and three-lane roundabouts are compared in terms of throughputs. Vehicle movements in this paper relate to left-side driving, such as found in Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. However, results are generally applicable to the countries where the give-way rule is applied.

The most common causes of bridge collapse are scouring of the streambed and banks and erosion of highway embankments. This study couples a synthetic river flow simulation technique with a scour model for cohesive soils and determines the expected scour depth for a given lifetime of the bridge. A fractionally differenced autoregressive integrated moving average model generates synthetic streamflow sequences of the same length as the expected lifetime of the bridge. The scour model predicts the progression of scour depth through time in a multilayered soil. The model is used to determine the scour depth associated with different replicates of the synthetic flow sequences of the same length as the lifetime of the bridge. The probability distribution of scour depth is estimated by repeating this simulation procedure over a number of independent realizations of streamflow series for a given life of the bridge. This approach provides a framework for the probabilistic design and risk analysis of bridge foundations subjected to scour.

At the same time, the effect of sex and driving experience on speed estimation was analyzed. Thirty-six participants (18 male and 18 female, half of each group being drivers and half non-drivers) estimated the speed of the car in which they travelled as passengers. The actual speed values varied in the range of 40-100 km/h for the secondary road, 70-120 km/h for the highway condition, and 40-120 km/h for the track. The results obtained for the track in previous studies (Recarte & Nunes, 1996; Recarte, Conchillo, & Nunes, 2004, 2005) were replicated in the same condition and were also verified for the secondary road scenario. However, a different pattern of errors was found for the highway. From the viewpoint of psychophysics, the participants were more accurate on the without-traffic track than in real traffic conditions, considered as a whole. The differences found between road and highway are discussed. No effect was found for between-subject variables, sex, and driving experience.

J	Boel, R; Mihaylova, L				Boel, R; Mihaylova, L			A compositional stochastic model for real time freeway traffic simulation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						macroscopic traffic models; freeway traffic; stochastic systems; sending and receiving functions	FLOW	Traffic flow on freeways is a non-linear, many-particle phenomenon, with complex interactions between vehicles. This paper presents a stochastic model of freeway traffic at a time scale and of a level of detail suitable for on-line estimation, routing and ramp metering control. The freeway is considered as a network of interconnected components, corresponding to one-way road links consisting of consecutively connected short sections (cells). The compositional model proposed here extends the Daganzo cell transmission model by defining sending and receiving functions explicitly as random variables, and by also specifying the dynamics of the average speed in each cell. Simple stochastic equations describing the macroscopic traffic behavior of each cell, as well as its interaction with neighboring cells are obtained. This will allow the simulation of quite large road networks by composing many links. The model is validated over synthetic data with abrupt changes in the number of lanes and over real traffic data sets collected from a Belgian freeway. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kachani, S; Perakis, G				Kachani, S; Perakis, G			Fluid dynamics models and their applications in transportation and pricing	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						traffic; transportation; supply chain management; fluid models; travel time functions; dynamic user-equilibrium; dynamic pricing	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; TRAVEL-TIME FUNCTIONS; TRAFFIC FLOW; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; KINEMATIC WAVES; ASSIGNMENT	Fluid dynamics models provide a powerful deterministic technique to approximate stochasticity in a variety of application areas. In this paper, we study two classes of fluid models, investigate their relationship as well as some of their applications. This analysis allows us to provide analytical models of travel times as they arise in dynamically evolving environments, such as transportation networks as well as supply chains. In particular, using the laws of hydrodynamic theory, we first propose and examine a general second-order fluid model. We consider a first-order approximation of this model and show how it is helpful in analyzing the dynamic traffic equilibrium problem. Furthermore, we present an alternate class of fluid models that are traditionally used in the context of dynamic traffic assignment. By interpreting travel times as price/inventory-sojourn-time relationships, we are also able to connect this approach with a tractable fluid model in the context of dynamic pricing and inventory management.

J	Kong, XJ; Gao, ZY; Li, KP				Kong, XJ; Gao, ZY; Li, KP			A two-lane cellular automata model with influence of next-nearest neighbor vehicle	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						cellular automata; car-following model; double look-ahead model	TRAFFIC-FLOW MODEL; METASTABLE STATES; RULES; TRANSITION; SIMULATION; DYNAMICS; ROADWAY	In this paper, we propose a new two-lane cellular automata model in which the influence of the next-nearest neighbor vehicle is considered. The attributes of the traffic system composed of fast-lane and slow-lane are investigated by the new traffic model. The simulation results show that the proposed two-lane traffic model can reproduce some traffic phenomena observed in real traffic, and that maximum flux and critical density are close to the field measurements. Moreover, the initial density distribution of the fast-lane and slow-lane has much influence on the traffic flow states. With the ratio between the densities of slow lane and fast lane increasing the lane changing frequency increases, but maximum flux decreases. Finally, the influence of the sensitivity coefficients is discussed.

J	Zhu, YF; Kuhn, T; Mayo, P; Hinds, WC				Zhu, YF; Kuhn, T; Mayo, P; Hinds, WC			Comparison of daytime and nighttime concentration profiles and size distributions of ultrafine particles near a major highway	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							PARTICULATE EMISSION; NUMBER-DISTRIBUTION; AIR-POLLUTION; EVOLUTION; ROAD; SUBMICROMETER; MORTALITY; CITIES	Previously we have conducted systematic measurements of the concentration and size distribution of ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways during daytime in Los Angeles. The present study compares these with similar measurements made at night. Particle number concentration was measured by a condensation particle counter (CPC) and size distributions in the size range from 7 to 300 nm were measured by a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS). Measurements were taken at 30, 60, 90,150, and 300 m upwind and downwind from the center of the 1-405 freeway. Average traffic flow at night was about 25% of that observed during the day. Particle number concentration measured at 30 m downwind from the freeway was 80% of previous daytime measurements. This discrepancy between changes in traffic counts and particle number concentrations is apparently due to the decreased temperature, increased relative humidity, and lower wind speed at night. Particle size distributions do not change as dramatically as they did during the daytime. Particle number concentration decays exponentially downwind from the freeway similarly to what was observed during the day, but at a slower rate. No particle number concentration gradient has been observed for the upwind side of the freeway. No PM2.5 and very weak PM10 concentration gradients were observed downwind of the freeway at night. Ultrafine particle number concentration measured at 300 m downwind from the freeway was still distinguishably higher than upwind background concentration at night. These data may be used to help estimate exposure to ultrafine particles in the vicinity of major highways for epidemiology studies.

J	Lammer, S; Kori, H; Peters, K; Helbing, D				Lammer, S; Kori, H; Peters, K; Helbing, D			Decentralised control of material or traffic flows in networks using phase-synchronisation	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on Information and Material Flows in Complex Networks	JUN 15-JUL 15, 2005	ITALY			synchronisation; phase-oscillators; traffic light control; adaptive control	MODEL	We present a self-organising, decentralised control method for material flows in networks. The concept applies to networks where time sharing mechanisms between conflicting flows in nodes are required and where a coordination of these local switches on a system-wide level can improve the performance. We show that, under certain assumptions, the control of nodes can be mapped to a network of phase-oscillators. By synchronising these oscillators, the desired global coordination is achieved. We illustrate the method in the example of traffic signal control for road networks. The proposed concept is flexible, adaptive, robust and decentralised. It can be transferred to other queuing networks such as production systems. Our control approach makes use of simple synchronisation principles found in various biological systems in order to obtain collective behaviour from local interactions. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

As vehicle and information propagation occur on similar time scales, the network dynamics strongly influences message propagation, which is done by the movement of nodes (cars) and by hops between nearby nodes: two cars within the limited broadcast range establish a dynamic link. Using the cars of the other driving direction as relay stations, the weak connectivity within one driving direction when the density of equipped cars is small can be overcome. By analytical calculation and by microscopic simulation of freeway traffic with a given percentage of vehicles equipped for inter-vehicle communication, we investigate how the equipment level influences the efficiency and velocity of information propagation. By simulating the formation of a typical traffic jam, we show how the non-local information about bottlenecks and jam fronts can travel upstream and reach potential users. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

J	Kurant, M; Thiran, P				Kurant, M; Thiran, P			Layered complex networks	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								Many complex networks are only a part of larger systems, where a number of coexisting topologies interact and depend on each other. We introduce a layered model to facilitate the description and analysis of such systems. As an example of its application, we study the load distribution in three transportation systems, where the lower layer is the physical infrastructure and the upper layer represents the traffic flows. This layered view allows us to capture the fundamental differences between the real load and commonly used load estimators, which explains why these estimators fail to approximate the real load.

A new dynamics model is proposed, which contains the speed gradient-based momentum equations derived from a car-following theory suited to two-lane traffic flow. The conditions for securing the linear stability of the new model are presented. Numerical tests are carried out and some nonequilibrium phenomena are observed, such as small disturbance instability, stop-and-go waves, local clusters and phase transition.

J	Lei, L; Dong, LY; Song, T; Dai, SQ				Lei, L; Dong, LY; Song, T; Dai, SQ			Study on the traffic flow of weaving section in elevated road system with cellular automaton model	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton model; elevated road; weaving section		The weaving sections often turn into the bottleneck on the elevated roads. On the basis of the NS cellular automaton traffic model I the weaving section with one-lane main road was simulated and analyzed. For the free traffic flow, weaving almost has no influence on the system, even with increased weaving length. On the other hand, when the traffic flow is in congested state, weaving conflicts have negative effects on the system. The traffic condition will be improved with the increase of weaving length. Our simulation results suggest that the length of weaving sections need not to be inappropriately increased, and a proper moderate value should be chosen to get an optimal traffic condition.

J	Seaid, M				Seaid, Mohammed			Stable numerical methods for conservation laws with discontinuous flux function	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						conservation laws with discontinuous flux function; relaxation approximation; characteristics method; traffic flow models	RELAXATION APPROXIMATIONS; HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS; DIFFERENCE SCHEME; TRAFFIC FLOW; CONVERGENCE; ROADS	We develop numerical methods for solving nonlinear equation's of conservation laws with flux function that depends on discontinuous coefficients. Using a relaxation approximation, the nonlinear equation is transformed to a semilinear diagonalizable problem with linear characteristic variables. Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are used for the advection stage while an implicit-explicit scheme solves the relaxation stage. The main advantages of this approach are neither Riemann problem solvers nor linear iterations are required during the solution process. Moreover, the characteristic-based relaxation method is unconditionally stable such that no CFL conditions are imposed on the selection of time steps. Numerical results are shown for models on traffic flows and two-phase flows. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Hua, W; Liu, J				Hua, W; Liu, J			An implementation of cellular automaton model for single-line train working diagram	CHINESE PHYSICS			English	Article						train working diagram; cellular automaton model; carrying capacity; single-line railway	SIMULATION; FLOW	According to the railway transportation system's characteristics, a new cellular automaton model for the single-line railway system is presented in this paper. Based on this model, several simulations were done to imitate the train operation under three working diagrams. From a different angle the results show how the organization of train operation impacts on the railway carrying capacity. By using the non-parallel train working diagram the influence of fast-train on slow-train is found to be the strongest. Many slow-trains have to wait in-between neighbouring stations to let the fast-train(s) pass through first. So the slow-train will advance like a wave propagating from the departure station to the arrival station. This also resembles the Situation of a highway jammed traffic flow. Furthermore, the nonuniformity of travel times between the sections also greatly limits the railway carrying capacity. After converting the nonuniform sections into the sections with uniform travel times while the total travel time is kept unchanged, all three carrying capacities are improved greatly as shown by simulation. It also shows that the cellular automaton model is an effective and feasible way to investigate the railway transportation system.

J	Akiyama, T; Okushima, M				Akiyama, Takamasa; Okushima, Masashi			Advanced fuzzy traffic controller for urban expressways	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE COMPUTING INFORMATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						fuzzy controller; fuzzy logic; inflow control; genetic algorithm; urban expressway	FREEWAY RAMP CONTROL	Advanced traffic control would be developed as an extension of practical fuzzy control for urban, expressways in the study. Since the uniform toll system at entrances is adopted in Japanese urban expressways, the toll booths are installed at the ramp ways to the expressway. Therefore, the inflow traffic control with toll booth operations has been applied to maintain, smooth and safe traffic on the expressway. In particular, the discrete inflow control has been, applied to real operations with restriction of traffic flow on the expressway. As the number of opening booths is decreased at the entrance, the inflow traffic can be restricted with proper level. Referring to the operations in the real world, the discrete traffic control with decision of human operators has been formulated by the fuzzy control approach by the authors in the late 1980's. It is summarized as significant results of this research that the essential traffic control for urban expressway can be discussed based on. the fuzzy control formulations. Recently, background of traffic control has drastically changed. In, particular, the rapid progress of intelligent information technologies can be seen even in the field of traffic control. Therefore, the advanced traffic control is required as a sort of intelligent transport system (ITS). On the other hand, the methods of fuzzy reasoning have been summarized from many applications in the practical fields. According to the purpose, the advanced inflow traffic controller would be proposed corresponding to the recent progress of traffic control technologies as well as soft-computing. In terms of technology, the continuous traffic control becomes available in place of the discrete control. It means that, an advanced inflow traffic control can be formulated by fuzzy logic reflecting the complicated environment of traffic on the real urban network in the study. The flexible and robust traffic controller can be created with the formulation of fuzzy logic. Furthermore, the optimization, of parameters for an efficient traffic controller can, be performed by genetic algorithm (GA) as well. The fuzzy traffic controller is evaluated through the estimation of traffic condition by the traffic simulation, for urban expressways. Therefore, it can be summarized from the above results that, the recent, progress in information technology and soft-computing produces the superior traffic controller for urban expressway with the formulation of fuzzy control. Finally, the advantages of fuzzy inflow traffic controller can, be summarized in comparison to the discrete controller as a, conventional method. The numerical example of traffic control should be provided, corresponding to the real urban expressway database. It would be confirmed that the advanced inflow controller provides efficient traffic flow on the urban, expressway even with the complexity of the real world.

J	Ghosh-Dastidar, S; Adeli, H				Ghosh-Dastidar, S; Adeli, H			Neural network-wavelet microsimulation model for delay and queue length estimation at freeway work zones	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article						traffic flow; traffic congestion; traffic delay; highway construction; models; neural networks; simulation; workspace	TRAFFIC FLOW	Recently, the writers developed a new mesoscopic-wavelet model for simulating freeway traffic flow patterns and extracting congestion characteristics. As an extension of that research, in this paper, a new neural network-wavelet microsimulation model is presented to track the travel time of each individual vehicle for traffic delay and queue length estimation at work zones. The model incorporates the dynamics of a single vehicle in changing traffic flow conditions. The extracted congestion characteristics obtained from the mesoscopic-wavelet model are used in a Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation (BP) neural network for classifying the traffic flow as free flow, transitional flow, and congested flow with stationary queue. The neural network model is trained using simulated data and tested using both simulated and real data. The computational model presented is applied to five examples of freeways with two and three lanes and one lane closure with varying entry flow or demand patterns. The new microsimulation model is more accurate than macroscopic models and substantially more efficient than microscopic models.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Hiller, A; Rehborn, H				Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Hiller, A; Rehborn, H			Microscopic features of moving traffic jams	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							SINGLE-VEHICLE DATA; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; STATES; FLOW; PHYSICS	Empirical and numerical microscopic features of moving traffic jams are presented. Based on a single vehicle data analysis, it is found that within wide moving jams, i.e., between the upstream and downstream jam fronts there is a complex microscopic spatiotemporal structure. This jam structure consists of alternations of regions in which traffic flow is interrupted and flow states of low speeds associated with "moving blanks" within the jam. Moving blanks within a wide moving jam resemble electron holes in the valence band of semiconductors: As the moving blanks that propagate upstream appear due to downstream vehicle motion within the jam, so appearance of electron holes moving with the electric field results from electron motion against the electric field in the valence band of semiconductors. Empirical features of moving blanks are found. Based on microscopic models in the context of the Kerner's three-phase traffic theory, physical reasons for moving blanks emergence within wide moving jams are disclosed. Microscopic nonlinear effects of moving jam emergence, propagation, and dissolution as well as a diverse variety of hysteresis effects in freeway traffic associated with phase transitions and congested traffic propagation are numerically investigated. Microscopic structure of moving jam fronts is numerically studied and compared with empirical results.

J	Innamaa, S				Innamaa, Satu			Effect of monitoring system structure on short-term prediction of highway travel time	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						travel time; prediction; monitoring system; highway		This article discusses how the structure of the measurement system affects the short-term forecasts of travel time based on it. The effects of section length and location of different measurement stations were investigated. The study used empirical data. The research was carried out on a 28-km long interurban two-lane highway section. The prediction models were made as feedforward multilayer perceptron neural networks. The main results showed that the division of long road sections into shorter sub-links in the travel time measurement system was important. Furthermore, it would be crucial to obtain information about traffic flow rates entering the section in order to time the start of congestion correctly. In conclusion, the structure of the monitoring system should be based on the analysis of a typical location and the development of congestion along the section.

J	Yi, JG; Horowitz, R				Yi, Jingang; Horowitz, Roberto			Macroscopic traffic flow propagation stability for adaptive cruise controlled vehicles	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						traffic propagation stability; adaptive cruise control (ACC); traffic flow; wavefront expansion; intelligent transportation systems (ITS)	TIME	Traffic flow propagation stability is concerned about whether a traffic flow perturbation will propagate and form a traffic shockwave. In this paper, we discuss a general approach to the macroscopic traffic flow propagation stability for adaptive cruise controlled (ACC) vehicles. We present a macroscopic model with velocity saturation for traffic flow in which each individual vehicle is controlled by an adaptive cruise control spacing policy. A nonlinear traffic flow stability criterion is investigated using a wavefront expansion technique. Quantitative relationships between traffic flow stability and model parameters (such as traffic flow and speed, etc.) are derived for a generalized ACC traffic flow model. The newly derived stability results are in agreement with previously derived results that were obtained using both microscopic and macroscopic models with a constant time headway (CTH) policy. Moreover, the stability results derived in this paper provide sufficient and necessary conditions for ACC traffic flow stability and can be used to design other ACC spacing policies.

Furthermore, the response of models to 'what if scenarios' was also examined. The ANN was based on a training procedure using measurements collected in a specific street canyon (benzene concentrations, traffic density, vehicle's type distribution). The DET model was based on road traffic emission rate, wind speed and direction, and the geometrical characteristics of the road. Although both model, produced very good results, given the limited amount of data available, the ANN succeeded slightly better than DET in predicting benzene concentrations. On the other hand, the ANN is less able to reproduce the effect of significant changes in traffic flow patterns on benzene concentrations. The results from the simulations indicate that the ANN is a promising technique for benzene modeling in an urban environment and in can be used for environmental management purposes.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Hiller, A				Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Hiller, A			Criterion for traffic phases in single vehicle data and empirical test of a microscopic three-phase traffic theory	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; FLOW; PHYSICS; MODEL	Based on empirical and numerical microscopic analyses, the physical nature of a qualitatively different behaviour of the wide moving jam phase in comparison with the synchronized flow phase-microscopic traffic flow interruption within the wide moving jam phase-is found. A microscopic criterion for distinguishing the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases in single vehicle data measured at a single freeway location is presented. Based on this criterion, empirical microscopic classification of different local congested traffic states is performed. Simulations made show that the microscopic criterion and macroscopic spatiotemporal objective criteria lead to the same identification of the synchronized flow and wide moving jam phases in congested traffic. Microscopic models in the context of three-phase traffic theory have been tested based on the microscopic criterion for the phases in congested traffic. It is found that microscopic three-phase traffic models can explain both microscopic and macroscopic empirical congested pattern features. It is obtained that microscopic frequency distributions for vehicle speed difference as well as fundamental diagrams and speed correlation functions can depend on the spatial co-ordinate considerably. It turns out that microscopic optimal velocity (OV) functions and time headway distributions are not necessarily qualitatively different, even if local congested traffic states are qualitatively different. The reason for this is that important spatiotemporal features of congested traffic patterns are lost in these as well as in many other macroscopic and microscopic traffic characteristics, which are widely used as the empirical basis for a test of traffic flow models, specifically, cellular automata traffic flow models.

Safety benefits of ramp metering are quantified in terms of the reduced crash potential estimated by the real-time crash prediction model. Driver responses to ramp metering and the consequent traffic flow changes were observed using a microscopic traffic simulation model and crash potential was estimated for a 14.8 kin section of 1-880 in Hayward, California and a hypothetical isolated on-ramp network. The results showed that ramp metering reduced crash potential by 5-37% compared to the no-control case. It was found that safety benefits of local ramp metering strategy were only restricted to the freeway sections in the vicinity of the ramp, and were highly dependent on the existing traffic conditions and the spatial extent over which the evaluation was conducted.

J	Zhang, JL; Ioannou, PA				Zhang, JL; Ioannou, PA			Longitudinal control of heavy trucks in mixed traffic: Environmental and fuel economy considerations	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						adaptive control; automated highway systems; emission; fuel economy; vehicle automation	VEHICLES; MODEL	In this paper, longitudinal vehicle-following controllers for heavy trucks with different spacing policies are designed, analyzed, simulated, and experimentally tested, and their performance in mixed traffic with passenger vehicles is evaluated. A new vehicle-following controller for trucks, which has better properties than existing ones with respect to performance and impact on fuel economy and pollution during traffic disturbances, is developed. The response of trucks to disturbances caused by lead passenger vehicles is smooth due to the limited acceleration capabilities of trucks whether they are manual or equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC) systems. Vehicles following the truck are therefore presented with a smoother speed trajectory to track. This filtering effect of trucks is shown to have beneficial effects on fuel economy and pollution. However, it creates large intervehicle gaps that invite cut-ins from neighboring lanes, creating additional disturbances. These cut-ins, under certain realistic scenarios, may reduce any benefits obtained by the smooth response of trucks as well as increase travel time. The results of this paper indicate possible benefits trucks may have in mixed traffic and also reinforces what is already known-that trucks could be detrimental to traffic flow.

J	Kang, KP; Chang, GL				Kang, KP; Chang, GL			A robust model for optimal time-of-day speed control at highway work zones	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						posted speed limit; robustness approach; time-of-day speed control; variable speed limit; work-zone operation		This paper proposes a new speed control strategy, named time-of-day speed limit (TOD SL) control, for highway work-zone operations. The main purposes of the TOD SL control are to overcome the difficulty in setting the optimal real-time speed limit due to the lack of detectors and to maximize the use of available data such as the historical volume data on the target work zone. Its core logic is to divide the entire day of operations into a number of control periods and to accommodate the time-varying traffic conditions within each control period. The measure of effectiveness (MOE) selected in the TOD SL model takes into account both the operational efficiency and traffic safety. To encompass all possible traffic conditions during each control period, the control model employs traffic flow relations calibrated from historical data to estimate the speed and density data with available volume under possible traffic scenarios. The performance of the proposed TOD SL control has been evaluated with the simulation experiments and compared with the other speed control strategies based on the selected measures of effectiveness.

J	Sun, SL; Zhang, CS; Yu, GQ				Sun, SL; Zhang, CS; Yu, GQ			A Bayesian network approach to traffic flow forecasting	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Bayesian network; expectation maximization algorithm; Gaussian mixture model; traffic flow forecasting	PREDICTION	A new approach based on Bayesian networks for traffic flow forecasting is proposed. In this paper, traffic flows among adjacent road links in a transportation network are modeled as a Bayesian network. The joint probability distribution between the cause nodes (data utilized for forecasting) and the effect node (data to be forecasted) in a constructed Bayesian network is described as a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) whose parameters are estimated via the competitive expectation maximization (CEM) algorithm. Finally, traffic flow forecasting is performed under the criterion of minimum mean square error (mmse). The approach departs from many existing traffic flow forecasting models in that it explicitly includes information from adjacent road links to analyze the trends of the current link statistically. Furthermore, it also encompasses the issue of traffic flow forecasting when incomplete data exist Comprehensive experiments on urban vehicular traffic flow data of Beijing and comparisons with several other methods show that the Bayesian network is a very promising and effective approach for traffic flow modeling and forecasting, both for complete data and incomplete data.

J	Hereth, WR; Zundel, A; Saito, M				Hereth, WR; Zundel, A; Saito, M			Automated estimation of average stopped delay at signalized intersections using digitized still-image analysis of actual traffic flow	JOURNAL OF COMPUTING IN CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article						automation; traffic signals; interactions; digital techniques; traffic flow		Average stopped delay for a given signalized intersection approach is the average time a vehicle waits at a traffic light and constitutes a part of the measure of effectiveness of signalized intersections. The exploratory work done by two of the writers of this paper using images created by the animation feature of CORSIM traffic simulation software indicated that such application can actually produce stopped delay estimates commensurate with the results of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) method. However, CORSIM simulation images do not have parallax problems, and vehicle color and size and pavement color were practically the same for the entire evaluation field. The three methods (gap, gap-hybrid, and motion) developed in this study are able to overcome these problems associated with actual traffic flow images at an acceptable level. The methods were tested with two image data sets taken at two different locations with different camera angles. The performance of the three methods varies depending on the quality of image, camera angle, and calibrated parameter values used for each method, but in both cases they were able to produce average stopped delays similar to those estimated by the ITE manual method. At present the software that executes the three methods allows the user to analyze one approach lane at a time using digitized still images taken from analog video films; however, the software can be expanded to analyze multiple approach lanes and digital images dynamically fed by digital traffic monitoring cameras. With this automated procedure the traffic engineer can estimate average stopped delays in his or her office, greatly saving time, money, and the manpower necessary for conducting field data collections.

At each sample location, we constructed circular buffers in a geographic information system and captured information on roads, traffic flow, land use, population and housing. Using multiple linear regression, we were able to predict 79% of the variation in NO2 levels with four variables: traffic density within 40-300m of the sampling location, traffic density within 300-1000m, length of road within 40m and distance to the Paci. c coast. Applying this model to validation samples showed that the model predicted NO2 levels within, on average, 2.1 p.p.b for 12 training sites initially excluded from t he model. Our evaluation of this land use regression model showed that this method had excellent prediction and robustness in a North American context. These models may be useful tools in evaluating health effects of long-term exposure to traffic-related pollution.

J	Tian, ZZ; Wu, N				Tian, ZZ; Wu, N			Probabilistic model for signalized intersection capacity with a short right-turn lane	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								The paper presents a capacity estimation model for a signalized intersection approach with a short right-turn lane. The proposed model overcomes one of the major shortcomings of the current capacity estimation methodologies by considering the probabilistic nature of traffic flow and the effect of queue blockage to the short-lane section. The research showed that the capacity of a signalized intersection with a short right-turn lane is strongly related to the length of the short lane, the proportion of through and right-turn vehicles, and cycle length. The study also revealed new findings, through simulation, on the saturation flow rate discharging from the single-lane section where the right-turn lane splits. It was found that the saturation flow rate increases with the increase of the length of the right-turn lane. The proposed model was validated against the results from CORSIM, a microscopic traffic simulation model, and found general agreement between the two results. Capacity enhancement is achieved with a short right-turn lane compared to the shared-lane situation. Such a capacity enhancement is contributed by both the short-lane usage and the increased saturation flow rate from the single-lane section. An example of a common application of the proposed model is to provide adequate design of the length of the right-turn lane so that the projected traffic demand can be accommodated at an acceptable service level while minimizing the cost associated with the construction of a full or longer right-turn lane.

Numerical approximations of a traffic flow model on networks	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						Scalar conservation laws; traffic flow; fluid-dynamic models; finite differences schemes; boundary conditions	CONSERVATION-LAWS; KINETIC APPROXIMATION; WAVES; ROADS	We consider a mathematical model for fluid-dynamic flows on networks which is based on conservation laws. Road networks are considered as graphs composed by arcs that meet at some junctions. The crucial point is represented by junctions, where interactions occur and the problem is under-determined. The approximation of scalar conservation laws along arcs is carried out by using conservative methods, such as the classical Godunov scheme and the more recent discrete velocities kinetic schemes with the use of suitable boundary conditions at junctions. Riemann problems are solved by means of a simulation algorithm which proceeds processing each junction. We present the algorithm and its application to some simple test cases and to portions of urban network.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, LC			Effect of cooperative merging on the synchronous flow phase of traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic model; traffic flow; traffic dynamics; congested flow	MODEL; SIMULATION	Cooperation in merging is introduced by adding interactions between pairs of vehicles in opposite lanes. Simulations with an improved version of the modified optimal velocity model are done for two lanes merging into a single lane. For similar to 30 s prior to reaching the merge region, vehicles in both lanes adjust their headways to create safe distances in front of and behind the merging vehicle. Cooperation prevents the transition from free flow to synchronous flow that occurs for normal merging, provided the merge region is sufficiently large and the total incoming flow does not exceed the maximum possible single-lane flow. No long-range vehicleto-vehicle communication is required for the type of cooperation considered. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that, depending on the traffic densities in the two roads, density waves can form in the traffic circle and in one or both of the roads. Depending on the expression chosen for the optimal velocity, either the congestion moves entirely to the traffic circle or the congestion becomes confined to the traffic circle and a part of the road approaching the traffic circle.

J	Yang, JG; Deng, W; Wang, JM; Li, QF; Wang, ZA				Yang, JG; Deng, W; Wang, JM; Li, QF; Wang, ZA			Modeling pedestrians' road crossing behavior in traffic system micro-simulation in China	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						microscopic simulation; modelling; pedestrian; traffic violation		In many Chinese cities, pedestrian's road crossing behavior is different from that of pedestrians in developed countries. This paper presents a pedestrian model for traffic system micro-simulation in China. Considering the high rate of signal non-compliance, we classify pedestrians into two types: law-obeying ones and opportunistic ones. Opportunistic ones decide whether to violate traffic signal during red man, depending on the states of some external factors (like policeman, vehicle flow and other pedestrians' behaviors). Questionnaires were used to determine the proportions of these two types of pedestrians under different circumstances. In addition, a time gap distribution extracted from videotape were used to determine the criterion for pedestrians to decide whether to walk or wait when they conflict with vehicle flows. However, simulation results deviate from the data extracted from videotape in some degree. By adjusting the parameters on the basis of analyzing the occurrence of the deviations, the simulation results agree with the field results better. This model has represented the high rate of pedestrians' red light running and the mixed characteristics of traffic flows in Chinese cities, and it may be applicable in the micro-simulation of traffic system in other developing cities.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL				Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL			Deterministic microscopic three-phase traffic flow models	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							SPATIAL-TEMPORAL PATTERNS; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; AGGREGATION; DYNAMICS; PHYSICS; WAVES	Two different deterministic microscopic traffic flow models, which are in the context of the Kerner's there-phase traffic theory, are introduced. In an acceleration time delay model (ATD model), different time delays in driver acceleration associated with driver behaviour in various local driving situations are explicitly incorporated into the model. Vehicle acceleration depends on local traffic situation, i.e., whether a driver is within the free flow or synchronized flow or else wide moving jam traffic phase. In a speed adaptation model (SA model), vehicle speed adaptation occurs in synchronized flow depending on driving conditions. It is found that the ATD and SA models show spatiotemporal congested traffic patterns that are adequate with empirical results. In the ATD and SA models, the onset of congestion in free flow at a freeway bottleneck is associated with a first-order phase transition from free flow to synchronized flow; moving jams emerge spontaneously in synchronized flow only. Differences between the ATD and SA models are studied. A comparison of the ATD and SA models with stochastic models in the context of three-phase traffic theory is made.

These features affect dramatically the behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this article, we present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global epidemics that considers the complete worldwide air travel infrastructure complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global epidemic modeling: (i) we study the role of the large scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of emerging diseases; and (ii) we evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission and traffic flows. To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.

If such models are to be used within a decision-making context, their evaluation for a range of urban geometries should be undertaken. In this work a k-epsilon flow model coupled with a Lagrangian stochastic dispersion model are used to model the flow and dispersion of a traffic-related pollutant in a complex urban street canyon within the city of York, UK. The results are compared with measurements of mean wind, turbulence and carbon monoxide concentrations from a field experiment. For comparison, measured concentrations were normalised by the background wind speed and an estimate of the traffic emissions based on traffic flows. The normalisation was found to be inapplicable at background wind speeds below 2 m s(-1) and therefore comparisons are restricted to higher wind speeds. The mean flow is found to be well predicted by the model and helps to interpret complex flow structures in the street, which contained vertical recirculation, corner vortices, channelling and convergence. The modelled worst case concentrations are generally higher than the measurements which could potentially be due in part to the reduced vertical velocities in the model and lower levels of predicted turbulence for certain background wind conditions when compared to the field data. Sensitivity analysis suggests that the modelled concentrations are fairly robust with respect to changes in grid resolution and upwind velocity profiles. The variability of the normalised measured concentrations was high, which is thought to be due to variability within the traffic emissions due to the presence of different traffic regimes, as well as large-scale turbulence within the background flow.

J	Mak, CL; Fan, HSL				Mak, CL; Fan, HSL			Single-station algorithm using video-based data for detecting expressway incidents	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							NEURAL-NETWORK; MODEL; FREEWAYS	Most automatic incident detection algorithms were successfully developed using loop-detector-based traffic measurements collected from their own localities. But their detection performances were not satisfactory when applied on data collected using a video-based detector system. The video-based detector system is gaining popularity as it was reported to be cost-effective, less prone to damage compared to loop detectors embedded in road pavement, and possesses surveillance capability. It is able to provide the homogeneity of traffic measurements with greater reliability in non-incident situations. In this study, a simple detection rule was used to develop algorithms that use video-based data for detecting lane-blocking incidents. A set of 96 incidents from Singapore's Central Expressway was used for calibrating these algorithms, with another 64 incidents for validation. Two single-station algorithms, named dual-variable (DV) and flow-based DV algorithms were developed. They have similar detection logic, but the latter includes a pre-incident traffic flow condition in its detection framework. On average, the flow-based DV algorithm outperformed the DV algorithm, and both proved to be effective techniques when compared to some existing loop-detector-based algorithms.

J	Cho, KY; Kwon, SJ; Suh, MW				Cho, KY; Kwon, SJ; Suh, MW			Development of MATDYMO (Multi-Agent for Traffic Simulation with Vehicle Dynamics Model) I: Development of traffic environment	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						vehicle dynamics; multi-agent; traffic simulation; virtual driving lane; interrupted flow model; uninterrupted flow model		For decades, simulation technique has been well validated in areas such as computer and communication systems. Recently, the technique has been much used in the area of transportation and traffic forecasting. Several methods have been proposed for investigating complex traffic flows. However, the dynamics of vehicles and diversities of driver characteristics have never been considered sufficiently in these methods, although they are considered important factors in traffic flow analysis. In this paper, we propose a traffic simulation tool called Multi-Agent for Traffic Simulation with Vehicle Dynamics Model (MATDYMO). Road transport consultants, traffic engineers and urban traffic control center managers are expected to use MATDYMO to efficiently simulate traffic flow. MATDYMO has four sub systems: the road management system, the vehicle motion control system, the driver management system, and the integration control system. The road management system simulates traffic flow for various traffic environments (e.g., multi-lane roads, nodes, virtual lanes, and signals); the vehicle motion control system constructs the vehicle agent by using various vehicle dynamic models; the driver management system constructs the driver agent capable of having different driving styles; and lastly, the integrated control system regulates the MATDYMO as a whole and observes the agents running in the system. The vehicle motion control system and driver management system are described in the companion paper. An interrupted and uninterrupted flow model were simulated, and the simulation results were verified by comparing them with the results from a commercial software, TRANSYT-7F. The simulation result of the uninterrupted flow model showed that the driver agent displayed human-like behavior ranging from slow and careful driving to fast and aggressive driving. The Simulation of the interrupted flow model was implemented as two cases. The first case analyzed traffic flow as the traffic signals changed at different intervals and as the turning traffic volume changed. Second case analyzed the traffic flow as the traffic signals changed at different intervals and as the road length changed. The simulation results of the interrupted flow model showed that the close relationship between traffic state change and traffic signal interval.

J	Zheng, WZ; Lee, DH; Shi, QX				Zheng, WZ; Lee, DH; Shi, QX			Short-term freeway traffic flow prediction: Bayesian combined neural network approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							MODELS; VOLUME	Short-term traffic flow prediction has long been regarded as a critical concern for intelligent transportation systems. On the basis of many existing prediction models, each having good performance only in a particular period, an improved approach is to combine these single predictors together for prediction in a span of periods. In this paper, a neural network model is introduced that combines the prediction from single neural network predictors according to an adaptive and heuristic credit assignment algorithm based on the theory of conditional probability and Bayes' rule. Two single predictors, i.e., the back propagation and the radial basis function neural networks are designed and combined linearly into a Bayesian combined neural network model. The credit value for each predictor in the combined model is calculated according to the proposed credit assignment algorithm and largely depends on the accumulative prediction performance of these predictors during the previous prediction intervals. For experimental test, two data sets comprising traffic flow rates in 15-min time intervals have been collected from Singapore's Ayer Rajah Expressway. One data set is used to train the two single neural networks and the other to test and compare the performances between the combined and singular models. Three indices, i.e., the mean absolute percentage error, the variance of absolute percentage error, and the probability of percentage error, are employed to compare the forecasting performance. It is found that most of the time, the combined model outperforms the singular predictors. More importantly, for a given time period, it is the role of this newly proposed model to track the predictors' performance online, so as to always select and combine the best-performing predictors for prediction.

J	Pan, QS				Pan, QS			Freight data assembling and modeling: Methodologies and practice	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						freight model; origin-destination matrix; commodity flows; GIS; data processing		In comparison to personal travel, freight movements within large metropolitan areas are much less studied. Most conventional transportation models and planning analysis that disregarded freight flows have been criticized on the plausibility of their results and conclusions. To alleviate these problems, this study proposes a non-survey based approach to assemble and process freight data in a systematic way. A freight origin-destination (OD) matrix of freight flows can be developed using secondary data sources. The estimated freight flows can be loaded together with conventional passenger flows onto the regional highway network of a large metropolitan area. As a case study, this non-survey based approach was applied to build a freight OD and study the traffic flows in Los Angeles. It concluded that this approach can be used to analyze urban freight movement in a low-cost way in which planning agencies can overcome the common omission of freight flow information in their transportation plans.

With the increase of transportation, an effective traffic prediction allows to prevent traffic problems. This research aims to propose a novel approach to traffic prediction using Ying-Yang Fuzzy Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (YY-FCAMC). The model is motivated from the famous Chinese ancient Ying-Yang philosophy, which views everything as a product of conflict-harmony process between Ying and Yang. That principle is applied to find the optimal number of clusters and fuzzy sets in the fuzzification phase of the hybrid fuzzy-neural YY-FCMAC network. The analyzed experiment on a set Of real traffic data flow of the east-bound Pan Island Expressway (PIE) in Singapore shows the effectiveness of the YY-FCMAC in universal approximation and prediction.

In order to investigate vehicular networking protocols and evaluate the effects of incremental deployment it is essential to have a topology-aware simulation and test-bed infrastructure. While several traffic simulators have been developed under the Intelligent Transport System initiative, their primary motivation has been to model and forecast vehicle traffic flow and congestion from a queuing perspective. GrooveNet is a hybrid simulator which enables communication between simulated vehicles, real vehicles and between real and simulated vehicles. By modeling inter-vehicular communication within a real street map-based topography it facilitates protocol design and also in-vehicle deployment. GrooveNet's modular architecture incorporates mobility, trip and message broadcast models over a variety of link and physical layer communication models. It is easy to run simulations of thousands of vehicles in any US city and to add new models for networking, security, applications and vehicle interaction. GrooveNet supports multiple network interfaces, GPS and events triggered from the vehicle's on-board computer. Through simulation, we are able to study the message latency, and coverage under various traffic conditions. On-road tests over 400 miles lend insight to required market penetration.

The lighting in a road should provide "safe driving conditions" on entry to the tunnel for all values of "open-road" luminance whilst obtaining maximum economy in capital, operating and maintenance costs [1]. The recommendation by Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) on luminance of different lighting zones in a road tunnel is introduced at first. Then, prior to designing the fuzzy control model, a configuration layout of the lighting system including luminance sensing node, traffic sensing node, lamp control node is constructed. Based on the layout that offers the assignment of sensing nodes and control nodes, a fuzzy logic control model is developed. Membership functions of quantity of vehicles passed per hour and velocity of traffic flow are physically submitted in order to setup the fuzzy logic rules. Timing and spacing filtering in terms of weighting approach is employed in traffic information process in front of fuzzy control logic. The weight of filters is controlled by a so called "zone deduction logic", which also be used to select the luminance calculation equations.

This paper presents a method for traffic flow map using the data received from the GPS mobile terminals equipped vehicles. Firstly, a vehicle real-time monitoring GPS system is given. Secondly, a mart-matching method was proposed, which eliminated ineffective data by observing the vehicles status and calculated link time cost of each probe vehicle and the average speed. The equation of speed-flow relationship established by observing traffic data, especially the general one established in conditions of any traffic roads under any traffic burden conditions. Thirdly, it developed a dynamic traffic flow map arithmetic based on the results above and successfully solved the questions: data collecting, traffic barrier-free conditions processing and traffic flow map calculating. Finally, the results of simulation experiment indicate that the methods are effective and practical. It can be used as a new real-time network method to control the traffic signal, which is different from the traffic signal controlled method that depends on the timer or road linear controller method.

Three main components, network control objectives, control strategies and network flow models, are critical in it. This study selects the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe traffic flow characteristics and develops an optimal control model using one kind of network throughput performance indices, system dispersal time (SDT), as the control objective. Signal timing plans are calculated by gene algorithm optimization with common cycle strategy and these timing plans are evaluated by VISSIM at last. By regularization method analysis, the dispersal trajectory characteristics are derived out. Results show that a proper non-maximum cycle length will disperse congested network vehicles rapidly and a better fixed signal timing strategy will always try to disperse the congested vehicles in the congestion prophase.

Road map extraction using GMTI tracking	2006 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION FUSION, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	9th International Conference on Information Fusion	JUL 10, 2006	Florence, ITALY			tracking; road extraction; ground moving target indication radar (GMTI); retrodiction		For analyzing dynamic scenarios with many ground moving vehicles, airborne Ground Moving Target Indicator (GMTI) radar is well-suited due to its wide-area, all-weather, day/night, and real time capabilities. The generation of GMTI tracks from these data is the backbone for producing a "recognized ground picture" as well as for analyzing traffic flows. In this paper we dicuss the benefits of GMTI tracking in view of extracting road map information. The resulting tracking-generated road maps are highly up-to-date and fairly precise. Moreover, their accuracy is quantitatively described. The precision of the extracted road segments can significantly be improved using smoothed or "retrodicted" tracks. In turn, the extracted road information is exploited for the precise tracking of succeeding road targets. The proposed approach is illustrated by a simulated example including Doppler and terrain obscuration, providing hints to the achievable road map accuracies.

The model is based on the idea of dividing a freeway trunk in sections covered by the cells of the wireless network and associated with state variables describing density of vehicles, mean velocity, and percentage of active mobile phones. Using the density and hand-off measurements from the cellular network, the parameters of such model are identified via an algorithm based on stochastic approximation.

In this paper, we study a fairly restrictive scenario "Stop and Go" in city driving. We assume that slowing down and stopping will be accomplished by the automated system (adaptive cruise control). The starting and acceleration of the car will be controlled by the human driver. A simple human driver model is used to represent the reactions of the driver. The traffic flow consists of automated and manual controlled vehicles. A traffic simulator is developed to simulate the city driving scenario and various traffic flows. Both a totally isolated car (without cooperation) and then the possibility of cooperation through wireless with cars ahead are considered.

The traffic model is formulated as one with stochastic and nonlinear properties. The control objective is to maintain the freeway operated at a desired traffic density and to diminish the queue length on the ramp as possible. Such a nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem is known hard to solve exactly, then we concentrate on providing approximate solution. Our approach consists of two steps: the first is to solve a finite-horizon optimal control problem based on neural dynamic optimization; the second is to adapt the finite-horizon optimal controller to work for the infinite-horizon case by using the recedinghorizon control mechanism. We choose the multilayer feedforward neural network as the approximating structure, and the stochastic steepest descent method for the training. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for traffic data analysis. Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is used to reduce data dimensionality and extract features from them, then Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is applied in the unsupervised clustering of links. Subject interpretation and regression equations are used to analyze the clustering result. Case studies on real data from UTC-SCOOT System in Beijing prove that the proposed method is effective in extracting non-linear relations between different links and revealing hidden patterns in traffic flow data. The result yielded can support further analysis, like traffic parameter forecasting and traffic flow control.

The objective is to provide a new description of the dynamic phenomena which govern traffic flows starting from a phenomenological representation of vehicle flow transfers in a traffic network. Among the attractions of using a bond graph approach are, the underlying graphical vision which contributes to crystallizing the analysis, the systematic formulation of the analytical models of traffic flow and its broad applicability across all engineering's fields. As such, Bond Graphs enormously facilitate the integration task of road activity in the supply Chain.

The proposed model is composed of two modular. One is a fuzzy network (FN), which is used for fuzzy clustering. Each cluster represents one kind of specific traffic pattern. The other is a neural network (NN), which is one-layer network and is used for partitioning the relationship of input and output vector. And the FIN module supervises the learning of the NN. That is, the features of the traffic samples are employed to guide the training of the NN. Moreover, an on-line iterative predictive algorithm is presented in this paper to predict the traffic flow according to the sampled data of the upstream cross roads. Finally, the real sampled traffic flow data is employed to validate the proposed method. Results show that the proposed traffic flow prediction strategy based on fuzzy neural network model is feasible and effective.

Most existing freeway traffic flow control relies on centralized scheme to adjust the control variable in order to enhance efficiency and avoid congestions. The paper devises a cellular framework and decentralized control scheme for traffic flow control so that the control scheme does not rely on global information. The proposed control scheme exploits neighboring cellular information and sliding mode control technique to prevent the buildup of traffic flow and aggravating propagation of shock waves. The proposed traffic flow, controller is simulated to show its effectiveness in attenuating shock waves and fluctuations.

It is very important to freeway incident management system that incident is detected quickly and exactly. In order to realize automatic incident detection (AID), usually a set of vehicle detector need to be set every 500-2000 meters on the freeway. But now, in many countries, the factual detectors on the freeways are few, which can't meet the above needs. Most of freeway toll collection systems in many countries adopt close toll collection fashion. The establishment of computer toll collection system is perfect, and plenty of traffic flow information can be obtained from the toll collection system. This paper first brings forward the AID algorithm based on the mainline detector information and ramp toll collection information, which utilizes information fusion to realize freeway automatic incident detection and consequently improves the performance of incident detection algorithm. The algorithm can decrease interference to traffic flow when the detectors are being set. The paper studies the four freeway automatic incident detection algorithms whose input data are the mainline information, toll collection information and both information fused as data-laver fusion and character-layer fusion, respectively. As the result of simulation is shown, the performances of the freeway AID algorithm based on information fusion are better than those of the AID algorithms based on mainline information or the AID algorithms based on ramp toll collection information. And the performances of the freeway AID algorithm based on character-layer information fusion are better than those of the AID algorithms based on data-layer information fusion. The detect rate (DR) of the algorithm based on character layer information fusion is 93% and its false alarm rate (FAR) is 0.67%. The AID algorithm has a good potential application in practice.
