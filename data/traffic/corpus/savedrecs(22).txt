J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Jamming transition in a two-dimensional traffic flow model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; SELF-ORGANIZATION; JAMS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION; DYNAMICS; HIGHWAY; RULES	Phase transition and critical phenomenon are investigated in the two-dimensional traffic flow numerically and analytically. The one-dimensional lattice hydrodynamic model of traffic is extended to the two-dimensional traffic flow in which there are two types of cars (northbound and eastbound cars). It is shown that the phase transition among the freely moving phase, the coexisting phase, and the uniformly congested phase occurs below the critical point. Above the critical point, no phase transition occurs. The value a, of the critical point decreases as increasing fraction c of the eastbound cars for c less than or equal to 0.5. The linear stability theory is applied. The neutral stability lines are found. The time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation is derived by the use of nonlinear analysis. The phase separation lines, the spinodal lines, and the critical point are calculated from the TDGL equation. [S1063-651X(99)00405-5].

J	Lee, HY; Lee, HW; Kim, D				Lee, HY; Lee, HW; Kim, D			Dynamic states of a continuum traffic equation with on-ramp	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; FLOW; MODEL; JAMS	We study the phase diagram of the continuum traffic flow model of a highway with an on-ramp. Using an open boundary condition, traffic states and metastabilities are investigated numerically for several representative values of the upstream boundary flux f(up) and for the whole range of the on-ramp flux f(up). An inhomogeneous but time-independent traffic state (standing localized cluster state) is found and related to a recently measured traffic state. Due to the density gradient near the on-ramp, a traffic jam can occur even when the downstream density is below the critical density of the usual traffic jam formation in homogeneous highways, and its structure varies qualitatively with f(rmp). The free flow, the recurring hump (RH) state, and the traffic jam can all coexist in a certain metastable region where the free flow can undergo phase transitions either to the RH state or to the traffic jam state. We also find two nontrivial analytic solutions. These solutions correspond to the standing localized cluster state and the homogeneous congested traffic state (one form of the traffic jam), which are observed in numerical simulations.

J	Verhoef, ET				Verhoef, ET			Time, speeds, flows and densities in static models of road traffic congestion and congestion pricing	REGIONAL SCIENCE AND URBAN ECONOMICS			English	Article						road traffic congestion; congestion pricing; hypercongestion	GOOD POLICY; POLITICAL FEASIBILITY; ELASTIC DEMAND; BOTTLENECK; ECONOMICS; CURVE	This paper deals with some of the features of static models of road traffic congestion that have caused much debate in the literature. It first focuses on the difficulties arising with the backward-bending cost curve defined over traffic flows in the context of 'continuous congestion'. The relevance of the backward-bending segment of this curve is questioned by demonstrating that the 'equilibria' on this segment of the cost curve are dynamically infeasible. Next, the implications for static models of 'peak congestion' are considered. In doing so, attention is paid also to the implicit assumptions, particularly on the nature of scheduling costs, that are necessary to render static models of peak congestion internally consistent. The paper ends with a brief discussion of the implications for dynamic models of peak congestion. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Jamming transitions and the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation in a two-lane traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; phase transition; critical phenomenon; modified KdV equation	SELF-ORGANIZATION; 2-LANE ROADWAY; MODEL; JAMS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION; HIGHWAY	The two lattice models are presented to simulate the traffic flow on a two-lane highway. They are the lattice versions of the hydrodynamic model of traffic: the one (model A) is described by the differential-difference equation where time is a continuous Variable and space is a discrete Variable, and the other (model B) is the difference equation in which both time and space variables are discrete. The jamming transitions among the freely moving phase, the coexisting phase, and the uniform congested phase are studied by using the nonlinear analysis and the computer simulation. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equations are derived from the lattice models near the critical point. The traffic jam is described by a kink-antikink solution obtained from the MKdV equation. It is found that the critical point, the coexisting curve, and the neutral stability line decrease with increasing the rate of lane changing.

J	Buckland, AT; Middleton, DR				Buckland, AT; Middleton, DR			Nomograms for calculating pollution within street canyons	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						vehicles; dispersion; screening; model; AEOLIUS		The Environment Act 1995 has introduced the notion of local air quality management which requires that air quality in towns be reviewed and assessed. There is a need to identify those streets that are worst affected by vehicular pollutants. Such worst cases are likely to be narrow congested streets with tall buildings on each side. A nomogram presented here allows rapid screening of pollution in congested street canyons. The strong dependence on wind direction is reduced to the two extremes, namely wind along and wind across the canyon. Then canyon concentrations are estimated according to street geometry and traffic flow. The nomogram is designed for use by local authorities, is quick and easy to use, and paper or computer versions are available. It is suggested that detailed monitoring or modelling may only be required when simple screening methods predict high air pollution. Crown copyright (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			TDGL and MKdV equations for jamming transition in the lattice models of traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; phase transition; time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation	FLOW MODELS; JAMS; CONGESTION; DERIVATION; HIGHWAY	The lattice models of traffic are proposed to describe the jamming transition in traffic flow on a highway in terms of thermodynamic terminology of phase transitions and critical phenomena. They are the lattice versions of the hydrodynamic model of traffic. Two lattice models are presented: one is described by the differential-difference equation where time is a continuous variable and space is a discrete variable, and the other is the difference equation in which both time and space variables are discrete. We apply the linear stability theory and the nonlinear analysis to the lattice models. It is shown that the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation is derived to describe the traffic flow near the critical point. A thermodynamic theory is formulated for describing the phase transitions and critical phenomena. It is also shown that the perturbed modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation is derived to describe the traffic jam. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

It has been envisioned that automation could increase highway capacity by a factor of three. The purpose of this paper is to develop a methodology for predicting highway capacity and comparing alternative automation concepts. It extends earlier research on optimal lane assignment on an automated highway to dynamic networks. A path-based linear program is formulated and solved through a column generation method. The algorithm has been applied to networks with as many as 20 on and off ramps, 80 segments, 4 lanes and 12 time periods. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traffic pow is simulated by allowing individual vehicles to move along a highway in a realistic manner. The vehicle movements are based on a fuzzy knowledge based model of highway driver behavior that contains an extensive set of rules covering all aspects of highway driving, including car following, braking, discretionary and mandatory lane changing. Results show that the simulations based on the proposed technique closely resembles the real world traffic flow.

In maritime transportation, traffic control is performed by Vessel Traffic Services (VTS). In search for optimal support for VTS operators, tools are developed constantly. A performance based measurement of situation awareness of VTS operators is used to evaluate changes in the support system. This paper describes a laboratory experiment in a full scale interactive VTS simulator which aims at establishing a base-line measurement of situation awareness for VTS operator performance. A scoring system for VTS operator performance accounts for the specific characteristics of VTS operator work, such as accuracy and relevance of information. Copyright (C) 1998 IFAC.

A traffic-flow simulation was developed and mapped onto a parallel computer architecture. Two algorithms (the 1-step and 2-step algorithms) to solve the simulation equations were developed and implemented. They were then tested on a Gray T3E, a 3-D torroidal mesh with very fast inter-processor communication (IPC) times. Tests with real traffic data collected from the freeway network in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis, MN were used to validate the accuracy and computation rate of the parallel simulation system. The execution time for a 24-hour traffic-flow simulation over a 15.5-mile freeway, which takes 65.7 minutes on a typical single processor computer, took only 2.39 seconds on the Gray T3E. The 2-step algorithm, whose goal is to trade off extra computation for fewer IPC's, was shown to save more than 5% on computation time. This parallel implementation has proven potential for real-time traffic engineering applications.

A traffic-flow simulation rr ns der eloped and mapped onto a parallel computer architecture. Two algorithms (the 1-step and 2-step algorithms) to solve the simulation equations were developed and implemented. They were then tested on an nCUBE2, a 1024 node hypercube with very slow inter-processor communication (IPC) times. Tests with real traffic data collected from the freeway network in the metropolitan area of Minneapolis, Minnesota were used to validate the accuracy and computation rate of the parallel simulation system. The execution time for a 24-hour traffic-flow simulation over a 15.5-mile freeway; which takes 65.7 minutes on a typical single processor computer, took only 88.51 seconds on the nCUBE2. The 2-step algorithm, whose goal is to trade off extra computation for fewer IPC's, was shown to save more than 19% on total execution time.

Based on this investigation, a Kalman filtering algorithm was modified to recursively filter and update aggregate traffic flow and speed data to estimate true values. A test using measured arterial street data at a signalized intersection shows good tracking ability on these traffic variables over time. A test using data from an incident on an arterial street also confirmed that this algorithm has good potential for arterial street incident detection.

One challenge to researchers dealing with transportation is to find efficient ways to model and predict traffic flow, even if the behaviour of people in traffic is not a trivial problem. The social nature of traffic (e.g. coordinated decisions) seems to be a key question, not well explored. We aim at creating a model of drivers as social agents, thus allowing their behaviour to be predicted and considered in the simulation. This may, on its turn, improve the accuracy of the existing Advanced Travel Information Systems (ATIS).

J	Yasdi, R				Yasdi, R			Prediction of road traffic using a neural network approach	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS			English	Article						learning; neural networks; prediction; time series		A key component of the daily operation and planning activities of a traffic control centre is short-term forecasting, i.e. the prediction of daily to the next few days of traffic flow. Such forecasts have a significant impact on the optimal regulation of the road traffic on all kinds of freeways, They are increasingly important in an environment with increasing road traffic problems. The present paper aims at presenting the effectiveness of a neural network system for prediction based on time-series data. We only use one parameter, namely traffic volume for the forecasting. We employ artificial neural networks for traffic forecasting applied on a road section. Recurrent Jordan networks, popular in the modelling of time series, is examined in this study. Simulation results demonstrate that learning with this type of architecture has a good generalisation ability.

These are intended to restore the safety performance of sites to which they are applied to prevailing levels according to their kind, traffic flows and design. This approach is therefore appropriate to sites where the mean accident frequency exceeds a standard value for that site. In this paper, we present analyses that provide quantitative indications of which sites should be considered for this kind of treatment according to their accident record. We describe four measures that are informative in this respect - the count of accidents, an estimate of the mean accident frequency, the amount by which this estimate exceeds a standard value, and the probability that it does so. We illustrate the use of this analysis by applying it to a dataset of accident records of priority controlled road junctions and compare the results of the different analyses.

J	Dial, RB				Dial, RB			Network-optimized road pricing: Part I: A parable and a model	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; EQUILIBRIUM	Part I of a two-part series, this paper recites a parable and formulates a stochastic optimization model that determines optimal link tolls on a road network whose users' value of time is a random variable. The parable, introducing the problem, demonstrates the importance of the variability of the value of time. The model, cast as a variational inequality, becomes a specialized form of a bicriterion user-equilibrium traffic assignment. Its solution is a set of efficient tolls for all links in the network. These tolls induce an equilibrium traffic flow that is at once system-optimal and user-optimal-for all trips, regardless of their value of time. Part II develops a solution algorithm, gives examples, and provides performance statistics.

J	Mahnke, R; Kaupuzs, J				Mahnke, R; Kaupuzs, J			Stochastic theory of freeway traffic	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW; JAMS	Extending a new stochastic approach to congestion in traffic how [R. Mahnke and N. Pieret, Phys. Rev. E 56, 2666 (1997)], the nucleation, growth, and condensation of car clusters in a circular one-lane freeway traffic model is investigated. In analogy to usual aggregation phenomena such as the formation of liquid droplets in supersaturated vapor, the clustering behavior in traffic how is described by the Master equation. At overcritical densities the transition from the initial free-particle situation (free flow of vehicles) to the final congested cluster state, where one big aggregate of cars has been formed, is shown. In dependence on the concentration of cars on the road, the stationary solution of the Master equation is derived analytically. The obtained fundamental diagram as a flow-density relation indicates clearly the different regimes of traffic flow (free jet of cars, coexisting phase of jams and isolated cars, and highly viscous heavy traffic). In the (thermodynamic) Limit of an infinite number of vehicles on an infinitely long road, the analytical solution for the fundamental diagram is in agreement with experimental traffic flow data.

This makes the society pay for the wasting time and lets the air quality get worse. So we design the Intelligent Traffic Control Decision System to evaluate the effect of new traffic control theory. In this paper, we use the control theory of variable signal timing. The system is run in node control if the traffic flow is in normal condition and the system will be changed to network control when the flow is too heavy. We use Visual C++ to implement the ITCDS simulation system and then compare with other systems. Experimental result shows that our system, variable signal timing, has a better effect than other previous systems.

Real world applications of these models require the ability to model traffic in networks, which has been an important research topic lately. We focus on the problem of travel demand generation in transportation networks. Our investigations are based on real world data for the Portland/Oregon area. We present a microscopic approach for iterative activity assignment: exemplarily for home-to-work trips. It provides a method to generate real-world macroscopic data - in our case it is the travel time distribution resulting from census data - in a network traffic simulation under simulation feedback. The underlying assignment is based on a simple ansatz to split the probability of choosing a workplace in a particular distance into a term which describes the accessibility of workplaces, and the individuals' function of travel time acceptance. In combination with the census data, this approach provides the macroscopic acceptance function, which turns out to be an exponentially decaying function plus a 'repulsive' behavior for small travel times. Furthermore, these investigations demonstrate that iterative activity assignment on a microscopic level is computationally feasible even for realistically sized transportation systems.

The first application of the Cellular Automaton for simulation of traffic flows on streets and highways was introduced by Nagel and Schreckenberg [7]. The basic Cellular Automaton model from Nagel-Schreckenberg has been checked against measurements of realistic traffic flow on urban streets and motorways in Germany. it was found that the measured capacities on German motorways cannot be reproduced very well. On urban streets, however, it was very well possible to represent traffic patterns at intersections. The paper describes a completely new concept for the cellular automaton principle to model highway traffic flow. This model uses a time-oriented car-following model. This model accounts for the real driving behavior more precisely than the model from Nagel and Schreckenberg. This paper shows that a Cellular Automaton is generally applicable for simulation of traffic flows. The degree of correspondence with reality depends on the applied car-following model. The new model concept combines realistic modeling with fast computational performance.

J	Mussa, RN; Upchurch, JE				Mussa, RN; Upchurch, JE			Simulation assessment of incident detection by cellular phone call-in programs	TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						cellular telephones; incident detection; simulation; traffic modeling; wireless communications		This research study was designed to assess by simulation the efficacy of incident detection by cellular phone call-in programs. The assessment was conducted by varying the proportion of drivers with cellular phones on the highway so as to mirror the cellular industry statistics that show a continued growth of ownership of cellular phones in the United States. An analytical model, which combined simulation and the limited field data available in the literature, was used to determine measures of effectiveness of the cellular phone-based detection system. The results showed that a cellular phone detection system offers fast incident detection times and higher detection rates for both shoulder and lane blocking incidents. For example, in moderate traffic flow (i.e. 1,550 vehicles per hour per lane), 90 percent of incidents blocking two lanes were detected in 1.5 minutes when the proportion of drivers with cellular phones was one out of 10 drivers, even with only 20 percent of them willing to report incidents. When the current proportion of cellular ownership, i.e. 1 out of 3, was used in the simulation, the detection time improved to 0.8 minutes. The simulation analysis of incident detection by cellular phones also showed that there is a direct relationship between the probability of detection and the detection time; that is, the specification of a higher detection rate resulted in slower detection times. This is in sharp contrast with the results of field study of automatic incident detection (AID) systems which demonstrated an inverse relationship between probability of detection and detection time.

B	Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL		Ceder, A		Hoogendoorn, SP; Bovy, PHL			Multiclass macroscopic traffic flow modelling: A multilane generalisation using gas-kinetic theory	TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Symposium on transportation and Traffic Theory	JUL 20-23, 1999	JERUSALEM, ISRAEL					In contrast to microscopic traffic flow models, macroscopic models describe traffic in terms of aggregate variables such as traffic density, flow-rate, and velocity. The implied mean traffic behavior depends on the traffic conditions in the direct environment of the vehicles in the traffic stream. Using the analogy between the vehicular flow and flow in fluids encouraged deriving these models (e.g. Lighthill and Whitham (1955), Payne (1979)), The advantages of macroscopic models are among others the insight gained into traffic now operations (e.g. shock-wave analysis), the applicability in model based control, the relatively small number of parameters simplifying model calibration, and the applicability to large traffic networks. Generally, macroscopic models consider the behavior of the aggregate traffic flow. That is, neither a distinction of user-classes, such as traveler types (commuters, freight, recreational, etc.), vehicles types (person-cars, trucks, busses, vans), paying and non-paying traffic, and various types of guided vehicles, nor a distinction of roadway lanes is made. However, we envisage that a generalization of macroscopic traffic flow models to both user-classes and lanes is advantageous. On the one hand, this generalization increases the applicability of macroscopic models to the synthesis and analysis of multilane multiclass (MLMC) traffic flow. As a result, more insight is gained into the response-behavior of the heterogeneous multilane flow, such as effective capacity, velocity distribution, and the distribution of vehicles over the roadway lanes. On the other hand, from the traffic control perspective, contemporary policies pursue a more efficient use of the available infrastructure (e.g dynamic allocation of roadway lanes to classes, class-selective ramp-metering). The heterogeneous multilane network-wide traffic control problem is characterized by multiple objectives (efficiency, safety, etc.), multiple target groups (the user-classes), and a high complexity. The latter is caused by the interaction between the user-classes, the interplay between the available control instruments, and the interaction between the different parts of the network. This complexity requires a model-based approach, demanding the availability of operational models providing deterministic conditional predictions of the multilane heterogeneous traffic now, given some specific control configuration. Only very recently, attempts to generalize the classical macroscopic models emerged. Hoogendoorn (1997), and Hoogendoorn and Bovy (1998a) present a multiclass generalization of the model of Helbing (1996) based on gas-kinetic principles. Research on the multilane generalization of macroscopic flow models is reported by Daganzo (1997), Helbing (1997), and Klar ct al. (1998). Welbing (1997) briefly discusses the multiclass generalization of the gas kinetic multilane equations. In this paper, we present a macroscopic model describing the dynamics of heterogeneous multilane traffic Row, based on gas-kinetic multiclass multilane traffic dynamics. In contrast to the aforementioned models, the MLMC model describes the traffic now by considering the conservative variables density, momentum, and energy, rather than the primitive variables density, velocity, and velocity variance. Using these so-called conservatives simplifies the derivation approach and enables improved mathematical and numerical analysis (cf. Hoogendoorn and Bovy (1998d,1999)). Since the acceleration and lane-changing behavior differs significantly between free-flowing and constrained drivers, the macroscopic flow model considers both driver's states. Other novelties are the derived expressions of the MLMC equilibrium momentum and energy, quantifying the asymmetric user-class and lane interaction. From these expressions, the MLMC equilibrium velocity and velocity variance can be determined. The equilibrium relations result from competitive acceleration and deceleration processes: on the one hand, vehicles accelerate towards their desired velocity, while on the other hand, vehicles that interact with slower vehicles from different user-classes - without being able to immediately overtake to an adjacent lane - decelerate. Also, the equilibrium lane-distribution of the classes as a result of overtaking can be determined. On the input-side, the model allows the specification of the class specific desired velocity, acceleration time, and overtaking probabilities. The paper is organized as follows. First we present the MLMC generalization of the gas-kinetic flow equations of Paveri-Fontana (1975) for constrained and free-Rowing vehicles. Secondly, we present the macroscopic flow model using conservative variables, while subsequently discussing the equilibrium speed-density relations and the density lane distribution. After discussing the numerical solution approach, we present results from application of the macroscopic model to two test cases. Finally, in the closing section we summarize our research findings.

B	Daganzo, CF		Ceder, A		Daganzo, CF			The lagged cell-transmission model	TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY			English	Proceedings Paper	14th International Symposium on transportation and Traffic Theory	JUL 20-23, 1999	JERUSALEM, ISRAEL				HIGHWAY	Cell-transmission models of highway traffic are discrete versions of the simple continuum (kinematic wave) model of traffic flow that are convenient for computer implementation. They are in the Godunov family of finite difference approximation methods for partial differential equations. In a cell-transmission scheme one partitions a highway into small sections (cells) and keeps track of the cell contents (number of vehicles) as time passes. The record is updated at closely spaced instants (clock ticks) by calculating the number of vehicles that cross the boundary separating each pair of adjoining cells during the corresponding clock interval. This average flow is the result of a comparison between the maximum number of vehicles that can be "sent" by the cell directly upstream of the boundary and those that can be "received" by the downstream cell. The sending (receiving) flow is a simple function of the current traffic density in the upstream (downstream) cell. The particular form of the sending and receiving functions depends on the shape of the highway's flow-density relation, the proximity of junctions and on whether the highway has special (e.g., turning) lanes for certain (e.g., exiting) vehicles. Although the discrete and continuum models are equivalent in the limit of vanishingly small cells and clock ricks, the need for practically sized cells and clock intervals generates numerical errors in actual applications. This paper shows that the accuracy of the cell-transmission approach is enhanced if the downstream density that is used to calculate the receiving flow(s) is read l clock intervals earlier than the current time, where l is a non-negative integer that should be chosen by means of a simple formula. The rationale for the introduction of this lag is explained in the paper. The lagged cell-transmission model is related (but not equivalent) to both Godunov's first order method for general flow-density relations and Newell's exact method for concave flow density relations. It is easier to apply and more general than the latter, and more accurate than the former. In fact, if the flow-density relation is triangular and the lag is chosen optimally, then the lagged cell-tansmission model is a conservative, second order, finite difference scheme. As a result, very accurate results can be obtained with relatively large cells. Accuracy formulae and sample illustrations are presented for both the triangular and the general case.

A theory of congested traffic flow which may qualitatively explain these and other diverse effects of self-organization in real traffic flow is discussed.

The basic elements of the model are cells containing a certain fixed number of vehicles. A road section is represented by a chain of these cells which cover the section completely The approach is inspired by hydrodynamics in so far, that the cells move to represent traffic flow whereas the number of vehicles per cell is kept constant. We give some results of the simulation program and compare these to data of an actual test site.

Within this scheme a special feed-back controller is added which uses dynamic reference values. Within the framework of a motorway control system it is shown that this approach allows for modular and subsidiary system architecture. In an example of rerouting control this extended scheme needs neither origin destination (OD) estimations nor traffic forecasts with respect to incertainties of models and parameters in particular the compliance rate. Practical requirements for the algorithms are derived from a test site. The efficiency of this approach is assessed by simulation results utilising a macroscopic traffic flow model and OD estimation from a real motorway topology. Data from loop detectors of the test site are used to bring the simulated scenario close to reality. It is shown that the proposed algorithms are insensitive to estimation errors of the traffic models to be expected when applying the models to reality.

The characterization of the streets includes traffic direction, number of lanes, etc. Once the urban section is outlined, the traffic flow is automatically set up. The models are formally specified, avoiding a high number of errors in the developed application, and the problem solving time is highly reduced. Therefore, a modeler can concentrate in the problem to solve, instead of being in charge of defining a complex simulation system.

A method already applied to analyse flow in motorway is extended to insert also the effects of VMS on traffic flow. The models are worked out by means of using multi-layered feedforward neural networks. The first analyses the density flow relationship and the second the distribution of flow by lane. Input variables are density, total flow, speed, brightness, clearance, meteorological conditions, percentage of heavy vehicles and presence of messages on VMS. Output variables are flows by lane. Speed, flow and density values, necessary to ask the second models, are obtained from the first one. Different scenarios are prepared to ask the model varying percentages of heavy vehicles, meteorological conditions, brightness, clearance and presence of VMS messages. Results show a great influence of VMS on capacity curve but not very significant on lane occupation.

J	Helbing, D; Huberman, BA				Helbing, D; Huberman, BA			Coherent moving states in highway traffic	NATURE			English	Article							PHASE-TRANSITIONS; COOPERATION; SIMULATIONS; EVOLUTION; SYSTEMS; FLOW	Advances in multiagent simulation techniques(1-3) have made possible the study of realistic highway traffic patterns and have allowed theories(3-6) based on driver behaviour to be tested. Such simulations display various empirical features of traffic flows(7), and are used to design traffic controls that maximize the throughput of vehicles on busy highways. In addition to its intrinsic economic values, vehicular traffic is of interest because it may be relevant to social phenomena in which diverse individuals compete with each other under certain constraintsg(9,10). Here we report simulations of heterogeneous traffic which demonstrate that cooperative, coherent states can arise from competitive interactions between vehicles. As the density of vehicles increases, their interactions cause a transition into a highly correlated state in which all vehicles move with approximately the same speed, analogous to the motion of a solid block. This state is safer because it has a reduced lane-changing rate, and the traffic flow is high and stable. The coherent state disappears when the vehicle density exceeds a critical value. We observe the effect also in real Dutch traffic data.

The street network is approximated as a continuum and commuters' movements in the city are measured by the flow intensity, End the local travel cost depends on the location and the traffic flow intensity. We extend the continuum user equilibrium problem to deal with the case of variable demand, in which the traffic demand from any destination in the city to the CBD is assumed to be a function of both the destination location and the total travel cost to the CBD. An equivalent mathematical model is formulated and proved to satisfy the user equilibrium conditions, which is then solved by a finite element solution algorithm.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Modified KdV equation for jamming transition in the continuum models of traffic	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; phase transition; critical phenomenon; modified KdV equation	FLOW MODELS; JAMS; CONGESTION; HIGHWAY	Continuum models of traffic are proposed to describe the jamming transition in traffic flow on a highway. They are the simplified versions of the hydrodynamic model of traffic. Two continuum models are presented: one is described by the partial differential equations and the other is the discrete lattice version. The linear stability theory and the nonlinear analysis are applied to the continuum models. The modified Korteweg-de Vries equation (KdV) near the critical point is derived using the reduction perturbation method. It is shown that the jamming transition and the density wave in the congested traffic flow are described by the modified KdV equation. The solutions of the KdV equations obtained from the two models are compared with that of the optimal velocity model (car following model). (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, a vehicular driving assistant system that is applicable to the mixed environment is proposed. The proposed system uses spread spectrum techniques and consists of several new systems such as a PN code assignment system, new vehicle position systems, and a vehicle map update system. In the proposed system, the wireless broadcast CDMA is used for inter-vehicle communications. This paper also shows preexaminations of the proposed system by using an autonomous traffic flow simulator including inter-vehicle communications. It is shown that the traffic safety can be improved by using inter-vehicle communications.

To enable FRESIM to realistically simulate expressway traffic flow in Singapore, parameters that govern the movement of vehicles needed to be recalibrated for local traffic conditions. This paper presents the application of a genetic algorithm as an optimization method for finding a suitable combination of FRESIM parameter values. The calibration is based on field data collected on weekdays over a 5.8 km segment of the Ayer Rajar Expressway. Independent calibrations have been made for evening peak and midday off-peak traffic. The results show that the genetic algorithm is able to search for two sets of parameter values that enable FRESIM to produce 30-s loop-detector volume and speed (averaged across all lanes) closely matching the field data under two different traffic conditions. The two sets of parameter values are found to produce a consistently good match for data collected in different days.

J	Khan, SI; Ritchie, SG				Khan, SI; Ritchie, SG			Statistical and neural classifiers to detect traffic operational problems on urban arterials	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						surface streets; signalized arterials; incident detection; artificial neural network; operational problems	INCIDENT DETECTION; ARCHITECTURE; NETWORKS	This paper proposes using artificial neural networks in a modular architecture to assist in detecting different types of operational problems on signalized urban arterials. A traffic surveillance infrastructure that includes inductive loop detectors on intersection approaches as well as mid-block system loops for traffic monitoring is used. For arterials, problems that require the attention of a traffic management center operator include lane-blocking incidents, special event conditions, and detector malfunctioning. Problem detection depends on factors such as operating conditions, configuration of sensors within the network, and block or link length. The feasibility of training and testing neural network models as components of a modular architecture, with an appropriate model for each sub-problem of pattern recognition, is demonstrated. The performance of this modular architecture exceeded that of any single architecture applied to the detection of different types of operational problems. The paper also reports on the performance of each type of model considered and the effect traffic flow levels and detector configuration have on the performance of the incident detection model. The results show that with the selection of a suitable architecture, the modular neural classifier outperforms alternative discriminant analysis-based classifiers. This is demonstrated using cyclic data from microscopic simulation and field data from Urban Traffic Control System (UTCS) implementations in the Cities of Los Angeles and Anaheim, California.

J	Mountain, L; Maher, M; Fawaz, B				Mountain, L; Maher, M; Fawaz, B			The influence of trend on estimates of accidents at junctions	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						generalized linear models; highway safety; junction accident risk; trend		While reliable estimates of expected accidents can be achieved by combining observed accidents and accident model predictions using an empirical Bayes approach, there are a number of obstacles to the widespread adoption of the method. This paper concentrates on problems associated with the available predictive models. Of particular concern is the effect on model predictions of accident trends over time resulting from, for instance, traffic growth or national road safety programmes. Since accident models invariably include traffic flow as an explanatory variable, the effects of flow changes can be included provided that account is taken of the nonlinear relationship between accidents and exposure. It is, however, common to assume that accident risk per unit of exposure is constant over time, whereas national data imply that accident risk is declining. In addition, there is a need, in practice, to rank and evaluate remedial sites in terms of the specific accident types or severities which might be targeted by treatment (for example, wet road accidents in the case of surface treatment). This then raises the question of whether the proportions of accidents of various types varies over time or with traffic flow and site characteristics. Generalized linear modelling was used to develop regression estimates of expected junction accidents (both in total and disaggregated by severity, road surface condition and lighting condition) which allow for the possibility of accident risk varying over time. Accident risk at the sample of some 500 junctions was shown to be declining annually by an average of 6%, with no significant difference in the value of trend between accident types. The factors which affected the proportions of accidents of various types included the method of junction control, speed limit and traffic flow. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The purpose is to develop guidelines for designating alternative HOV lanes on existing freeways. simulation results suggest that introducing HOV facilities would significantly improve traffic delays for short and long term steady states, especially during peak hour traffic flow. To ensure the success of the proposed HOV facilities, special attention should be devoted to public awareness and communication, as well as to related planning, education and enforcement issues.

We derive the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation through the modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation from the car following model, using the perturbation method. We find the thermodynamic potential for the jamming transition. It is shown that the coexisting and spinodal lines are obtained, respectively, from the first and second derivatives of the potential. We prove that the jamming transition is the first-order phase transition below the critical point and metastability exists between the coexisting and spinodal lines. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Wang, BH; Wang, L; Hui, PM; Hu, BB				Wang, BH; Wang, L; Hui, PM; Hu, BB			Analytical results for the steady state of traffic flow models with stochastic delay	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; JAMMING TRANSITION; HIGHWAY; CARS	Exact mean field equations are derived analytically to give the fundamental diagrams, i.e., the average speed-car density relations, for the Fukui-Ishibashi one-dimensional traffic flow cellular automaton model of high speed vehicles (v(max)=M>1) with stochastic delay. Starting with the basic equation describing the time evolution of the number of empty sites in front of each car, the concepts of intercar spacings longer and shorter than M are introduced. The probabilities of having long and short spacings on the road are calculated. For high car densities (rho greater than or equal to 1/M), it is shown that intercar spacings longer than M will be shortened as the traffic flow evolves in time, and any initial configurations approach a steady state in which all the intercar spacings are of the short type. Similarly for low car densities (rho less than or equal to 1/M), it can be shown that traffic flow approaches an asymptotic steady state in which all the intercar spacings are longer than M-2. The average traffic speed is then obtained analytically as a function of car density in the asymptotic steady state. The fundamental diagram so obtained is in excellent agreement with simulation data.

In complex systems with highly volatile traffic structures, this matrix is extremely difficult or impossible to assess. Alternatively, especially equipped cars floating with the traffic can act as observers and provide the basis for an empirical model by measuring the state of traffic online. The experience of these probe cars, compared with an idealized, predefined state, signals the emergence of increased traffic densities. By means of empirical laws, the evolution and superposition of these partial flows can be given.

J	Velan, S; Van Aerde, M				Velan, S; Van Aerde, M			The impact of driver and flow variability on capacity estimates of permissive movements	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						gap acceptance; capacity; permissive movements	INTERSECTION	The following paper describes a stochastic extension to earlier research into a generalised deterministic model of driver gap acceptance. This gap acceptance model is applicable to traffic flow at both signalised and unsignalised intersections. The proposed microscopic gap acceptance model has been implemented within the INTEGRATION traffic simulation model and is therefore equally suitable for analysis of a single isolated intersection approach for static conditions, as well as in a fully dynamic analysis of networks consisting of hundreds of signalised and unsignalised intersections. Variability in both the supply of gaps in the priority how and the demand for gaps from the non-priority vehicles is introduced. The analysis illustrates the impact on the overall relationship between priority flow and the capacity of the non-priority Bow. Cowan M3 and exponentially distributed gap supply models are considered, as are normal and lognormal gap-demand models which account for driver heterogeneity. The results are not only shown to be logical, but also consistent with several analytical capacity models, the Highway Capacity Manual and a recent National Cooperative Highway Research Program project on the same topic.

J	Lee, HY; Lee, HW; Kim, D				Lee, HY; Lee, HW; Kim, D			Origin of synchronized traffic flow on highways and its dynamic phase transitions	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							MODEL	We study the traffic flow on a highway with ramps through numerical simulations of a hydrodynamic traffic flow model. It is found that the presence of the external vehicle Aux through ramps generates a new state of "recurring humps"(RH. This novel dynamic state is characterized by temporal oscillations of the vehicle density and velocity which are localized near ramps, and found to be the origin of the synchronized traffic flow reported recently [Kerner and Rehborn. 79, 4030 (1997)]. We also argue that the dynamic phase transitions between the free flow and the RH state can be interpreted as a subcritical Hopf bifurcation.

The dataset is based on a nitrogen dioxide diffusion tube survey for Cambridge where up to 80 roadside and background sites have been monitored continuously over two years, using a two week exposure period Site categories are defined by their function within the urban landscape. Spatial and temporal features of the data set are explained in terms of urban location, street geometry meteorology and traffic behaviour The highest levels of NO2 are found in central canyon streets which are narrow with enclosing architecture and slow-moving traffic. In contrast lower levels are found for the wider, more open radial routes where traffic is free-flowing. The influence of street geometry on NO2 levels for central streets is demonstrated,where canyon sections adjacent to open sections having the same traffic flow record higher concentrations. Whilst all roadside sites are affected by a photochemical pollution 'episode', the greater potential for elevated NO2 concentrations within the canyon sections is significant. The close proximity of low background levels of NO2 to roadside 'hot-spots' is important for public exposure assessment. The variation in background levels across the urban landscape is very small and unrelated to location; whether central, suburban or outer city. Seasonal variation, not seen in roadside data, is clearly apparent in background data with a winter maximum and summer minimum.

An outline is given of the theoretical approach used, followed by a modelling of nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide measurements from sites at Cromwell Road, Central London and Stratford Road, Birmingham Modelled concentrations were compared with observed mixing ratios for both sites. AT Cromwell Road, good agreement was achieved for one month but which was not reproduced as well for the other two months tested. There is uncertainty as to the effect of one of the side streets and whether the general flow is altered during periods of marked solar heating. Also emissions from vehicles may vary from those assumed. The interpretation of the Stratford Road site's results was less straightforward with complications concerning background pollutant levels and changes in emissions from interrupted traffic flow.

The model takes account of traffic densities and composition to estimate pollutant emissions within the model compartment. Meteorological data on wind speed and direction are used to define the exchanges of pollutants between the compartment and the surrounding air. A parameter is also included to describe the exchange in calm conditions. The pollutant concentrations are then estimated from a steady state mass balance equation for the compartment, assuming conservation of pollutants. The model was applied to the prediction of carbon monoxide concentrations in Hope Street, Glasgow. Model parameters were fitted using field measurements, together with concurrent meteorological data and traffic flows estimated from traffic census data for Hope Street. The model accounted well for the observed variations in carbon monoxide. It was found that the model parameters varied seasonally, perhaps due to differences in atmospheric stability which have not so far been included in the model formulation.

J	Ishikawa, T				Ishikawa, T			Development of a road traffic simulator	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						random number; traffic flow; transputer		Traffic jams have been occurring recently on most city street networks. These jams can be avoided by predicting the traffic Bow patterns in advance using computers. The reduction of computer time is very important, especially in the case of real-time prediction of traffic flows. This paper develops a special-purpose simulator for calculating road traffic Bows. The simulator consists of several transputers and a random number generator. Large and complex street networks are partitioned, and each partition is assigned to a transputer for parallel calculations. The stochastic nature of the traffic is taken into account by using random numbers generated by a random number generator. Some traffic Bow patterns are calculated with this simulator. The developed simulator can simulate large and complex street networks using a small amount of computer time.

J	Kaufman, DE; Nonis, J; Smith, RL				Kaufman, DE; Nonis, J; Smith, RL			A mixed integer linear programming model for dynamic route guidance	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; system optimal; dynamic traffic assignment	OPTIMAL TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT	One of the major challenges facing ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems) today is to offer route guidance to vehicular traffic so as to reduce trip time experienced. In a cooperative route guidance system, the problem becomes one of assigning routes to vehicles departing at given times from a set of origins to a set of destinations so as to minimize the average trip time experienced (a so-called system optimal criterion). Since the time to traverse a link will depend upon traffic volume encountered on that link, link times are dynamic. The complex interaction resulting between objective function and constraints makes the dynamic problem significantly more difficult to formulate and solve than the static version. We present a mixed integer linear programming formulation of the problem which is formally derived from a set of traffic flow assumptions. Principal among these is the simplifying assumption that vehicles upon entering a link, assume the speed that traffic would attain were the traffic volume encountered on that link in steady-state. The integer variables correspond to selection of vehicle capacity constraints on the link while the continuous variables correspond to selection of vehicle routes. Implicit within this MILP formulation of the dynamic traffic assignment problem is therefore a decomposition of the problem which results in a conventional capacitated linear programming network flow problem. A small illustrative subnetwork extracted from the city of Sioux Falls is solved to optimality by IBM's OSL Branch-and-Bound algorithm. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Sherali, HD; Ozbay, K; Subramanian, S				Sherali, HD; Ozbay, K; Subramanian, S			The time-dependent shortest pair of disjoint paths problem: Complexity, models, and algorithms	NETWORKS			English	Article						shortest paths; disjoint paths; time-dependent delays; complexity; integer programming		In this paper, we examine complexity issues, models, and algorithms for the problem of finding a shortest pair of disjoint paths between two nodes of a network such that the total travel delay is minimized, given that the individual are delays are time-dependent. Such disjoint paths address the issue of network vulnerability by prescribing alternate routes for traffic flows. Applications include the dispatching of duplicate packets of data to improve the reliability in communication networks and the diverting of traffic during congestion to reduce the chances of bottlenecks in transportation networks, in the presence of time-dependent variations in travel delays in the network. We prove that this problem, and many variations of it, are NP-hard and we develop a 0-1 linear programming model that can be used to solve this problem. This model can accommodate various degrees of disjointedness of the pair of paths, from complete to partial with respect to specific arcs. We also present some computational results obtained by solving the above models using CPLEX-MIP. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Networks 31:259-272, 1998.

The difference equation model is derived from the optimal velocity models formulated in terms of the differential equations. It is compared with the differential equation models. We investigate phase transitions among the freely moving phase, the coexisting phase in which jams appear, and the uniform congested phase. The linear stability theory is applied and the neutral stability line is obtained. We find the critical point below which no jams appear. To derive the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation near the critical point we apply the reductive perturbation method. We also compare the nonlinear analysis result with that of the optimal velocity model. It is shown that the critical point and the amplitude of the jam are different from those of the optimal velocity model.

J	Zhang, XY; Jarrett, DF				Zhang, XY; Jarrett, DF			Chaos in a dynamic model of traffic flows in an origin-destination network	CHAOS			English	Article							STRANGE ATTRACTORS	In this paper we investigate the dynamic behavior of road traffic flows in an area represented by an origin-destination (O-D) network. Probably the most widely used model for estimating the distribution of O-D flows is the gravity model, [J. de D. Ortuzar and L. G. Willumsen, Modelling Transport (Wiley, New York, 1990)] which originated from an analogy with Newton's gravitational law. The conventional gravity model, however, is static. The investigation in this paper is based on a dynamic version of the gravity model proposed by Dendrinos and Sonis by modifying the conventional gravity model [D. S. Dendrinos and M. Sonis, Chaos and Social-Spatial Dynamics (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1990)]. The dynamic model describes the variations of O-D flows over discrete-time periods, such as each day, each week, and so on. It is shown that when the dimension of the system is one or two, the O-D flow pattern either approaches an equilibrium or oscillates. When the dimension is higher, the behavior found in the model includes equilibria, oscillations, periodic doubling, and chaos. Chaotic attractors are characterized by (positive) Liapunov exponents and fractal dimensions. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

Starting from the estimation of the traffic flow, standard parametrized closed-loop regulators for speed signalling and ramp-metering have been tuned using an optimization procedure based on Powell's method. Optimization is carried out by minimizing (or maximizing) an empirical mean cost function according to the Montecarlo paradigm. The regulators perform using an estimate of a macroscopic model-based state vector given by an extended Kalman filter. (C) 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd All rights reserved.

J	Tebaldi, C; West, M				Tebaldi, C; West, M			Bayesian inference on network traffic using link count data	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Markov chain Monte Carlo; network flow data; origin-destination flow	GRAVITY	We study Bayesian models and methods for analysing network traffic counts in problems of inference about the traffic intensity between directed pairs of origins and destinations in networks. This is a class of problems very recently discussed by Vardi in a 1996 JASA article and is of interest in both communication and transportation network studies. The current article develops the theoretical framework of variants of the origin-destination flow problem and introduces Bayesian approaches to analysis and inference. In the first, the so-called fixed routing problem, traffic or messages pass between nodes in a network, with each message originating at a specific source node, and ultimately moving through the network to a predetermined destination node. All nodes are candidate origin and destination points. The framework assumes no travel time complications, considering only the number of messages passing between pairs of nodes in a specified time interval. The route count, or route flow, problem is to infer the set of actual number of messages passed between each directed origin-destination pair in the time interval, based on the observed counts flowing between all directed pairs of adjacent nodes. Based on some development of the theoretical structure of the problem and assumptions about prior distributional forms, we develop posterior distributions for inference on actual origin-destination counts and associated flow rates. This involves iterative simulation methods, or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), that combine Metropolis-Hastings steps within an overall Gibbs sampling framework. We discuss issues of convergence and related practical matters, and illustrate the approach in a network previously studied in Vardi's article. We explore both methodological and applied aspects much further in a concrete problem of a road network in North Carolina, studied in transportation flow assessment contexts by civil engineers. This investigation generates critical insight into limitations of statistical analysis, and particularly of non-Bayesian approaches, due to inherent structural features of the problem. A truly Bayesian approach, imposing partial stochastic constraints through informed prior distributions, offers a way of resolving these problems and is consistent with prevailing trends in updating traffic flow intensities in this field. Following this, we explore a second version of the problem that introduces elements of uncertainty about routes taken by individual messages in terms of Markov selection of outgoing links for messages at any given node. For specified route choice probabilities, we introduce the concept of a super-network-namely, a fixed routing problem in which the stochastic problem may be embedded. This leads to solution of the stochastic version of the problem using the methods developed for the original formulation of the fixed routing problem. This is also illustrated. Finally, we discuss various related issues and model extensions, including inference on stochastic route choice selection probabilities, questions of missing data and partially observed link counts, and relationships with current research on road traffic network problems in which travel times within links are nonnegligible and may be estimated from additional data.

J	Shankar, V; Mannering, F				Shankar, V; Mannering, F			Modeling the endogeneity of lane-mean speeds and lane-speed deviations: A structural equations approach	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						structural equations; three-stage least squares; speed deviation	ACCIDENT	This paper attempts to macroscopically address endogeneity issues related to lane-mean traffic speeds and lane-speed deviations. Methodologically, we seek to provide a better understanding of mean speeds and speed deviations across the lanes of a multilane highway. In so doing, the work may eventually be applied to better understand highway safety and the effects that lane-mean and lane speed deviations have on highway safety. We propose a structural model that relates mean speed and speed deviations by lane and is contemporaneously influenced by environmental, temporal, and traffic flow factors. Spot speed and vehicle classification data measured by lane in both the eastbound and westbound directions of Interstate 90 (I-90) in Washington State are used to develop the empirical relationships. The findings show that lane-mean speeds are endogenously related with adjacent lane speeds and exogenously related with associated environmental, traffic flow and temporal factors, while lane-speed deviations are endogenously related not only with adjacent lane speed deviations but also, through forward causality, lane-mean speeds and exogenously related with environmental, traffic flow and temporal factors as well. The approach shows significant promise in unraveling cause-effect relationships affecting macroscopic traffic flow continuums. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Starting with a microscopic relation for the updating rule describing the occupancy on each site of the road, a macroscopic time-evolution relation is obtained for the average speed of cars by carrying out statistical averages. Mean field equations are obtained as the asymptotic limit of the evolution relation. This gives the average car speed in the long time limit as a function of the car density. The evolution relation can be regarded as a nonlinear mapping between the average speeds at two consecutive time steps. The mean field results are, thus, obtained by studying the attractors of the mapping. The approach is applied to the model recently proposed by Fukui and Ishibashi (FI) for one dimensional traffic flow. The calculation leads to the evaluation of spatial correlation functions involving a string of sites on the road. Our calculations show that for FI models in which the maximum speed of each car is M, a decoupling scheme retaining correlations upto M + 1 sites can be applied to the calculation of spatial correlations involving more than M + 1 sites. Details are given for the cases of M = 1 and M = 2 without and with random delay. Results are reported for the case of M = 3 without random delay. Exact results are obtained using our approach for models without random delay. For models with random delay, results are in good agreement with simulation results. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Nam, DH; Drew, DR				Nam, DH; Drew, DR			Analyzing freeway traffic under congestion: Traffic dynamics approach	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								This paper presents an analysis of freeway traffic flows under congestion based on the principle of traffic dynamics, using the example of recurring congestion. Queuing and discharging mechanisms are analyzed using the fundamental concept of conservation of vehicles. These analysis results are applied for reviewing the two conventional macroscopic analysis tools, deterministic queuing analysis and shock-wave analysis. Comparative study results have demonstrated that (1) the two methods ate fundamentally different from the traffic modeling point of view; (2) deterministic queuing analysis always underestimates the overall magnitude of delays compared to shack-wave analysis; and (3) the area between the demand and the capacity curves in a queuing diagram is analytically equivalent to total vehicle-hours of travel in congestion as opposed to the widely accepted total vehicle-hours of delay. The study results imply that the guidelines of the 1994 Highway Capacity Manual may result in the underestimation of congestion-related statistics. For the purposes of illustration and verification, a numerical example problem is provided.

J	Levinson, DM				Levinson, DM			Speed and delay on signalized arterials	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM	This paper presents a model to predict the influence of traffic flow on the running speed of signalized arterials in Montgomery County, Maryland, while controlling for link length, the number of lanes, and route type. The model separates the changes to link running speed due to same-direction traffic and intersection approach delay from cross-traffic. It is found that flow has a small impact on link speed, each 1,000 v/lh reduces speed by 4-8 k/h. Longer links have higher speeds, indicating that they more closely approximate free-flow conditions. Measures of intersection and link travel times are also compared. Although link running times exceed intersection stopped delay in general, total intersection delay (stopped and approach) exceeds the delay caused by same-direction traffic. This information can inform investment decision makers about roadway and intersection improvements.

Simulations of traffic flow can be used for the analysis and assessment of potential ITS technologies. Using simulations, alternative systems can be tested under identical conditions so the effects of oversaturated conditions, spillback, queuing, and overlap ping bottlenecks can be measured. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) microscopic traffic simulation models, NETSIM, FRESIM, and CORSIM, are regarded as highly comprehensive but somewhat difficult to use. A graphics processor, TRAFVU, has recently been developed for analyzing the output of these microscopic models. TRAFVU was designed to support direct comparison of alternatives to facilitate design and evaluation. Applications of the CORSIM traffic simulation model and the TRAFVU graphics processor to interchange design and developing incident management strategies are presented. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For this method to work, a certain minimum percentage of the drivers must comply with the lane signing. The research described here has been performed to analyze the percentage of drivers that must comply with lane control. A simulation model was developed and tested. The simulation results for heavy traffic flow (1550 vehicles per hour per lane-vphpl), medium traffic flow (900 vphpl), and light traffic flow (300 vphpl) conditions indicate that lane control has little influence on congestion, regardless of the percentage of drivers that comply with the lane control signing; For heavy flow, the congestion level remains high even when all drivers comply. For medium and light flow, the congestion level remains low even when no drivers comply. The region between-heavy and medium traffic flow is, however, sensitive to lane control. Four flow rates between medium and heavy flow were tested. The impact of lane control under these conditions is described. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The two-fluid model, a curvilinear relation between the trip time and stop time per unit distance, has been calibrated to characterize the quality of traffic service in the study network. In addition, relations between the fraction of vehicles stopped and the average concentration, as well as between the averages of speed and concentration, are derived to describe interrupted traffic flow conditions in urban networks.

The network of city roads is assumed to be a square lattice with a decorated site on each bond; a car may locate at a usual lattice site or at a decorated site. We extend a traffic-flow model proposed by Cuesta et al. (Phys. Rev. E 51 (1995) 175) to models on the network of city roads and then study the models by using numerical simulations. We find that there is a phase transition of the first-order type from the free-moving phase to a traffic jammed phase, in general, in Bur models. In the traffic jammed phase, the average velocity of cars is larger for a model in which a traffic signal changes randomly, than for a model in which the traffic signal changes regularly.

J	Wang, BH; Kwong, YR; Hui, PK				Wang, BH; Kwong, YR; Hui, PK			Statistical mechanical approach to Fukui-Ishibashi traffic flow models	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; JAMMING TRANSITION; CARS	We consider cellular automaton models for one-dimensional traffic flow problems. Starting with a microscopic relation for the updating rule describing the occupancy on each site of the road, a macroscopic evolution relation for the average speed of cars can be obtained by carrying out statistical averages. Mean field equations are obtained by considering the asymptotic form of the evolution relation. This gives the average car speed in the long time limit as a function of the car density. The evolution relation is a nonlinear mapping between the average speeds at two consecutive time steps. The mean field results can be obtained by studying the attractors of the mapping. The approach is applied to study the model recently proposed by Fukui and Ishibashi. Our calculations show that for models in which the maximum speed of each car is M, a decoupling scheme retaining correlations up to M+1 sites can be applied to the calculation of spatial correlations involving more than M+1 sites. Exact results are obtained using our approach for models without random delay. For models with random delay, results are in good agreement with simulation results.

Part I: Model description	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						traffic pollution; street canyon; road microenvironments; vehicle wake; multivariate analysis	TURBULENCE; FIELDS	A computer model consisting of wind distribution, emission dispersion, modified Gaussian equation, and stochastic prediction models has been developed to identify street canyon and vehicle wake effects on the transport air pollution from urban road microenvironments. In this work, wind flow and their components in the street canyon are simulated and analyzed considering a two-dimensional street canyon flow pattern. Wind parameters obtained from the analysis are then applied to estimate wind speed and vehicle wake turbulence in microenvironments. Turbulent parameters are integrated in Gaussian equations to estimate pollutant concentrations. A stochastic method has also been considered for predicting maximum concentration in road microenvironments. The model takes traffic data, emission rates, meteorological data, vehicle dimensions, and canyon geometry, and outputs pollutant concentration in microenvironments in an uninterrupted traffic flow section in numerical and graphical form. The model has the predictive capability for CO and NOx. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fuks, H; Boccara, N				Fuks, H; Boccara, N			Generalized deterministic traffic rules	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						cellular automata; traffic models; phase transitions	CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL; FLOW	We study a family of deterministic models for highway traffic flow which generalize cellular automaton rule 184. This family is parameterized by the speed limit m and another parameter k that represents a "degree of aggressiveness" in driving, strictly related to the distance between two consecutive cars. We compare two driving strategies with identical maximum throughput: "conservative" driving with high speed limit and "aggressive" driving with low speed limit. Those two strategies are evaluated in terms of accident probability. We also discuss fundamental diagrams of generalized traffic rules and examine limitations of maximum achievable throughput. Possible modifications of the model are considered.

Drivers can report incidents to a highway agency by voice or by digital messaging either directly or through roadside beacons using a fixed or portable wireless communications system such as a cellular telephone. A FRESIM model was used to simulate shoulder and lane-blocking incidents occurring under variable traffic flow rates. The proportion of drivers with an in-vehicle communication medium arriving upstream of an incident and the degree of the drivers' reporting propensity were introduced as controlled variables. A discrete probability model was used to represent binary reporting decisions of drivers arriving upstream of an incident. The results showed that all incident types that were simulated could be detected in a short time with high probability of detection. The data indicated that all incident types, regardless of the prevailing traffic volume at the time of their occurrence, were detectable in less than one minute if one of five drivers on a freeway had an in-vehicle communication medium and was willing to use it to report the incident. Of special importance is that at the end of 1995 there was one cellular telephone user per five licensed drivers in the United States. The results of the modeling further showed that other factors affecting the detection performance of a driver-initiated incident detection process were the willingness of drivers to report incidents, the length of roadway within which an incident is visible to a driver, and the austerity of the highway agency's procedure for mitigating false reporting.

Via the discrete-event part of the hybrid model, its continuous-time part is adapted according to the variation occurred in the system behaviour. The hybrid modelling methodology proposed is based on the use of a special class of Petri nets, the hybrid stochastic Petri nets (HSPN). These nets are composed of some discrete parts, and some continuous parts, so that a hybrid Petri net can be viewed as a combination of an usual (discrete) Petri net and a continuous Petri net, the 'fluid' version of usual timed Petri nets. The discrete part of the HSPN 'regulates' the continuous PN, which models the functioning of the transportation system. This results in the model reacting to any change to the current system behaviour by adapting the traffic parameters to the new state.

Transportat Res Board				Traffic delays caused by pavement maintenance activities are a major concern to transportation engineers. There is a need to carefully plan and schedule such activities in order to minimize traffic delays. Unfortunately, this is a complex problem that cannot be easily solved by means of conventional optimization tools. A scheduling methodology is presented that uses genetic algorithms (GAs) to minimize traffic delays subject to constraints of maintenance operational requirements. The flexibility in problem modeling and the robust search capability of the GA technique make it a practical analytical tool for this problem. Pavement distress conditions, traffic flow data, and maintenance requirements are the major input parameters of the problem. Based on Singapore's maintenance practice and traffic delay models for four-lane two-way primary roads, a computer program has been developed. This program is applied to solve a hypothetical numerical example problem to illustrate the formulation and solution procedure of the proposed methodology.

The inherent dynamic nature of the traffic flow characteristics is captured using a time-variant Kalman Filtering modeling framework. Changes in drivers' perceptions, as well as other randomness in the route diversion behavior, have been modeled using an adaptive, aggregate, dynamic linear model where the model parameters are updated in real-time using a Bayesian updating approach. The impact of route diversion on freeway O-D demands has been integrated in the estimation framework. The proposed methodology is evaluated using data obtained from a microscopic traffic simulator, INTEGRATION. Experimental results on a freeway incident management system establish that significant improvement in prediction could be achieved by explicitly accounting for route diversion behavior.	12 Technol, Irving, TX 75039 USA	Bhattacharjee, D (corresponding author), 12 Technol, 13th Floor,909 E Las Collinas Blvd, Irving, TX 75039 USA.

For the analysis of pedestrian behavior, 15 streets around an urban railway station in Tokyo were surveyed, and several parameters were obtained, such as pedestrian paths around stationary obstacles; share of pedestrians using the sidewalk as a factor of street environment and traffic conditions; and influence distance of and for bicycles and cars. With respect to planning guidelines, the authors have simultaneously defined a new index of time-space occupancy (Q(r-si)) of traffic modes in mixed-traffic conditions that considers the occupancy of time and space in the time-space diagram. Also, a new concept for level-of-service standards has been suggested for mixed-traffic conditions that employs the concept of time-space occupancy of each mode and hindrance/conflict between modes.

This paper presents an overview of a discrete event simulation model for prediction of traffic speeds and other traffic status information on the inter-urban Indian road network consisting of narrow roads (3.5 m and 5.5 m wide), two lane roads (7 m wide) and multi-lane highways (14 m wide with medians). A conceptual structure of the process oriented simulator has been under development for the past two decades. The simulation model consists of several analytical and empirical submodels representing abstract data structures for the road and driver-vehicle decision processes. The driving strategy adopted by individuals is modified to reflect the changes in vehicle status due to interaction with road geometry and other vehicle interactions. The CLASS data structure in Simula allows the creation of as many instances of the vehicle objects as can be normally found in the traffic stream and thus: pseudo parallelism is mirrored in the simulation model. The model considers up to 20 different vehicle types varying from animal drawn carts to fast moving cars. The road submodel divides a stretch into geometrically homogeneous blocks and computes the median block speed and transformation measure for speed reduction to take into account of the varying geometry from those of ideal conditions for these blocks. Traffic submodel is capable of generating streams with varying vehicle characteristics such as the basic desired speed and power mass ratio. The results of a, few experimental runs have been presented to indicate the efficacy of the models.

Solutions developed to alleviate congestion problems include enhancing system capacity and improvements in the utilization of available capacity (demand management). Intelligent transportation system (ITS) initiatives such as traveler information systems (TIS), travel demand management systems (TDMS), etc. address demand management as one of their objectives. The success of these initiatives rely heavily on the ability to accurately estimate the temporal and spatial distribution of travel demand during peak periods. The focus of this paper is precisely on estimating time dependent origin-destination (O-D) trip tables. Travel demand during peak periods in urban areas is a significant portion of the total daily travel demand. Work trips account for a majority of trips associated during these peak periods. Hence, for illustration purposes only peak period work trips are considered in the analysis. The travel time matrix for the peak period, the O-D trip table for the peak period, and the number of trips expected to arrive into each traffic analysis zone (TAZ) at different work-start times are considered as inputs for the model. The peak study period is divided into several time slices to facilitate simulation and modeling. Time dependent O-D trip tables (in other words, O-D trip tables for each time slice) can now be considered in real-time to evaluate temporal variations of traffic flows on urban transportation networks. Anticipated travel times are estimated in the immediate future. This information along with the optimal paths can be used to influence traffic demand patterns, and hence system performance. The effect of network size and various hardware configurations is considered for demonstrating the model. Computational issues involved with the simulation and modeling process are also discussed.

Transportat Res Board			TRIP DISTRIBUTION; ASSIGNMENT	The approach used in practice to predict short-run transport equilibria involves a sequential process, often with four stages: trip generation, trip distribution, modal split, and traffic assignment. This approach has an inherent weakness-its prediction need not be internally consistent. This deficiency has motivated attempts to predict all four stages simultaneously. The (conventional) sequential and simultaneous models are compared by calibrating and applying both models to the urban transportation network of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The main finding is that the simultaneous model produces better traffic flow predictions than the prediction of the conventional sequential model. These predictions are much better for the heavy volume links that are the most important links in the prediction process.

Transportat Res Board				Several statistics concerning the occurrence of accidents on the most important fraction of the Mexican highway system (basic network) are given. The involvement of cargo trucks in these accidents is discussed. The factors that contribute most to the occurrence of accidents are identified. Among these factors, those related to the speed of the vehicles that make up the traffic flows stand out. An economic analysis to determine the optimum speed limits and highway design speeds is provided. This analysis is based on depicting, for a given road section, the trend of vehicle operating costs (VOCs), accident costs, and the sum of both with respect to speed. The trend of accident costs is determined from assessment of the average cost per accident in the basic network and prediction of the variation of accident rate with respect to mean flow speed. The VOC trend is obtained by using the World Bank VOC model, calibrated for Mexican conditions. Some recommendations for improving existing speed laws and the enforcement of the regulating system are presented. Other actions for generating a national road safety program are mentioned.

Therewith MoTiV is differing from former technology oriented research programms. The participation of nearly the entire German automotive and electronic industry and telematic service providers as well gives the chance for a nation-wide overall concept of new mobility services, in-vehicle assistance and information functions. Two subprojects are defined within the MoTiV programme: mobility in urban areas, which will create the conditions to implement and evaluate mixed transport chains, including an integrated mobility and transport data network, personal travel assistance and simulation models, safe roads, which will deal with the increase of road safety and the improvement of traffic flow, including Turn-off and Lane-changing Assistance, ACC, Vehicle-Vehicle-Communications, Driver Assistance Strategies. MoTiV opens a new prospect for the German automotive and electronic industry playing an important role on the global market in producing innovative products. Systems like ACC, Turn-off and Lane-changing Assistance, Speech-Input Systems and both new telematic service concepts and devices, are offering good chances on the market. Their success depends on a user-friendly, ergonomic design and the costs.									0	0	0	0	1	V D I-V D E - VERLAG GMBH	DUSSELDORF	PO BOX 10 11 39, W-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	0083-5560		3-18-091372-X	VDI BERICHT			1998	1372						181	190					10	Transportation	Transportation	BL10V	WOS:000074278900012					2021-01-11

Whenever in a specific situation travel time on the public line including the time for traffic mode change is less than travel time on the road, a recommendation for changing the transportation means may be given to the driver via invehicle communication or roadside variable message signs. The simulation system contains two parts: a macroscopic traffic flow model for a specified urban road topology and a dynamic model for the trains on a network of transit lines running under a given time table. The efficiency of this model based multi-modal route recommendation system is underlined by an example scenario for a 18 km long corridor in the city of Hamburg where congestion was caused by an incident.									0	0	0	0	1	V D I-V D E - VERLAG GMBH	DUSSELDORF	PO BOX 10 11 39, W-40002 DUSSELDORF, GERMANY	0083-5560		3-18-091372-X	VDI BERICHT			1998	1372						201	215					15	Transportation	Transportation	BL10V	WOS:000074278900014					2021-01-11

Transportat Res Board				The more advanced methods for identifying unsafe intersections and evaluating the safety effect of treatment are based on an Empirical Bayesian framework that requires the use of safety performance functions relating the expected safety of an intersection to characteristics such as traffic flow. Aggregate and disaggregate models were developed to estimate the safety performance of three-legged and four-legged signalized intersections on Ontario provincial roads. Models were disaggregated by time period, accident severity, and environment class. Two levels of models were calibrated for different levels of data availability and model requirements. For Level 1, the safety of an intersection was estimated as a function of the sum of all entering flows; separate estimates were obtained for rear-end, right angle, and turning movement accidents, the three most prominent impact types. In Level 2, specific patterns were defined by the movements of involved vehicles prior to collision, and accidents for the main patterns at four-legged intersections were estimated as a function of flows relevant to each pattern. Aside from the theoretical aspects, the models provide a basis for comparison with available models for other jurisdictions. There are some novel aspects in that, unlike most models available for roads outside municipalities, the ones presented here do allow for safety estimates to be disaggregated by time period, accident severity, impact type, and accident pattern. Moreover, the calibrated models can be used in an Empirical Bayesian framework to estimate the safety of an individual intersection. This is an important feature generally lacking in available models.

This includes the development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) to incorporate modem technology into creating flexible transportation systems which react more efficiently to traffic problems. A particular focus is the creation of an Automated Highway System (AHS) to combine advanced sensing and communication technologies to create highly efficient computer-controlled traffic now. At present, many complex dimensions of automated highway development remain difficult to manage. To develop an evolutionary step toward an automated highway, increasing traffic flow in a highly controlled environment is essential. The Lincoln Tunnel, a Hudson River crossing between New York City and New Jersey: represents a major artery to thousands of commuters living in New Jersey. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ), the governing authority of the Lincoln Tunnel, has dedicated certain priority lanes for bus traffic to streamline traffic flow and create a reward process for mass transit commuters. It is possible to increase flow efficiency using existing technology to control vehicle motion through this corridor. This paper provides a description of physical simulation testing the feasibility of automating lanes for bus now on this roadway.

This is accomplished through the use of the Semantic Control paradigm, implementing a hybrid prediction/routing/control system, to model both macro-level (traffic control) as well as micro level (in-vehicle path planning and steering control). This paper addresses the design and operation of a Kalman filter(1) that processes traffic sensor data in order to model and predict highway traffic volume. This data was given in the form of hourly traffic now, and has been fit using a cubic spline method to allow observations at various time intervals. The filter is augmented via the Method of Sage and Husa(2) to identify the parameters of the system noise on-line, and to determine the dynamics of the traffic process iteratively to aid in the prediction of the future traffic. The results show a good ability to predict traffic flow at the sensors for several time periods in the future, as well as some noise rejection capabilities.

Transportat Res Board			ASSIGNMENT; NETWORKS	Real-time traffic flow management has recently emerged as one of the promising approaches to alleviating congestion. This approach uses real-time and predicted traffic information to develop routing strategies that attempt to optimize the performance of the highway network. A survey of existing approaches to real-time traffic management indicated that they suffer from several limitations. In an attempt to overcome these, the authors developed an architecture for a routing decision support system (DSS) based on two emerging artificial intelligence paradigms: case-based reasoning and stochastic search algorithms. This architecture promises to allow the routing DSS to (a) process information in real time, (b) learn from experience, (c) handle the uncertainty associated with predicting traffic conditions and driver behavior, (d) balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, and (e) deal with missing and incomplete data problems.

It has recently been realized that smaller-diameter particulate pollutants are implicated in the increasing incidence of asthma and cancer. This paper presents the results of a study on particulate pollution from motor vehicles in urban areas. PM10 and other fractions of airborne particulate matters were measured using two aerosol spectrometers in an urban street canyon in Nottingham, UK. Detailed information on traffic flow and vehicles was collected using video recording and sample surveys. Variations in temporal, spatial and size distributions of PM10 and inhalable, thoracic and alveolic fractions of particulates are presented. This study will be of benefit to researchers in the field of atmospheric dispersion modelling and to epidemiologists looking at the health effects of particulate pollution.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF VEHICLE DESIGN			English	Article						air quality modelling; vehicle-related emissions; VOCs speciation		A numerical model named AZUR has been developed by IFP-EDF-LISA to simulate regional episodes of photochemical pollution. This model requires data on pollutant emissions defined at space and time scales corresponding to one square kilometre and one hour. In addition to the amount of emitted pollutants, the knowledge of their chemical composition is of prime interest for correctly representing air chemistry through detailed modules such as MOCA. It is therefore important to know the emitter type in order to assign an appropriate chemical composition to various pollutant flows. IFP has developed a set of methods whose aim is to determine an inventory of traffic-related pollutants (CO, SO2, particles, VOCs and NOx). They are based on the knowledge of the vehicle density and average traffic flow at the site of each measurement point. Density and speed data were converted into pollutant flows using emission factors (in grams of pollution per km travelled) as functions of speed. The emission factors are specific to each vehicle category. Separate counts for each category enabled us to assign, as previously mentioned, a specific chemical composition (in particular for VOCs) to emissions in each category. But very few data are available regarding the VOC emission speciation as a function of different vehicle types. Moreover, these data are very often associated with a specific driving cycle, which does not necessarily correspond to cycles used for determining emission factors. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the impact of these uncertainties in VOC speciation. Air quality in the Paris area will be simulated using the AZUR model with various VOC distributions. These distributions, taken from the literature, are either measurements carried out using specific driving cycles or overall values. Ozone profiles will be analysed and compared in both urban and rural areas to assess the sensitivity of results to the VOC distribution related to road traffic.

It is a simple method using available data (inhabitants and jobs) as input. The model can be used by local councils in traffic and environmental planning. The development of the model is based on data of Copenhagen. The total traffic flow distributed over different vehicle categories and speeds has been registered together with number of inhabitants and jobs. Total emission of NOx, CO, HC, particles, CO2 and energy consumption has been calculated using a detailed emission model. The correlation between urban data, traffic now and emissions has been analysed using statistical methods testing different hypotheses. It was concluded that there exists a linear correlation between urban data and emissions; Based on this, the Urban Emission Model has been developed.

Transportat Res Board			NETWORKS; SYSTEMS	The dynamic traffic control problem and the dynamic traffic assignment problem are integrated as a noncooperative game between a traffic authority and highway users. The objective of the combined control-assignment problem is to find a mutually consistent dynamic system-optimal signal setting and dynamic user-optimal traffic flow. The combined control-assignment problem is first formulated as a one-level Cournot game: the traffic authority and the users choose their strategies simultaneously. The combined control-assignment problem is subsequently formulated as a bi-level Stackelberg game. The traffic authority is the leader; it determines the signal settings in anticipation of the users' reactions. The users are followers who choose their routes after the signal settings have been determined. Finally, the system-optimal control-assignment problem is formulated as a Monopoly game. The sole player-the traffic authority-determines both signal settings and traffic flows to achieve a dynamic system-optimal solution. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the equilibria of the games.

Transportat Res Board				Of late, there has been a considerable volume of empirical research on freeway operations during periods of high flow. Part of the motivation for this realm of research is the attractive possibility of increasing flow and speed by preventing breakdown in congested operations. This possibility has been fueled by observations of a "capacity drop," wherein the discharge flow from the resulting queue is smaller than those observed before breakdown. The research on which this paper is based was aimed at exploring in more detail the implications of metering traffic flow at levels below that at which a breakdown occurs. From this perspective, the nature of precongestion flows is investigated empirically to determine the potential gains from such a policy. The most important contribution is an examination of the likelihood of success of such metering by establishing the probability of breakdown at various traffic flow levels. It is shown, for example, that 1-min median lane flows that are 20 percent larger than queue discharge flows have only a 10 percent probability of breakdown and that 1-min flows equal to the mean queue discharge flows have a negligible probability of breakdown. These results not only have practical significance but also are useful for improving the efficiency of freeway simulation models.

In the upper level problem, the signal timing plan for coordinated fixed time control has been defined. In the lower level problem, user equilibrium traffic assignment obeying Wardrop's first principle has been formulated as a variational inequality problem. Mathematical expressions for various components of the performance index in the upper level problem and the average delay in the Power level problem have been derived and reported (Chiou 1997a). A mixed search procedure has been proposed as the solution method to the bi-level problem and a range of numerical tests have been carried out (Chiou 1997b, 1998a,b). In this paper, further numerical tests are performed on Allsop and Charlesworth's (1977) road network in which various traffic loads are taken into account. Effectiveness in terms of the robustness and reliability of the mixed search procedure in congested and uncongested road networks is thus investigated further. Comparisons of the performance index resulting from the mixed search procedure and that of mutually consistent TRANSYT- optimal signal settings and traffic flows are made for the congested road network.

Environmental and safety considerations will usually entail some streets being reserved for pedestrians only and others for access to car parks and service bays close to the pedestrian precinct. The effect of the new topology on traffic flow can and should be an input to the planning process. One way to appraise alternative: schemes is to find the extent to which traffic could be routed to reduce the amount of conflict there will be between the different streams of traffic at the junctions; conflict at junctions is a simple measure indicating the potential for both accidents and congestion with its attendant pollution. The problem of finding an assignment of flow such that conflict is minimised is a constrained optimisation problem. The main constraints are provision of routes for a demand specified by an origin-destination (OD) matrix. The objective function which measures the amount of conflict between the different streams is simple to formulate; it depends only on the topology of the network and the OD matrix of demand. But it is a quadratic function of a type which is not amenable to existing programming methods. However, the author has developed an iterative method for obtaining good, if not necessarily optimal, solutions. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate the appraisal of hypothetical networks involving four external zones. The OD matrix has been chosen tal model some through as well as mostly inbound traffic flow. Various alternative schemes are appraised ranging from those which merely allow one access point to a car park within a ring of streets surrounding the pedestrian precinct, to those which retain one link across the ring and up to two car parks. This is a pilot study for a larger one involving the systematic analysis of hypothetical town centre topologies. So far it has shown the advantage of two access points over one, and the greater advantage of two separate car parks each with a single access point which allows each car park to be in a separate cell of the road network.

We analyze a control architecture to improve surface street flow using adaptive signal controllers and introduce an important component towards coordinating control of surface street networks with freeway control. The contribution of this paper relates to the use of a particular adaptive signal control scheme at each intersection called ALLONS-D and a description of how to impart directives from a higher level controller to these local controllers such that traffic performance on the whole is maximized. Our result is a multi-layer approach for controlling the infrastructure in an urban street network. Simulations on an arterial network and a grid network are performed to test the coordination procedure that is presented.

This progress was achieved using the concept of minimal microscopic models, which are intended to reproduce only the essentials of traffic flow, but by still simulating single cars with individual routes. Taking into account dynamical changes of traffic demand is very important in applications such as telematics, intelligent transport systems or online routing and requires a microscopic approach with individual cars having their own routes. In this contribution we present work concerned with the dynamic assignment problem and with the realtime simulation of large road networks. Both approaches can be parallelized and are therefore suitable for parallel computers. Currently, large road networks with up to 10(6) travellers can be simulated in real-time on a 8-processor SUN Enterprise.

In this paper, a novel hybrid model for transportation systems is proposed, in which the functioning is represented via a continuous-time model whenever no changes in the traffic flow occur, whereas the changes in the system behaviour are modelled through a discrete event system coupled with the continuous-time system, on which acts as a regulator. The hybrid modelling methodology proposed is based on the use of a special class of Petri nets, the Hybrid Stochastic Petri Nets (HSPN). These nets are composed of some discrete parts, and some continuous parts, so that a hybrid Petri net can be viewed as a combination of an usual (discrete) Petri net and a continuous Petri net, the 'fluid' version of usual timed Petri nets. The discrete part of the HSPN 'regulates' the continuous PN, which models the functioning of the transportation system, making the continuous-time part adapt according to the variation occurred in the system behaviour. As a result, the model reacts to any change in the current system behaviour by adapting the traffic parameters to the new state.

The two main problems in a freeway construction work zone are - "congestion," and "safety". Currently, signs that are posted along the freeway display messages such as "Construction Ahead - Expect Delay," or "Possible Delay Ahead". Such messages do not provide specific and reliable information, and more often than not, they end up being ignored by motorists. The Travel Time Prediction System (TIPS) is a portable system that predicts travel time from any one point to another on a freeway work zone, on a real-time basis, and displays the estimated travel time to motorists via the use of Variable Message Signs (VMS's) posted along the freeway, TIPS Is a comprehensive, automated system intended for use on rural freeway work zones, and has been designed to operate with minimal human supervision. It collects realtime traffic flow data at 30-second intervals using non-contact sensors; communicates the data to an on-site personal computer which processes them to obtain estimated travel time; and transmits the travel time information to VMS's positioned at pre-determined locations along the freeway. The system was tested and validated for a short work zone in October 1997. Further field-testing and validation is required for long work zones and for work zones involving crossovers.

Most of the traffic assignment methodologies, that have been utilized to date to examine such networks, however, either have been predominately static in nature or have only approximated the full dynamics that are present in these networks. In contrast, some of the traffic simulation models that have attempted to better capture some of these operational dynamics have needed to ignore some finer elements of the routing aspects of the problem. This research presents and demonstrates a new solution approach to the dynamic traffic assignment problem, called DYNAMIC. This new model performs a macroscopic network equilibrium analysis, similar to most traditional transportation planning oriented network equilibrium methods, but is responsive to operational network dynamics in a fashion that has traditionally only been observed in traffic engineering oriented simulation models. The model solves the dynamic traffic assignment problem using tri-level modules. In the first level, new alternative minimum routes to traverse the network are found. At the second level, the proportion of vehicles that should utilize these alternative routes is solved. At the third level, the routes that vehicles utilize and the proportions in which vehicles utilize these routes are held constant, and a convergent solution between the resulting link travel times and the associated arrival logs at subsequent links is solved.

Often (e.g. if the data is an input to an incident detection or traffic management system) it will be necessary or desirable to replace the missing data with suitable estimates. Moreover, where a modelling process is involved as part of the system, the additional issue arises of how the prediction performance of the model has been affected by the missing data. Within a statistical context for example, time series modelling techniques which rely on the autocorrelation structure in the data for model identification and parameterisation will clearly be affected where gaps in the data occur. The effects on other types of model, including Neural Network type structures also raise considerable concerns and remain largely undetermined. The problems addressed here, therefore, are which basic techniques can be reliably used for the replacement of missing data and perhaps more importantly, how model prediction performance is affected when missing data occurs. In order to investigate this, data sets containing different percentages of missing data, (10%, 20% and 30%) working at the one-minute level, were generated within a data file. For each level of missing data, three different replacement techniques were then used to infill the gaps. Further investigations were carried out using additional test files, both with and without missing data, and also using validation files. In order to provide a comparison with the NNs ARIMA statistical models were subsequently developed in order to highlight the manner in which different model types were affected.

A new model of pedestrian delay at a random point downstream of a signalized intersection in an urban area is formulated for vehicular traffic flow that has both bunched and random components. Traffic observations were taken at two sites on urban arterial roads in Sydney where pedestrian delay was measured. The pedestrian delay obtained from the model is compared with field measurements and with results of a simulation model. The influence of saturation flow and distance away from the signalized intersection on pedestrian delay is explored using the model and simulation results.

Transportat Res Board				A linear acceleration car-following model has been developed for realistic simulation of traffic flow in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. The new model provides continuous acceleration profiles instead of the stepwise profiles that are currently used. The brake reaction times of the drivers are simulated effectively and are independent of the simulation time steps. Chain-reaction times of the drivers are also simulated and perception thresholds are incorporated in the model. The preferred time headways are utilized to determine the simulated drivers' separation during car-following. The features of the model and the realistic vehicle simulation in car-following and in stop-and-go conditions make this model suitable to ITS, especially to autonomous intelligent cruise-control systems. The car-following algorithm is validated at microscopic and macroscopic levels by using field data. Simulated versus field trajectories and statistical tests show very strong agreement between simulation results and field data.

Transportat Res Board				In traffic how analysis several regimes are distinguished, such as congested and noncongested flow conditions. Indications exist that driving behavior differs by regime and that it may change discontinuously between regimes. In contrast most traffic flow models used today basically assume the same car-following behavior irrespective of the traffic flow regime. It is hypothesized that, because of this deficiency, these models do not always perform satisfactorily. To clarify this issue, differences in car following between congested and noncongested flow are analyzed with data from two sites on Dutch freeways. It is shown that, at the same speeds, passenger car drivers follow with smaller headways in noncongested than in congested flow. Car-following of truck drivers does not show differences between regimes. Microscopic distance gap-speed models are established for several road-user classes, valid for each of the two flow regimes. To show the improvements resulting from these new microscopic relationships, the latter are implemented in a microscopic simulation model with which macroscopic patterns in traffic flow are modeled. The macroscopic findings produced with the regime-specific car-following rules show a considerable improvement in modeling performance.

Transportat Res Board			HYPERBOLIC CONSERVATION-LAWS; CONGESTED FREEWAYS; DYNAMICS	An improved high-order continuum model is developed based on hyperbolic conservation laws with relaxation, linearized stability analysis, and more realistic considerations of traffic flow. The improved high-order model allows smooth traveling wave solutions as well as contact shocks (different densities moving at the same speed), is able to describe the amplification of small disturbances on heavy traffic, and allows fluctuations of speed around the equilibrium values. Furthermore, unlike existing high-order models, it does not result in negative speeds at the tail of congested regions and disturbance propagation speeds greater than the traffic flow velocity because the improved model has a zero characteristic speed and a nonnegative characteristic speed that is equal to the traffic flow velocity. The relaxation time is a function of density and, in the equilibrium limit, the improved high-order model is consistent with the simple continuum model. The improved high-order model is compared with the simple continuum model. Exemplary test results suggest that the improved high-order model is intuitively correct. Comparison of numerical results with field data suggests that the improved high-order model yields lower error levels than the simple continuum model.

Transportat Res Board			FLOW	In contemporary traffic flow theory, the distinction between user classes is rarely made. However, we envisage that the accuracy and the descriptive power of the macroscopic traffic how models can be improved significantly by separating user classes and their specific flow characteristics. As a consequence, the possibility of improved estimation and prediction of traffic flow conditions becomes available. Additionally, the availability of a realistic multiple user-class traffic flow model enables the automated generation of user-dedicated traffic control policies by means of mathematical optimal control theory. A macroscopic multiple user-class model is derived from mesoscopic principles. In opposition to earlier multiple user-class models, the model presented here implicitly defines equilibrium relationships between traffic density and equilibrium velocities as a function of current traffic conditions, traffic composition, and distribution of user-class-dependent desired velocities. Additionally, the velocity variance variable is introduced describing deviations from the average speed within the user classes. The multiple user-class model identifies competing processes. On the one hand, drivers attempt to traverse the freeway at their desired velocity; on the other hand, they adjust their velocity because of interaction with slower vehicles. These processes can result in self-formation of apparently random local structures. Finally, the proposed model satisfies the anisotropy condition and the invariant personality condition.

Transportat Res Board				The purpose of this paper is to explore various traffic modeling aspects and theories that may overcome some of the limitations in existing microscopic simulation models. A multiregime microscopic traffic simulation approach has been formulated featuring realistic and comprehensive car-following and lane-changing logic. A prototype implementation of the multiregime approach was developed in C++ and extensively tested. The multiregime simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and validity of the proposed models for a broad range of traffic scenarios. The rest and validation results indicate that the model and program outperformed traditional methods and other existing traffic simulation programs. The validity and efficiency of the model is attributed to the fact that the regimes were added to the model incrementally to reflect increasing agreement with real-world traffic flow. The techniques and corresponding models will be used to improve existing microscopic traffic simulation models and programs.

Transportat Res Board			TIME-SERIES	The application of seasonal time series models to the single-interval traffic flow forecasting problem for urban freeways is addressed. Seasonal time series approaches have not been used in previous forecasting research. However, time series of traffic flow data are characterized by definite periodic cycles. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and Winters exponential smoothing models were developed and tested on data sets belonging to two sites: Telegraph Road and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge on the inner and outer loops of the Capital Beltway in northern Virginia. Data were 15-min flow rates and were the same as used in prior forecasting research by B. Smith. Direct comparisons with the Smith report findings were made and it was found that ARIMA (2, 0, 1)(0, 1, 1)(96) and ARIMA (1, 0, 1)(0, 1, 1)(96) were the best-fit models for the Telegraph Road and Wilson Bridge sites, respectively. Best-fit Winters exponential smoothing models were also developed for each site. The single-step forecasting results indicate that seasonal ARIMA models outperform the nearest-neighbor, neural network, and historical average models as reported by Smith.

B	Boyce, DE; Ran, B; Li, IY		Bell, MGH		Boyce, DE; Ran, B; Li, IY			Considering travelers' risk-taking behavior in dynamic traffic assignment	TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS: RECENT METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES			English	Proceedings Paper	4th EURO Transportation Meeting on Transportation Networks	SEP 09-11, 1996	UNIV NEWCASTLE, NEWCASTLE, AUSTRALIA	Assoc European Operat Res Soc	UNIV NEWCASTLE		EQUILIBRIUM; NETWORKS	Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been a topic of substantial research during the past decade and the DTA models offer the potential to support effective evaluation and operation Advanced Transportation Management System (ATMS) and Advanced Transportation Information System (ATIS). But still, many aspects of DTA need improvement, especially its behavior assumptions. In a realistic setting, one might expect that network travel times at each time for given traffic flows are stochastic in nature. The model presented in this paper is a stochastic dynamic user optimal model based on a stochastic dynamic network. The assumption is that route travel times are variable and perceived as such by travelers at each time instant. Route choices are assumed to be made with the objective of minimizing perceived disutilities at each time, These perceived disutilities depend on the distribution of the variable route travel times, the distribution of individual perception errors and the individual traveler's risk taking nature at each time. The route choice criterion in this model is the traveler's perceived disutility. The form of the disutility function is dependent on the behavioral assumptions made about the traveler. The assumptions about the behavioral nature of travelers are that they are either risk averse, risk prone or risk neutral. Three different disutility functions for risk averse, risk prone and risk neutral behavior types will be used in this study. The risk-taking behavior will be integrated into the model through a Variational Inequality approach. Subsequently, we will discuss a solution algorithm for the VI. This algorithm uses a combination of various solution techniques, such as relaxation and Method of Successive Averages(MSA). It will be applied to several scenarios to verify the correctiveness of the solutions obtained and demonstrate the property of risk-taking behavior model in the context of dynamic route choice.

Both models were suggested by Dendrinos and Sonis (1990) as modifications of, respectively, the conventional static gravity model (Ortuzar and Willumsen, 1990) and the legit-based trip assignment model (Dial, 1971), but without giving any detailed analysis. The two models are considered as discrete-time dynamical systems. They describe the variations of traffic flows in an Origin-Destination (O-D) network or a road network at discrete time periods. In this paper, the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the equilibrium in the two traffic models will be analysed by the methods in nonlinear dynamics. The notions of User Equilibrium (UE) and Stochastic User Equilibrium (SUE) that have been used in trip assignment models will be introduced to the dynamic gravity model to describe the equilibrium in an O-D network. It will be shown that the equilibrium in the dynamic gravity model with the power or exponential deterrence function, and in the dynamic assignment model is unique. However, the equilibrium in the dynamic gravity model with the combined deterrence function is not necessarily unique; multiple equilibria, periodic orbits, and chaos will be shown to exist in the model.

It describes a two-way traffic flow with cars moving in opposite directions. The interchannel interaction makes cars slow down in the vicinity of approaching cars in the other lane. Particularly, we consider in detail the system with a finite density of cars on one lane and a single car on the other. When the interchannel interaction reaches a critical value, a traffic jam occurs, which turns out to be of first-order phase transition. We derive exact expressions for the average velocities, the current, the density profile and the k-point density correlation functions. We also obtain the exact probability of two cars being in one lane of distance R apart, provided there is a finite density of cars on the other lane, and show that the two cars form a weakly bound state in the jammed phase.

The proposed methodologies provide a convenient means for evaluating signal control strategies at the operation level of advanced traffic management systems as well as for generating simulation-based forecasting information for advanced traveler information systems. To do this we have employed the System Entity Structure/Model Base framework, which is a hierarchical and modular discrete-event modeling and simulation environment. We have also adopted a symbolic simulation that can generate all possible combinations of signal cycles and traffic dependency. Traffic flow analysis methodologies applied to arterial traffic systems and highway traffic systems are described. Several simulation tests demonstrate the techniques.

J	Howe, LD				Howe, LD			Studies of traffic flow phenomena using the VEDENS computer code	PHYSICA A			English	Article						traffic; highway; simulation; modelling		The VEDENS computer code models traffic flows on unidirectional, multilane highways, including on-and off-ramps. The logic behind the code is explained, including driver decision making. Calculations have been carried out for from 1- to 6-lane flow. The fundamental flow diagram has been plotted for all lane configurations and calculations of saturation behaviour have been made for on-ramp and off-ramp flows and short-term, total blockages. It is concluded that the efficiency of a highway decreases significantly when the number of lanes is increased to more than four. Increasing the number of lanes is beneficial fur on-ramp flows, but increasing the number to more than three has no effect on the maximum capacity when 20% or more of the vehicles desire to exit via a given off-ramp. When the highway becomes totally blocked for a short time, the evolution of the node of stationary traffic can be predicted.

Therefore, modern vehicle research is focused on improving driving comfort as well as passengers' safety. Aiming at that, recent advances in control engineering and modern computer technology enable the engineer to design special control and supervision systems to support the driver. As an example, this contribution presents two possible solutions. An Adaptive Cruise Control system assists the driver in highway traffic, whereas a vehicle-supervision method is applied to detect critical driving situations and sensor faults.

J	Liu, GQ; Lyrintzis, AS; Michalopoulos, PG				Liu, GQ; Lyrintzis, AS; Michalopoulos, PG			Numerical simulation of freeway traffic flow	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							CONGESTED FREEWAYS; DYNAMICS	A new high-order continuum model is presented in this paper. This high-order model exhibits smooth solutions rather than discontinuities, is able to describe the amplification of small disturbances on heavy traffic, and allows fluctuations of speed around the equilibrium values. Furthermore, unlike some earlier high-order models, it does not result in negative speeds at the tail of congested regions and disturbance propagation speeds greater than the flow speed. The model takes into account the relaxation time as a function of density and, in the equilibrium limit, it is consistent with the simple continuum model. A Riemann-problem-based numerical method is proposed for the solution of the new high-order model. Modelling of interrupted how behavior such as merging, diverging, and weaving is also investigated. Based on the new high order model, the proposed numerical method and the modelling of interrupted flow, a versatile code is developed for the numerical simulation of freeway traffic flow that includes several freeway geometries. We compare the high-order model with the simple continuum model and the proposed numerical method with the Lax method based on 30-s and 5-min field data. The model is tested in interrupted flow situations (e.g., pipeline, merging, diverging, and weaving areas). A comparison of numerical results with limited field data shows that the high-order model performs better than the simple continuum model and describes better than a previously proposed method.

J	Zhang, XY; Jarrett, DF				Zhang, XY; Jarrett, DF			Stability analysis of the classical car-following model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						traffic flow; car-following model; nonlinear dynamical system; stability analysis		This paper investigates the stability of the classical car-following model (for example, Chandler et al., Operations Research, 6, 165-184, 1958; Herman et al., Operations Research, 7, 86-106, 1959; Wilhelm and Schmidt, Transportation Engineering Journal (ASCE) 99, 923-933, 1973). Conditions for local and asymptotic stability as defined in the references cited are established for the linear model. These differ from those in the literature in two ways. First, it will be shown that, in the autonomous model when the product of the coefficient of proportionality cu and the reaction time tau is less than or equal to 1/e, there exist oscillatory solutions with higher frequencies than 2 pi, although there are none with lower frequencies. Secondly, asymptotic stability is considered along with local stability. The derived condition for asymptotic stability is both necessary and sufficient. In addition, the condition depends on the frequency of the forcing term, with the sufficient condition alpha tau < 1/2 for the asymptotic stability found in the literature being included as a special case. The nonlinear model is considered by linearization and numerical integrations. Some practical values of parameters are tested for the stability of the model. The analyses in this paper are extended to consider different values of alpha and tau for different drivers in the line. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Holland, EN; Woods, AW				Holland, EN; Woods, AW			A continuum model for the dispersion of traffic on two-lane roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						two-lane flow; continuum models; dispersion		A continuum model for two-lane traffic flow is developed using the theory of kinematic waves in which the wavespeeds in the two lanes are assumed constant but unequal. The transient behaviour is found exactly using Riemann's method of characteristics and an asymptotic model of the long time Row is described. It is shown, that for large times, the traffic concentration moves with a weighted mean wavespeed of the two lanes and disperses about this mean speed as a result of interlane concentration differences generated by the relative wavespeeds. The dispersion can be described by a virtual coefficient of diffusion proportional to the square of the differences of the two wavespeeds and inversely proportional to the rate of lane changing. The technique is extended to describe three-lane traffic flow and to include the dependence of wavespeed upon concentration. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Congestion aspects of traffic flow are represented by introducing state dependent service rates as a function of number of vehicles on each road link.

Finally, queueing models to analytically determine the optimal capacity and performance measures of the road links are incorporated into a series of software programs available from the authors.

J	Esser, J; Schreckenberg, M				Esser, J; Schreckenberg, M			Microscopic simulation of urban traffic based on cellular automata	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						traffic; cellular automata; complex systems	MODEL	Saturated capacities in traffic systems evoke increasing interest in simulations of complex networks serving as laboratory environment for developing management strategies. Especially for urban areas questions concerning overall traffic control have to be considered with regard to their impacts on the whole network. Modeling traffic flow dynamics using cellular automata allows us to run large network traffic simulations with only comparatively low computational efforts. We present a traffic simulation tool for urban road networks which is based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg Model. Arbitrary kinds of roads and crossings are modeled as combinations of only a few basic elements. Furthermore parking capacities are considered as well as circulations of public transports. The vehicles are driven corresponding to route plans or at random depending on the available data. The application of this network simulation covers investigations on the held of traffic planning as well as online simulations based on real-time traffic data as basis for dynamic traffic management systems.

J	Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Konhauser, P				Kerner, BS; Klenov, SL; Konhauser, P			Asymptotic theory of traffic jams	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							FLOW; MODEL; CONGESTION	Based on singular perturbation methods, an asymptotic theory of traffic jams of large amplitude is developed. Simple equations describing the form of traffic jams of large amplitude are found. The theory leads to analytical formulas for the characteristic, i.e., intrinsic or unique, parameters of traffic flow (such as the average velocity of the downstream front of a wide jam, as well as the flux, density and average vehicle speed of the outflow from the jam) which are independent of the road length, the vehicle density of the initial traffic flow, or other initial conditions. Analytical investigations have been made that show that, in agreement with earlier numerical results [B. S. Kerner and P. Konhauser, Phys. Rev. E 50, 54 (1994)], the boundary (threshold) flux at which a traffic jam can still exist is equal to the flux in the outflow from a jam. The manner in which the shape of a traffic jam evolves due to changes in the initial vehicle density is analytically investigated. Simple analytical formulas are obtained for the parameters of narrow traffic jams capable of forming in a limited interval of vehicle densities. A comparison is also made between the results of the present analytical theory of traffic jams, the theory of shock waves in gas dynamics, the classical Lighthill-Whitham-theory [M. J. Lighthill and B. G. Whitham, Proc. R. Sec. London Ser.

J	Gavrilov, KL				Gavrilov, KL			Microstructure and microdynamics of uninterrupted traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							KINETICS	In this paper, ''uninterrupted homogeneous traffic flow'' is viewed as a dynamic system of spontaneously aggregating and breaking clusters of cars. This approach gives qualitative and quantitative descriptions of density fluctuations and dynamics of free traffic flow in terms of car clusters, and their distributions with respect to the number of cars in a cluster. The distributions have a nontrivial shape and a nonlinear dependence on the density of cars on the expressway. Their shape and evolution as a function of car density are described adequately by a model proposed here. This one-parameter model based on a modified Smoluchowski equation predicts a critical density at which a phase transition occurs from free to synchronized traffic how for a multilane expressway: rho(cr)=16+/-3 vehicles km(-1) (lane)(-1), and that below this critical density traffic flow can be treated as a one-dimensional system. The model may also find application in the study of the low density pneumatic transport of granular and powdered materials.

The aim of this study was to examine decentralization policies to be implemented in Istanbul and to consider the impact of the multicore urban model on urban transportation. In the first section of this paper, areas in Istanbul with potential for further development are determined using the dynamic Lowry model. In the second section, scenarios regarding the decentralization of industry are generated based on the results obtained from the first. In the third section, the traffic-flow results of the current situation and scenarios over the current transportation system are obtained. The conclusion reached is that the decentralization of industry in Istanbul and transforming the city into a linear and multicore structure do have positive impacts on various aspects of the urban transportation system.

J	Mahnke, R; Pieret, N				Mahnke, R; Pieret, N			Stochastic master-equation approach to aggregation in freeway traffic	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; DYNAMICAL MODEL; FLOW	In analogy to the usual aggregation phenomena, such as the formation of liquid droplets in a supersaturated vapor, the nucleation, growth, and condensation of car clusters are considered in a one-lane freeway traffic flow model. The clustering behavior (known as congestion) in an initially homogeneous traffic stream is described by a master equation. The construction of the stochastic equation is given as well as its relationship to other dynamical models. Numerical experiments in heavy traffic with well-explained transition probabilities show the transition from the initial free particle situation (free jet of vehicles) to the final congested cluster state, where one big aggregate of cars is formed. The results are presented analytically in dependence of the stable cluster size from car concentration and numerically as stochastic trajectories.

The floor-attribute-based control method uses a combination of floor-attribute-based evaluation and car-attribute-based evaluation. Computer simulations show it can improve multiple preferential floor settings at the same time. Additionally, an on-line parameter tuning method using genetic algorithms is proposed. The floor attribute control method needs several dozen control parameters to be tuned according to each building's traffic, and the proposed method can do it. The elitist-preserving strategy is an effective way to keep control stability. A diversity-recovering operation, which initializes population, excluding the elitist individual, when traffic flow data have changed, improves the following ability for transitions of utilized conditions.

Queuing effects are explicitly taken into account in an overall manner. The resulting model is a generalization of Paveri-Fontana's Boltzmann-like traffic model and allows the derivation of macroscopic traffic equations for interacting lanes, including velocity equations. The related effective macroscopic traffic model for the total freeway cross-section is also derived. It provides corrections with respect to previous traffic models, but agrees with them in special cases.

Dynamic link travel times are first classified according to various applications. Subsequently, stochastic and deterministic travel time functions for longer and shorter time horizons are discussed separately, and two sets of functions are recommended for dynamic transportation network problems. The implications of those functional forms are analyzed and some modifications for dynamic network models are suggested. In addition, based on dynamic link travel time functions, we discuss how many independent variables are necessary to describe the temporal traffic flow and properly estimate the time-dependent travel time and how propagation over an arterial link. As a result, six link flow variables and corresponding link state and flow propagation equations are proposed as the basis to formulate dynamic transportation network models.

J	Chien, CC; Zhang, YP; Ioannou, PA				Chien, CC; Zhang, YP; Ioannou, PA			Traffic density control for automated highway systems	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						macroscopic traffic flow models; roadway controller; traffic density control; automated highway systems	REAL-TIME CONTROL; BOULEVARD-PERIPHERIQUE; SOUTHERN PART; FLOW	Traffic flow instabilities such as traffic congestion are often caused by ad hoc and inappropriate speeds and headways that humans choose when they operate their vehicles. In an automated highway system (AHS) environment, the driver's actions are replaced by those of a computer control system that is designed to optimize traffic flow. On the microscopic level, each vehicle is driven by a computer control system, which, based on the actions of the surrounding vehicles, sends the appropriate commands to the throttle/brake/steering actuators. On the macroscopic level, a roadway controller calculates the desired speed commands to be followed by vehicles in each section of the freeway lanes in order to achieve desired traffic density distributions that lead to optimum traffic flow conditions. In this paper, we design, analyze and simulate a roadway controller for an automated highway that achieves desired traffic densities along the lane. A macroscopic traffic flow model that is modified for AHS operation is used for control design and analysis. We show that the proposed roadway controller guarantees exponential convergence of the traffic density at each section to the desired density. Simulation results are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller and the significant benefits AHS may bring to traffic flow. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Martin, PT				Martin, PT			Turning movement estimation in real time	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								Fast processors offer exciting opportunities for real-time traffic monitoring. Conventional transportation planning models that assume stable and predictable travel patterns do not lend themselves to on-line traffic forecasting. This paper describes how a new traffic flow inference model has the potential to determine comprehensive flow information in real time. Its philosophical basis is borrowed from the field of operational research, where it has been used for optimizing water and electricity flows. This paper shows how road traffic turning movement flows can be estimated from link detected flows at small recurrent intervals, in real time. The paper details the formulation of the problem, outlines the structure of the data set that provides the detector data for the model input and observed turning flows for the model evaluation. The theoretical principles that define the model are described briefly. Turning movement flow estimates, at 5-min intervals, from two independent surveys are presented and analyzed. The results show an overall mean coefficient of determination (r(2)) of 79-82% between observed and modeled turning movement flows.

J	Smith, BL; Demetsky, MJ				Smith, BL; Demetsky, MJ			Traffic flow forecasting: Comparison of modeling approaches	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The capability to forecast traffic volume in an operational setting has been identified as a critical need for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). In particular, traffic volume forecasts will support proactive, dynamic traffic control. However, previous attempts to develop traffic volume forecasting models have met with limited success. This research effort focused on developing traffic volume forecasting models for two sites on Northern Virginia's Capital Beltway. Four models were developed and tested for the freeway traffic flow forecasting problem, which is defined as estimating traffic flow 15 min into the future. They were the historical average, time-series, neural network, and nonparametric regression models. The nonparametric regression model significantly outperformed the other models. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test revealed that the nonparametric regression model experienced significantly lower errors than the other models. In addition, the nonparametric regression model was easy to implement, and proved to be portable, performing well at two distinct sites. Based on its success, research is ongoing to refine the nonparametric regression model and to extend it to produce multiple interval forecasts.

J	Bring, A; Malmstrom, TG; Boman, CA				Bring, A; Malmstrom, TG; Boman, CA			Simulation and measurement of road tunnel ventilation	TUNNELLING AND UNDERGROUND SPACE TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								A computer program for PC has been prepared to simplify studies of air flows in road tunnels and the related problem of pollution concentration due to emission from vehicles. Results from simulations include air pressures, flow rates, and pollution concentrations along the tunnel. Input data are tunnel geometry including flow friction factors and loss coefficients, plus traffic and emission data and air pressures at boundaries. The program has been prepared in the IDA environment for modular simulation. All mathematical models have been formulated in the Neutral Model Format (NMF) [Sahlin 1994]. The program has been validated by comparisons with older programs (Malmstrom 1980). Advantages of the new program, as compared to traditional programs, are its great flexibility, ease of maintenance, and extendibility, as well as the very moderate implementation time. It has proved to be a useful tool for studying alternative ventilation concepts for road tunnels. Air flow rates have been measured in part of the "Soderledstunneln," a much-used road tunnel in central Stockholm. The measurements were made with tracer gas technique, which made it possible to measure without disturbing the traffic flow through the tunnel. The measurements have been compared to simulations of the air pour. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The first of a two-stage learning process optimizes the control of steady-state traffic at a single intersection and over a network of streets. The second stage of learning deals with predictive/reactive control in responding to sudden changes in traffic patterns. The system can also display, store and retrieve information about traffic flow, intersection geometry, signalization, and performance of three- and four-leg intersections. In a design setup, it can compute the economically most advantageous geometry for an intersection, given the traffic flow and acceptable levels of service. The system has been tested in the laboratory on a range of scenarios (in terms of geometry and traffic flow) and has been found to perform as expected. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

J	Peng, H				Peng, H			Distributed link-layer control for automated highway systems	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								The modeling and design of a link-layer control algorithm for automated highway systems are presented in this paper. Link-layer control systems address the coordination of traffic on a stretch of highway, and serve as the intermediate layer between traffic management (ATMS) and vehicle control (AVCS) systems. The key role of the link layer control system is to use macroscopic traffic information for improved traffic flow. A distributed control algorithm is developed based on optimal control theory. The proposed control law is implemented in a simulation program which keeps track of the motions of each individual vehicles on the highway. Simulation results under three perturbed conditions-uneven traffic distribution, broken vehicle, and traffic merging-are presented.

J	Heidemann, D; Wegmann, H				Heidemann, D; Wegmann, H			Queueing at unsignalized intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							PRIORITY INTERSECTIONS; DELAY; CAPACITY	A general queueing theory model for traffic flow at unsignalized intersections is described and analysed which contains most of the mathematical models developed in the literature as special cases. Thus a consistent approach is presented for obtaining these models from a general viewpoint. Included are green-red models which are based on an analogy to traffic signals. Critical gaps and merging times or move-up times are allowed to be stochastically dependent. Inconsistent and consistent driver behaviour is considered. Platooning of the major road traffic with random intra-bunch headways is included. The results focus on the distributions of queue lengths and delays and, in particular, on capacities. A general capacity formula is developed and it is shown how the various capacity formulas from the literature come out as special cases. Some numerical results are presented.

J	Lee, JK; Lee, JJ				Lee, JK; Lee, JJ			Discrete event modeling and simulation for flow control in an automated highway system	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						automated highway system; discrete event modeling/simulation; DEVS formalism		This paper considers a lane routing problem in an Automated Highway System (AHS). Lane routing is important because the problem of managing the traffic flow on a multilane AHS plays a major role in an urban environment. On the other hand, because analytical approaches are impossible for various, almost unpredictable traffic situations, traffic simulations are indispensible for the design and the evaluation of various control strategies of the AHS. The discrete event modeling technique can be employed to describe both macroscopic and microscopic models according to the level of abstraction. The DEVS (Discrete Event System Specification) formalism has been employed for traffic modeling and simulation of the AHS. In this paper, we propose a lane routing algorithm for vehicles entering the highway to exit successfully at their destinations while balancing the lane capacity usage of the highway (even in the face of lane-blocking incident). After that, we present a methodology for the performance evaluation of the proposed algorithm using discrete event modeling and simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm gives good performance for traffic flow control in the AHS. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Chiquetto, S				Chiquetto, S			The environmental impacts from the implementation of a pedestrianization scheme	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article							MODEL	Road transport is by Far the major source of environmental degradation in urban centres. Hence, transport schemes like pedestrianization can have significant impacts on local environmental conditions, by provoking changes in the characteristics of traffic flows and on the patterns of traffic emissions. This paper analyses the extent to which the implementation of a pedestrianization scheme in Chester (a medium-sized historic city situated in northwest England) can influence the total vehicle exhaust emissions and local levels of air pollution concentration and noise from traffic. The analysis is based on the application of a road traffic assignment model in conjunction with models for the estimation of environmental degradation. This approach provides decision-makers with valuable information about the environmental implications from changes in the characteristics of the transport system. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It simulates the traffic flow on motorways with a specific view on vehicle affairs. One application for PELOPS was the assessment of ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control) systems inside the PROMETHEUS program. It was shown, that PELOPS is a powerful tool for the analysis of new technologies. A new research period will extend the use of ACC about the functionality in urban areas. This requires an extension of PELOPS about some specific models. With this extension it is possible, to analyse new traffic technologies for the individual vehicles or the infrastructure. In a first step, PELOPS is extended about functions for suburban areas. This effects mainly the modelling of the driver behaviour. The driver behaviour is related to the traffic situation. In contrast to the normal traffic flow on motorways, the driver has to stop and go in the suburban area, he has to control lower distances and he has to react on other vehicles on cross-roads. New concepts for these functions are included in PELOPS and calibrated by detailed traffic data from a video observation and floating car measurements in the surrounding of Aachen. Based on the traffic measurement near Aachen, different scenarios are simulated to improve the traffic flow and to relieve the environment. These scenarios include ACC systems, inter-vehicle-communication and intelligent traffic lights. The paper shows some information's about the simulation technic and the results from the described analysis.

J	Helbing, D; Greiner, A				Helbing, D; Greiner, A			Modeling and simulation of multilane traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article								A most important aspect in the field of traffic modeling is the simulation of bottleneck situations. For their realistic description a macroscopic multilane model for unidirectional freeways including acceleration, deceleration, velocity fluctuations, overtaking, and lane-changing maneuvers is systematically deduced from a gas-kinetic (Boltzmann-like) approach. The resulting equations contain corrections with respect to previous models.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Kinetic segregation in a multilane highway traffic flow	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article							MODELS; TRANSITION; CONGESTION	A traffic model is presented to study the segregation of cars on a multilane highway. When a fast (slow) car overtakes (is overtaken by) a slow (fast) car, the fist (slow) car shifts to the outer (inner) lane. The traffic kinetics on a multilane highway is described in terms of Boltzmann-like kinetic equations. The segregation of cars between lanes is studied by deriving the velocity distribution on each lane from the kinetic equations. The discrete versions of the kinetic equations are presented to solve numerically these equations. The time evolutions of velocity distributions on the lanes are calculated by numerical method. The velocity distributions on two-lane, three-lane, four-lane and five-lane highways in a steady state are also derived numerically. It is shown that the slower cars gather on the inner lanes, the faster cars gather on the outer lanes and then a segregation occurs by changing lanes.

One of the proposed solutions to this problem is dynamic traffic management (DTM): the management of traffic flows, vehicles and traffic demand based on data representing the current and near expected traffic situation. A key ingredient for DTM is accurate network-wide short-term traffic forecasts. This article gives a general overview of the state of the art together with some recent advances and applications derived from a number of field trials conducted as part of the DRIVE-II programme of the Commission of the European Communities. The article gives an introduction to DTM, and reviews the nature of traffic demand and supply and the traffic measurement process. The statistical methodology of short-term forecasts applied in transport is discussed and the articles in this issue are introduced. Mention is made of as yet unresolved problems. The article concludes that a great deal of work still remains to be done before the current methodology can consistently provide the desired level of accuracy needed for DTM. In the near future, more research will be needed and carried out, both with respect to methods already available, to methods available but not yet applied and perhaps to develop new methodology.

This method is useful to support real-time traffic management of a freeway network. The proposed indirect approach combines historical information with traffic counts at on-ramps. It has been tested on the Italian freeway A4, where the existing pay toll system enables us to measure the real origin-destination matrices. The results show that these prediction procedures can perform almost as well as direct prediction methods based on knowledge of the demand.

This is the first time that such methods are studied from the point of view of parallel computing. We studied and implemented an implicit numerical method for solving the high-order flow conservation traffic model on parallel computers. Implicit methods allow much larger time-step than explicit methods, for the same accuracy. However, at each time-step a nonlinear system must be solved. We used the Newton method coupled with a linear iterative method (Orthomin). We accelerated the convergence of Orthomin with parallel incomplete LU factorization preconditionings. We ran simulation tests with real traffic data from an 12-mile freeway section (in Minnesota) on the nCUBE2 parallel computer. These tests gave the same accuracy as past tests, which were performed on one-processor computers, and the overall execution time was significantly reduced.

In contrast to previous approaches we do not use the occupation number of sites as dynamical variable but rather the distance between consecutive cars. Therefore certain longer-ranged correlations are taken into account and even a mean-field approach yields non-trivial results. In fact for the model with upsilon(max) = 1 the exact solution is reproduced. For upsilon(max) = 2 the fundamental diagram shows a good agreement with results from simulations.

The link layer is modeled using vehicle conservation Bow models. Desired traffic conditions on the highway are given by a pair of density and velocity profiles which are assumed to be consistent with the demand on, and the capability of, the highway system. The link layer control laws presented in this paper then stabilize the actual traffic condition to the desired values. Control laws are derived for three highway topologies: a single lane highway, a highway with multiple discrete lanes and a two-dimensional highway with an arbitrary flow pattern. The control laws obtained for each of the topologies is distributed and are suited for implementation in the lower levels of the AHS control hierarchy. Simulation results are also presented.

Starting from an equation describing the time evolution of the Boolean state variable at each site of the basic CA model, and using a two-site approximation for the multi-site correlation functions, a dynamical mapping between the macroscopic average speeds v(t + 1) and v(t) at different time can be derived. Mean field results consistent with the simulation data are obtained by considering the attractors of the mapping and their corresponding basins.

These data, obtained from a specially equipped measuring vehicle, were then combined with fuel consumption, CO2 and fleet exhaust emission factors determined by the Rhineland Technical Inspection Authority (TUV). CO, HC, NOx and particulates in the exhaust gas were examined. The ultimate target is to obtain an analysis of the changes in fuel consumption and exhaust emissions for this particular section of motorway. The benefits gained from traffic control systems more than compensate for their construction and annual operating costs: in particular, the advantages include a drop in the number of accidents, reduced journey times, a reduction in stop-and-go traffic, higher average journey speeds on severely congestion-prone motorway sections and reduced emissions in the morning hours thanks to more freely flowing traffic. This permits an improvement in traffic flow and can help to cope more easily with the forecast increase in traffic volume.

J	Wagner, D; Vercruyssen, M; Hancock, P				Wagner, D; Vercruyssen, M; Hancock, P			A computer-based methodology for evaluating the content of variable message signage	ITS JOURNAL			English	Article						intelligent transportation systems; variable (changeable) message signs; message content; work zone safety; mental workload; visual perception		Successful communication of traffic information to motorists via intelligent transportation systems (ITS) is critical for improved safety and traffic flow in high risk areas such as work zones. The conveyance of pertinent, real-time information through variable message signs (VMS) technology is integral to ITS. The content of messages presented on VMS is especially important given that drivers must detect, comprehend, and translate signage information while being occupied to some degree with the task of driving their vehicle. A simulation experiment was conducted, using a prototype dual-task methodology developed to examine message content of VMS in work zones and to assess the effect of message type, display type, sign content, and repeated exposure to the signs on message comprehension and translation. Twenty participants (mean age = 25 yrs) viewed a computer simulation of a section of road leading to a work zone site that had VMS along the road side. Signs were of two message types (speed vs. time signs), three display types (two inexpensive; one with full text wrap-around and one with partial wrap-around; and one expensive matrix of three lines by eight characters flashed twice), two similar message versions, and a complete repeat for reliability in a 2 x 3 x 2 x 2 repeated measures design. The primary task required attending to a grid line in the rearview mirror and remembering which signal had appeared. The concurrent, secondary task was reading the message content of VMS that were optically expanding at a rate comparable to traveling at 111 kilometers/hour (70 mph). Questions regarding the grid line signal and sign comprehension and interpretation followed. The results support this methodology's capacity to evaluate message content of VMS, especially in an ITS context. Message type significantly affected comprehension of sign content and translation of the consequences of the information conveyed, but display type did not influence responses to time or speed signs. This suggests a potential for substantial savings from the increased use of inexpensive displays instead of full-matrix units. Future research should involve assessment of the validity of the computer simulation, in addition to testing behavioral responses to message content either with a follow-up on-road and/or driving simulation study.

J	Hamed, MM; Easa, SM; Batayneh, RR				Hamed, MM; Easa, SM; Batayneh, RR			Disaggregate gap-acceptance model for unsignalized T-intersections	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article							BEHAVIOR; DURATION; DELAY	This paper develops a system of disaggregate models that accounts for the effect of intersection, driver, and traffic characteristics on gap acceptance for left-turn maneuvers at urban T-intersections controlled by stop signs on the minor roads. The waiting time for each driver is first modeled using the hazard function. The binary probit model is then used to find the drivers' probabilities of accepting or rejecting a gap. These probabilities are used to calculate the critical gaps of individual drivers. The expected waiting time is included in the model as an explanatory variable. A multiple regression model is used for predicting the intersection mean critical gap. To estimate the parameters of the models, disaggregate data were collected by observing and interviewing drivers at 15 urban T-intersections in the Greater Amman area. The results show that the distribution of critical gaps is influenced by driver socioeconomic characteristics, expected waiting time, time of day, and trip purpose. The mean critical gap is influenced by total opposing traffic flow, number of major-approach lanes, presence of a median with a left-turn lane, maneuver type, speed of major road, and time of day. The proposed methodology can be used to calculate the critical gaps of individual drivers and in turn, the mean critical gap at a specified intersection that is needed for delay and capacity analysis.

In the present study, an attempt is made to develop a methodology based on probabilistic approach for determining the possible traffic conflicts at urban uncontrolled intersections. The developed model is validated using field data. The model can be used for quick estimation of possible conflicts at urban uncontrolled intersection.

J	Sullivan, DP; Troutbeck, RJ				Sullivan, DP; Troutbeck, RJ			An exponential relationship for the proportion of free vehicles on arterial roads	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article							HEADWAY	The proportion of free vehicles on a road link is dependent on the geometry of the road link and the presence of intersections along the link. This paper details the investigation of the proportion of free vehicles as a function of the link geometry. It is necessary to define the effects of the link geometry before the effect of intersections on the headway distribution can be incorporated. Current methods for describing the proportion of free vehicles on a road link predominantly use linear relationships with the vehicle dow rate. An exponential relationship has been examined and found to be better suited to the modelling of the proportion of free vehicles than the existing linear relationships. In modelling the flow in each lane, the characteristics of the traffic flow were found to be dependent on the lane type being modelled. The kerb lane sustained a higher proportion of free vehicles than the median lane for similar dow rates. This finding is significant in the analysis of priority intersections. The difference is attributed to driver behaviour and is related to the expected ease of overtaking. Using these results the proportion of free vehicles is described as a function of the lane type, lane width and the vehicle dow rate through the use of exponential relationships. The influence of intersections upon the characteristics of the traffic flow can then be incorporated by describing the effect of the proportion of free vehicles on the road link.

This 'space syntax' model can provide good predictions of both pedestrian and vehicular flows throughout a city, and is currently being used commercially to predict the effect on both pedestrian and vehicular traffic flows of major urban projects. The main task of the project was to devise a method of measuring urban pollution at the scale of the street segment, in a reliable, accurate and inexpensive way. The monitoring equipment has been developed and measures carbon monoxide (CO), temperature, relative humidity, light level, and wind speed at 6 min intervals. This paper reports early results from a small number of these instruments. The main findings are that large differences in pollutant levels are found over small spatial distances and that pollutant concentrations are highly dependent on local wind speed.

The inventory also includes the estimation of speciated VOC emissions using fingerprints for different types of source. The results for the city as a whole indicate that the greatest contributors are motor vehicles, followed by industrial and domestic use of solvents. Motor vehicles contribute 48% of the total emissions of VOCs in the study area, compared to 32% for the national figure for the motor vehicle contribution in the UK. For those emission sources which it was possible to speciate, road transport contributed a large proportion, 58%, which was further increased to 64% if photochemical oxidant creation potential (POCP) weighting was undertaken to assess the significance for ozone generation. The result of spatial disaggregation indicates substantial differences in the relative significance of vehicular emissions from one place to another.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Kinetics of segregation in a two-lane highway traffic flow	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND GENERAL			English	Article							MODELS; TRANSITION; CONGESTION; JAMS	A particle-hopping model is presented to simulate the segregation of cars on a two-lane highway which consists of a slow lane and a fast lane. The changing of cars between the slow and fast lanes is taken into account. When a fast (slow) car overtakes (is overtaken by) a slow (fast) car on the slow (fast) lane, the fast (slow) car shifts to the fast (slow) lane. By satisfying the demand for faster movement, a segregation of cars occurs. The car densities, velocities and currents on the slow and fast lanes are calculated by computer simulation. The velocity distributions on the two lanes are also shown. It is found that the traffic current is enhanced by the changing of cars between two lanes. The kinetics of segregation between the slow and fast lanes is described in terms of a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The kinetic equation is solved by a numerical method. The velocity distributions, car densities, velocities and currents obtained from the kinetic equation are compared with the simulation results.

J	Ho, FS; Ioannou, P				Ho, FS; Ioannou, P			Traffic flow modeling and control using artificial neural networks	IEEE CONTROL SYSTEMS MAGAZINE			English	Article								In today's freeway traffic there is very little control that can effectively influence the flow of traffic and manage congestion. Apart from ramp metering, the flow of traffic is mainly influenced by the actions of individual drivers. These actions are very erratic. They differ from one place to another and are responsible for traffic flow instabilities that lead to congestion and inefficient use of highways. In this article we use an artificial neural network technique to model and control highway traffic in a single lane with no on- or off-ramps. The developed controllers generate the speed commands for each section of the lane that vehicles need to follow in order to achieve a desired traffic flow density distribution along the lane. In today's traffic, these speed commands could be communicated to drivers, who would then have to respond to them. This way raises human factors issues that need further investigation in order to assess possible benefits. In an automated highway environment, the speed commands could be communicated to the computer control system of the vehicle and followed directly without human errors and delays. In this article, we simulate an automated highway environment and designed roadway neural network controllers to alleviate congestion. We use simulations to demonstrate that the use of feedback control on the macroscopic level could bring dramatic improvements on the characteristics of traffic flow. The same methodology could be applied to traffic in multiple lanes with on- and off-ramps.		Ho, FS (corresponding author), UNIV SO CALIF,CTR ADV TRANSPORTAT TECHNOL,LOS ANGELES,CA 90089, USA.

Effect of car acceleration upon car clustering is studied by deriving the velocity distribution of cars. The discrete version of the kinetic equation is presented to solve numerically its equation. The time evolutions of velocity distributions are calculated by numerical method. The velocity distributions in a steady state are also derived numercally by taking into account deceleration. It is shown that the velocity distribution becomes broader and broader with increasing acceleration. It is found that the clustering, acceleration and deceleration have an important effect on the velocity distribution of cars.

J	MestertonGibbons, M				MestertonGibbons, M			Traffic flow at a T-junction: A sufficient condition for a left-turn lane	MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTER MODELLING			English	Article						T-junction; traffic flow; Markov chain		A previous model of a T-junction on a narrow, two-lane, major road yields a formula for the proportion of traffic configurations in which cars travelling past the junction along the major road are brought to a halt by cars turning left into the minor road. The proportion is expressed in terms of four parameters, namely, the two mean traffic flows on the major road, the probability of a left turn into the minor road, and the minimum time gap in the oncoming flow which that maneuver requires. If this proportion is higher than is deemed acceptable, then a left-turn lane is needed. The proportion was calculated in a previous article, but recently found errors invalidate that calculation (though not the model). Here the errors are corrected to yield a new sufficient condition for a left-turn lane at a T-junction.

J	vanderVoort, M; Dougherty, M; Watson, S				vanderVoort, M; Dougherty, M; Watson, S			Combining kohonen maps with arima time series models to forecast traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								A hybrid method of short-term traffic forecasting is introduced; the KARIMA method. The technique uses a Kohonen self-organizing map as an initial classifier; each class has an individually tuned ARIMA model associated with it. Using a Kohonen map which is hexagonal in layout eases the problem of defining the classes. The explicit separation of the tasks of classification and functional approximation greatly improves forecasting performance compared to either a single ARIMA model or a backpropagation neural network. The model is demonstrated by producing forecasts of traffic flow, at horizons of half an hour and an hour, for a French motorway. Performance is similar to that exhibited by other layered models, but the number of classes needed is much smaller (typically between two and four). Because the number of classes is small, it is concluded that the algorithm could be easily retrained in order to track long-term changes in traffic flow and should also prove to be readily transferrable.

J	Holland, CA; Conner, MT				Holland, CA; Conner, MT			Exceeding the speed limit: An evaluation of the effectiveness of a police intervention	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						driving; speed; warning signs; enforcement; intentions	COMMIT DRIVING VIOLATIONS; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; INTENTION; ERRORS	Driving too fast is probably one of the main contributors to the occurrence and severity of road accidents, and intention to speed is an important predictor of exceeding speed limits. This study examined the effect of a police intervention on exceeding the posted speed limit (speed of vehicles on the target road) and on intentions to speed (attitude questionnaire). The intervention consisted of a week in which 'police speed check area' warning signs were put up on the target 40 mph limit road, followed by a week of active police presence, followed by a further week in which the signs remained. The speed of vehicles was measured using police data collection equipment for a total of 7 weeks. The effect on the intentions of drivers using the road to exceed speed limits was assessed across age, sex and pre-intervention speeding behaviour using questionnaire measures. Fewer people broke the speed limit during the intervention than before, this effect lasting to a limited extent up to 9 weeks after police activity ceased and 8 weeks after signs were removed. The effect on drivers breaking the speed limit by large amounts was more transient. The intervention reduced intention to speed for subject groupings with high pre-intervention intention. Traffic flow contributed significantly to the variance in vehicle speed, but was not responsible for differences between the weeks, which may therefore be attributed to the intervention. Traffic flow also did not account for differences in speed between the two directions of traffic, which may therefore be attributed to the fact that the road areas preceding the target area in each direction differed in their speed limits (70 vs 30 mph). Intentions to speed, as well as speed adaptation difficulties are thought to contribute to these differences.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Self-organized criticality in 1D traffic flow	FRACTALS-AN INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL ON THE COMPLEX GEOMETRY OF NATURE			English	Article							JAMS	Annihilation process of traffic jams is investigated in a one-dimensional traffic flow on a highway. The one-dimensional fully asymmetric exclusion model with open boundaries for parallel update is extended to take into account stochastic transition of cars, where a car moves ahead with transition probability p(t). Near p(t) = 1, the system is driven asymptotically into a steady state exhibiting a self-organized criticality. Traffic jams with various lifetimes (or sizes) appear and disappear by colliding with an empty wave. The typical lifetime (m) of traffic jams scales as (m) approximate to Delta p(t)(-0.54+/-0.04), where Delta p(t) = 1 - p(t). It is shown that the cumulative lifetime distribution N-m(Delta p(t)) satisfies the scaling form N-m(Delta p(t)) approximate to Delta p(t)(1.1)f(m Delta p(t)(0.54)).

J	Kim, YA; Nakagawa, M				Kim, YA; Nakagawa, M			R-ALOHA protocol for SS inter-vehicle communication network using head spacing information	IEICE TRANSACTIONS ON COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						inter-vehicle communication network; spread spectrum; R-ALOHA protocol; head spacing information	PERFORMANCE	Recently, there have been intensive studies on protocol methods and applications of short range inter-vehicle communication network (SR-IVCN) and systems. The purpose of the studies is to improve the safety of road traffic systems and the smooth control of the traffic flow by providing information to vehicles. Spread spectrum (SS) communication systems are able to simultaneously communicate and measure the distance between the terminals, thus it is advantageous to apply the spread spectrum technique to inter-vehicle communications. This paper assumes that the Vehicles incidentally close to each other, form and manage a locally autonomous decentralized dynamic network. An R-ALOHA (Reservation-ALOHA) protocol for the spread spectrum inter-vehicle communication network using head spacing information is proposed which improve the conventional slot reservation methods. Since the near-far problem in SS communication is one reason for the degradation of system performance, this proposed scheme is shown to improve the efficiency of communication. The performance of the proposed system in the environment where the vehicles are assumed to run freely on a highway is verified by computer simulation. It is shown that inter-vehicle communication can be smoothly carried out between one vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using the propose method.

For the eastbound high speed cars, two models are considered. In the model I, the intrinsic velocity is defined for all eastbound cars. In the model II, the maximum velocity, acceleration and deceleration of the cars are taken into account. It has turned out that two new phases appear between the free-moving phase and the global jamming phase in both models. One is the one-sided blocking phase where the northbound cars block the high speed eastbound cars. Another is the mutual blocking phase where the cars on both roads are mutually blocked. The mean velocity of the cars and the size of the local jam are obtained.

The model is intended as a replacement of the traditional Urban Transportation planning System (UTPS) modeling system now in common use. Operating in a geographic-information system (GIS) environment, the model's heart is a Household Activity Simulator that determines the locations and travel patterns of household members daily activities in 3 categories: mandatory, flexible, and optional. The system produces traffic volumes on streets and land use intensity patterns, as well as typical travel outputs. The model is particularly well suited to analyzing issues related to the Clean Air Act and the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA). Implementation would, ideally, require an activity-based travel diary, but can be done with standard house-interview travel surveys. An implementation effort consisting of validation research in parallel with concurrent model programming is recommended.

J	Broucke, M; Varaiya, P				Broucke, M; Varaiya, P			A theory of traffic flow in automated highway systems	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article								This paper presents a theory for automated traffic Bow, based on an abstraction of vehicle activities like entry, exit and cruising, derived from a vehicle's automatic control laws. An activity is represented in the Row model by the space and time occupied by a vehicle engaged in that activity. The theory formulates Traffic Management Center (TMC) plans as the specification of the activities and velocity of vehicles, and the entry and exit flows for each highway section. We show that Rows that achieve capacity can be realized by stationary plans that also minimize travel time. These optimum plans can be calculated by solving a linear programming problem. The theory permits the study of transient phenomena such as congestion, and TMC feedback traffic rules designed to deal with transients. We propose a ''greedy'' TMC rule that always achieves capacity but does not minimize travel time. We undertake a microscopic study of the ''entry'' activity, and show how lack of coordination between entering vehicles and vehicles on the main line disrupts traffic Bow and increases travel time. We conclude by giving;some practical indication of how to obtain the space and time usage of activities from vehicle control laws. Finally, we illustrate the concepts presented in this paper with two examples of how the model is used to calculate the capacities of a one-lane automated highway system. In one example we study market penetration of adaptive cruise control and in the second example we study the effect of platooning maneuvers in a platooning architecture for AHS.

Vehicle detection is done in two stages. In stage one, the dimensional and morphological study of the analyzed highway is carried out in order to model and calibrate the vision system. In stage two, vehicles are detected owing to the method of matching clear and dark blobs. These are extracted by mathematical morphology techniques and bright headlight images by using pattern recognition techniques. The position of the vehicle allows access to spatial-temporal information which characterize traffic flow and permit automatic traffic control.

Having discussed the case of a bare highway, we then consider the presence of a junction. We study the effects of acceleration, disorder, and slow-to-start behaviour on the queue length at the entrance to the highway.

J	Liu, GQ; Lyrintzis, AS; Michalopoulos, PG				Liu, GQ; Lyrintzis, AS; Michalopoulos, PG			Modelling of freeway merging and diverging flow dynamics	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						traffic flow; continuum models	TRAFFIC DYNAMICS; SCHEMES	In this paper, a new high-order continuum model for a freeway with merging and diverging geometries is presented. Three formulations describing traffic friction at freeway merging or diverging areas are reviewed. A new formulation for traffic friction is proposed and compared with the existing formulations based on tests against field data. in addition, a numerical modification for avoiding unjustified upstream flow propagation that has been observed in high-order models is developed For this purpose, a Riemann problem-based method, namely the Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLLE) flux-difference splitting method is employed Intuitive tests demonstrate that such an approach can be eely successful in preventing the flow from moving at negative speed. Field data tests for merging and diverging freeway geometries show that implementation of the proposed high-order model with the HLLE method yields low error levels and is more accurate than the simple continuum model at congested flows. Furthermore the proposed formulation for traffic friction seems to yield a smaller error in volume than the existing formulations. In addition the proposed high-order model is less sensitive to the choice of the speed-density relationship.

J	Fwa, TF; Ang, BW				Fwa, TF; Ang, BW			Energy savings due to land transportation management in Singapore	JOURNAL OF ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION			English	Article								Singapore has been actively engaged in implementing various land transportation policies and traffic management schemes since the early 1970s to reduce traffic congestion. This paper examines the benefits in energy savings arising from the following five major schemes: (a) the Area Licensing Scheme, (b) the computerised Area Traffic control System, (c) the adaptive traffic control system, (d) the exclusive bus lane scheme, and (e) the island-wide expressway system. The analyses are made based on the findings of a two-year study that developed vehicle fuel consumption models for Singapore traffic. The Area Licensing Scheme that restricts traffic flow into the Central Business District (CBD) is found to have the greatest energy impact, followed by the island-wide expressway system and the traffic-signals control systems within the CBD.

Traffic intersections are the primitive elements of a transportation network and are characterized as event-driven and asynchronous systems. Petri networks have been utilized to model these discrete event systems; further analysis of their structure can reveal information relevant to the concurrency, parallelism, synchronization, and deadlock avoidance issues. The Petri-net model of a generic traffic junction is presented, with its deadlock avoidance property proven. These modular networks are effective in synchronizing their components and can be used for modeling purposes of an asynchronous large-scale transportation system. The derived model is suitable for simulations on a multiprocessor computer since its program execution safety is secured. The software pseudocode for simulating a transportation network model on a multiprocessor system is presented.

By calculating the power spectral density of temporal density fluctuations at a local section, we find that it exhibits a power law, being proportional to 1/f(1.8) where f is the frequency, in the noncongested Bow phase. The distribution of the headway distance h also follows a power law, being proportional to 1/h(3.0) The power-law fluctuations are destroyed by the occurrence of a traffic jam.

We take the computationally efficient model of Papageorgiou and test it on field data. We extend the model to flow under the influence of traffic-obstructing incidents. In applications where the interest is in mass phenomena and real time computation, a macroscopic model is preferable over microscopic models. This model also permits systematic parameter identification, which makes it more useful for real traffic systems. The influence of incidents on the highway is included in the model and it is possible to tune its parameters for flow under incidents. This allows the model to compute the effect of incidents on flow capacity using field data.

J	Grossmann, P				Grossmann, P			Monte-Carlo simulation of stochastic flow	GEC JOURNAL OF RESEARCH			English	Article						stochastic processes; Monte-Carlo simulation; road traffic flow		The general approach of Monte-Carlo simulation of stochastic flows is applied to some aspects of road traffic modelling. Recent growth in road traffic has led to increasing levels of congestion, pollution and accidents. One of the proposed solutions is the implementation of Advanced Transport Telematics (ATT) in the areas of traffic control, driver information and vehicle guidance. An important part of ATT is modelling and simulation of complex traffic phenomena. This paper presents an overview of some aspects of road traffic modelling and describes the development of a particular application of the Monte-Carlo simulation approach at the Hirst Division of GEC-Marconi Materials Technology Ltd. This is designed to provide an understanding of the connection between the driver's behaviour and the phenomena leading to congestion and traffic breakdown.

J	Nagatani, T				Nagatani, T			Effect of car acceleration on traffic flow in 1D stochastic CA model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article							JAMMING TRANSITION	The one-dimensional (1D) asymmetric simple-exclusion model with parallel update (the deterministic cellular automaton (CA) 184) is extended to take into account acceleration of cars. Velocity and acceleration are assigned to each particle (car). The acceleration of a car is determined by the dynamical equation of motion. The stochastic cellular automaton model mimics the traffic flow on a highway. In congested traffic flow, the properties of traffic jams are studied by computer simulation. The dependence of the propagating velocity of traffic jams upon car acceleration is shown. Also, a simple mean-field theory is given for the congested traffic flow. It is found that the propagating velocity of a traffic jam obtained from simulation agrees with the analytical result for not small values of car acceleration.

J	Hilliges, M; Weidlich, W				Hilliges, M; Weidlich, W			A phenomenological model for dynamic traffic flow in networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								A macroscopic model for dynamic traffic flow is presented. The main goal of the model is the real time simulation of large freeway networks with multiple sources and sinks. First, we introduce the model in its discrete formulation and consider some of its properties. It turns out, that our non-hydrodynamical ansatz for the flows results in a very advantageous behavior of the model. Next the fitting conditions at junctions of a traffic network are discussed. In the following sections we carry out a continuous approximation of our discrete model in order to derive stationary solutions and to consider the stability of the homogeneous one. It turns out, that for certain conditions unstable traffic flow occurs. In a subsequent section, we compare the stability of the discrete model and the corresponding continuous approximation. This confirms in retrospection the close similarities of both model versions. Finally we compare the results of our model with the results of another macroscopic model, that was recently suggested by Kerner and Konhauser [Phys. Rev. E 48, 2335-2338 (1993)].

The spread-spectrum communication is very useful in the realization of such a system since the data for the distance between vehicles are obtained, which is very important in driving the vehicle, as well as the communication. This paper considers the intervehicle communication network using the spread-spectrum system and proposes the medium access control (MAC) protocol for the autonomous distributed access control. To evaluate the performance of the proposed system, a computer simulation is executed for the environment where the vehicles um freely on a highway. It is shown that stable information exchange can be realized with vehicles running in nearby positions.

It is shown that this model may have no solution which satisfies the capacity constraints, but additional costs can be imposed on some network links so that an equilibrium solution that satisfies the capacity constraints always exists. These additional costs could be used as road pricing, in order to prevent traffic flow becoming unstable and/or producing unacceptable environmental damage. A method to calculate the additional costs is proposed and is used in a simple numerical example. The results so obtained are compared with the congestion tolls derived from the traditional economic theory.

A simulation model is applied in which the traffic flows are the aggregation of drivers' decisions. These decisions, in turn, are modelled using boundedly rational principles. The experiments performed focus on the relationship between the network wide performance, the level of market penetration, the quality of the information, and the en route switching propensity. The results indicate that if drivers behave according to boundedly rational principles without being provided with information in a road network with non-recurrent congestion, the road network will not be used efficiently in terms of travel time. In these circumstances, ATIS is useful. However, the commercial viability of ATIS might be frustrated by the quickly diminishing additional benefits to equipped drivers. Further, the complexity of the implications of ATIS is stressed by the strong interaction between, on the one hand, the level of market penetration, the quality of the information and the en route switching propensity and, on the other hand, the network wide performance.

Changes in cargo traffic volumes into a marine terminal, or in the surrounding traffic arteries, which carry this traffic, can significantly affect the terminal's operations. Conversely, activity at the terminal can have an impact on the traffic levels and congestion for a considerable distance from the terminal, This paper demonstrates a methodology useful for studying the impact of road traffic flows on marine container terminals located in highly congested areas. This model was developed at the request of the Virginia Center for world Trade and was used to answer three planning questions in the port of Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA-what would be the impact of: opening a new section of interstate highway, a projected doubling of container traffic at one terminal, and a daily unit train in the vicinity of another terminal. The problem was made more challenging by limited data-collection funds, None the less, the model was deemed valid by a panel of traffic experts and officials from several major state and private agencies involved in marine traffic management. The model results were subsequently a factor in two major decisions related to terminal management.

J	NAGATANI, T				NAGATANI, T			SELF-ORGANIZED CRITICALITY IN ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL WITH NOISE FOR FREEWAY TRAFFIC	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article							FLOW MODEL; UNIVERSALITY; TRANSITION; SURFACES	The one-dimensional asymmetric simple-exclusion model with open boundaries for parallel update is extended to take into account temporary stopping of particles. The model presents the traffic flow on a highway with temporary deceleration of cars. Introducing temporary stopping into the asymmetric simple-exclusion model drives the system asymptotically into a steady state exhibiting a self-organized criticality. In the self-organized critical state, start-stop waves (or traffic jams) appear with various sizes (or lifetimes). The typical interval [s] between consecutive jams scales as [s] approximate to L(v) with v = 0.51 +/- 0.05 where L is the system size. It is shown that the cumulative jam-interval distribution N-s(L) satisfies the finite-size scaling form N-s(L) approximate to L(-v)f(s/L(v)). Also, the typical lifetime [m] of traffic jams scales as [m]approximate to L(v) with v' = 0.52 +/- 0.05. The cumulative distribution N-m(L) of lifetimes satisfies the finite-size scaling form N-m(L)approximate to L(-1)g(m/L(v')).

J	DUNT, DR; ABRAMSON, MJ; ANDREASSEN, DC				DUNT, DR; ABRAMSON, MJ; ANDREASSEN, DC			ASSESSMENT OF THE FUTURE-IMPACT ON HEALTH OF A PROPOSED FREEWAY DEVELOPMENT	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							ROAD TRAFFIC NOISE; AIR-POLLUTION; CHILDREN; OZONE; DISTURBANCE; ANNOYANCE; EXPOSURE; SLEEP	This paper estimates the effect on health of traffic injury and air and noise pollution from a proposed inner-suburban freeway in Melbourne. We estimated levels of these health problems for the year 2001 using traffic flow projections for the presence and absence of the freeway. For noise and air pollution, it was necessary to use pollutant levels as proxies for levels of associated diseases and health states. In 2001, there will be an increase in all traffic movements in the study area but a decrease of 100 000 vehicle-kilometres per day on major roads, excluding the bypass. This is associated with a projected reduction in the study area of about 100 to 110 injuries of all types. The major air pollution problems associated with motor vehicle emissions are ozone and respirable particulates; sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide are unlikely to pose a health hazard. Levels of respirable particulates, lead and polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons are generally low. There should be no detectable increase in average or maximum noise levels adjacent to the freeway if attenuation measures are employed. A reduction in average and maximum noise levels should occur on some main roads in the affected area. The effects of the freeway on the area should be favourable to health, with reduction in traffic injury and noise-related health problems outweighing any risk of a small deterioration in respiratory health associated with atmospheric pollution.

J	Lam, WHK; Huang, HJ				Lam, WHK; Huang, HJ			Dynamic user optimal traffic assignment model for many to one travel demand	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							NETWORKS	A freeway or expressway corridor where all vehicles travel to the same destination such as the city centre is considered in this article, similar to the morning commute problem. A continuous time optimal control model that deals with the dynamic user optimal assignment for multiple origins and single destination is proposed. The splitting rates of traffic flows at each network node are defined as the control variables in this model. The optimality conditions are proved to be equivalent to the dynamic user optimal principle or user equilibrium of instantaneous travel cost. In order not to solve the complicated two-point boundary-value problem with substantial computational times for obtaining the optimal control solution, a steady state-costate solution algorithm is developed that generates an approximate solution to the network optimal control problem. This algorithm exploits advantage of the embedded network structure of the problem and would be computationally efficient. A numerical example with two peak period traffic demands which was drawn from the road network problem between Hong Kong and several adjacent cities of inland China is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, CF			A finite difference approximation of the kinematic wave model of traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							DYNAMICS	This article shows that if the kinematic wave model of freeway traffic flow in its general form is approximated by a particular type of finite difference equation, the finite difference results converge to the kinematic wave solution despite the existence of shocks in the latter. This result, which applies to initial and boundary condition problems with and without discontinuous data, is shown not to hold for other commonly used finite difference schemes. In the proposed approximation, the flow between two neighboring lattice points is the minimum of the two values returned by: (a) a ''sending'' function evaluated at the density prevailing at the upstream lattice point and (b) a ''receiving'' function evaluated at the downstream lattice point. The sending and receiving functions correspond to the increasing and decreasing branches of the freeway's flow-density curve. The article presents an asymptotic formula for the errors introduced by the proposed finite difference approximation and describes quantitatively the finite difference's shock-capturing behavior. Errors are shown to be approximately proportional to the mesh spacing with a coefficient of proportionality that depends on the wave speed, on its rate of change with density, and on the slope and curvature of the initial density profile. The asymptotic errors are smaller than those of Lax's first-order, centered difference method which is also convergent. More importantly though, the proposed procedure never yields negative flows, and this makes it attractive in practical engineering applications when the mesh cannot be made arbitrarily small.

J	Daganzo, CF				Daganzo, CF			Requiem for second-order fluid approximations of traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								Although the ''first order'' continuum theory of highway traffic proposed by Lighthill and Whitham (1955) and Richards (1956)-the LWR model-can predict some things rather well, it is also known to have some deficiencies. In an attempt to correct some of these, ''higher order'' theories have been proposed starting in the early 70s. Unfortunately, the usefulness of these improvements can be questioned. This note describes the logical flaws in the arguments that have been advanced to derive higher order continuum models, and shows that the proposed high order modifications lead to a fundamentally flawed model structure. The modifications can actually make things worse. As an illustration of this, it is shown that any continuum model of traffic flow that smooths out all discontinuities in density will predict negative flows and negative speeds (i.e., ''wrong way travel'') under certain conditions. Such unreasonable predictions are made by all existing models formulated as a quasilinear system of partial differential equations in speed, density, and (sometimes) other variables but not by the LWR model. The note discusses the available empirical evidence and ends with a (hopefully positive) commentary on what can be accomplished with first-order models.

J	JENSEN, SS				JENSEN, SS			DRIVING PATTERNS AND EMISSIONS FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF ROADS	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	3rd International Symposium on Transport and Air Pollution	JUN 06-10, 1994	AVIGNON, FRANCE			DRIVING PATTERNS; COLD START EMISSIONS; TRAVEL SPEED; ROAD TYPE; PETROL-POWERED PASSENGER CARS; CATALYTIC CONVERTERS		The project evaluates the relationship between emissions and travel speeds on different types of roads such as city streets, highways, express roads and motorways. Approximately 800 measured driving patterns of 13 streets and roads have been analysed and emissions have been predicted in an emission model, also taking into account deterioration factors and cold start emissions. The result of the analysis is a clear relationship between travel speed (trip length divided by trip time) in the range of 10-120 km/h and emissions from all vehicle types. For petrol-powered passenger cars catalysts reduce HC, CO and NOx emissions by 70-80% on main roads and by 60-75% on city streets. The difference is due to the proportion of cold engines in city traffic. In city streets, when cars with cold engines are included, the emissions of CO and HC from petrol-powered passenger cars are found to be 10-20% and 5-10% higher, respectively. Travel speed - and not the type of road - is crucial to the level of emissions. However, express roads have slightly higher emission levels than motorways at similar travel speeds, presumably because traffic flows are less steady on express roads than on motorways.

For reasons of practicability and costs, exhaust gas emissions and fuel consumption of 34 different diesel engines have been measured on dynamic engine test benches. Using these engines, the fleet of heavy duty trucks and buses in the Federal Rebublic of Germany for the reference years 1986 and 1990 can be represented. From the engines' emission data sets, and data concerning the drive train and the driving resistance of representative vehicles, the exhaust emission behaviour of more than 300 different types of trucks and buses could be simulated on the basis of a newly developed method. It is therefore possible to calculate exhaust emission and fuel consumption factors for all categories of the entire fleet of heavy duty vehicles taking into account the road category, gradient, load factor and traffic flow conditions. This new method allows the determination of exhaust emission and fuel consumption factors for a broad range of different scales, from the emission simulation for a single vehicle up to global emission assessments.

This work analyses the extent to which some policies and future trends would influence local levels of air pollution concentration in an urban area. The analysis is based on the application of a road traffic assignment model, in conjunction with an air pollution dispersion model, to the urban road network of Chester, England. The former model simulates the traffic flow conditions, whereas the latter estimates the concentration of five main traffic pollutants at receptor points around road junctions. Actual vehicle exhaust emission rates are input into the dispersion model, as a function of fuel type, fitting of catalytic converters and typical driving operating patterns. Changes in pollutant concentrations are estimated from the implementation of a pedestrianisation scheme in the central area. Furthermore, the effects of traffic growth and the increasing participation of diesels and catalysts in the vehicle market are analysed.

J	SHARMA, SC; WU, YQ; RIZAK, SN				SHARMA, SC; WU, YQ; RIZAK, SN			DETERMINATION OF DDHV FROM DIRECTIONAL TRAFFIC FLOWS	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The traditional two-way design-hour volume (DHV) is multiplied with directional split (D) to obtain the value of directional design-hour volume (DDHV) for multilane highways. A number of previous studies have revealed some limitations of this method. It has been found that the approach of deriving the DDHV from the two-way design hourly volume could fail in appropriately recognizing the peaking characteristics of traffic in the two individual directions of traffic flow. In addition, by applying the traditional approach, even in the cases of permanent traffic counter (PTC) sites at which data are available for the whole year, an analyst could underestimate or overestimate the value of DDHV. Such limitations of the traditional approach have been attributed mainly to the highly variable nature of directional split. Presented in this paper is an approach of determining DDHV from directional flows rather than using a directional-split Value to derive DDHV from DHV. Highway-traffic data from PTC sites on Alberta, Canada, and Minnesota highway networks are used to describe the proposed methodology in which the two directional flows at a site are treated as two different traffic streams. One-way highest hourly volumes are ranked to obtain the required DDHV value without the application of directional split. The main advantage of the suggested approach is that it does not require the use of the directional-split variable, which can be a major source of error in the estimation of DDHV. Application of the proposed approach is particularly suitable for operational analysis of multilane highways.

In a certain range of traffic density, steady flow becomes unstable against the growth of a cluster, or ''phantom'' traffic jam, which moves at a slower speed than the otherwise homogeneous flow. We show that near the onset of this instability, traffic flow is described by a perturbed Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation. The traffic jam can be identified with a soliton solution of the KdV equation. The perturbation terms select a unique member of the continuous family of KdV solitons. These results may also apply to the dynamics of granular relaxation.

Once again, we have been reminded how unprepared we are for natural disasters. In this paper we present a conceptual framework for an effective, integrated, and modular decision support system (DSS) for hurricane emergency management. As an important component of this decision support system, we have been developing a PC-based emergency hurricane evacuation planning module, Regional Evacuation Modeling System (REMS), at the University of Florida since 1990. The software uses simulation as well as several network optimization models in estimating the evacuation time and the traffic flow on a given transportation road network. The system is very robust and user friendly. One of the important features of REMS is its ability to be used in real time.

A major survey of traffic speed and volume within the CBD was conducted in 1990. The speed data were collected using a fleet of floating cars which moved around two fixed survey circuits for 3 days. In the modelling process that followed, several approaches and mathematical models were studied. The final, recommended model relates journey speeds inside the Zone with the average traffic flow per lane inside the area which, in turn, is correlated with the cordon traffic volume. Thus, the model allows one to estimate average journey speed inside the Zone, based on the total traffic flow crossing the Zone cordon.

While U-turning vehicles are usually mixed with left-turning vehicles in inside or left-turn lanes and conflict with opposing through traffic as left-turning vehicles, the vehicle operating characteristics are different. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effects of U-turns on the traffic flow in left-turn lanes. Field data of 600 headways of left-turning passenger cars and 160 headways of U-turning passenger cars are recorded. The average headways of U-turning passenger cars are found to be significantly larger than those of left-turning passenger cars. The effects of U-turning vehicles depend upon the percent of U-turning vehicles in the left-turn lane, as well as the order of formation in the traffic stream. Adjustment factors for varying percents of U-turning vehicles in left-turn lanes are established.		TSAO, SM (corresponding author), NATL TAIWAN UNIV,DEPT CIVIL ENGN,TAIPEI 10764,TAIWAN.

J	DAGANZO, CF				DAGANZO, CF			THE CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL .2. NETWORK TRAFFIC	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							DYNAMICS	This article shows how the evolution of multi-commodity traffic flows over complex networks can be predicted over time, based on a simple macroscopic computer representation of traffic flow that is consistent with the kinematic wave theory under all traffic conditions. The method does not use ad hoc procedures to treat special situations. After a brief review of the basic model for one link, the article describes how three-legged junctions can be modeled. It then introduces a numerical procedure for networks, assuming that a time-varying origin-destination (O-D) table is given and that the proportion of turns at every junction is known. These assumptions are reasonable for numerical analysis of disaster evacuation plans. The results are then extended to the case where, instead of the turning proportions, the best routes to each destination from every junction are known at all times. For technical reasons explained in the text, the procedure is more complicated in this case, requiring more computer memory and more time for execution. The effort is estimated to be about an older of magnitude greater than for the static traffic assignment problem on a network of the same size. The procedure is ideally suited for parallel computing. It is hoped that the results in the article wilt lead to more realistic models of freeway flow, disaster evacuations and dynamic traffic assignment for the evening commute.

The data sources are used independently to obtain two distinct algorithms. This approach is undertaken to increase the overall coverage of incident detection capabilities as early implementation will result in relatively few cases when data is available from both fixed detectors and probe vehicles on the same link and during the same time period. The algorithms were developed using simulation data for the ADVANCE ITS operational test; they will subsequently be recalibrated with field data collected during the ADVANCE demonstration project. Discriminant analysis was used to estimate a variety of models based on different traffic flow measures from each data source. Various functions of fixed detector measures (volume and occupancy) and probe vehicle travel times were considered for inclusion in the fixed detector and probe vehicle algorithms, respectively. The most effective variables for detecting incidents were volume divided by occupancy (which is related to average speed) for fixed detectors and average speed for probe vehicles. In both cases, traffic measures for the incident link were most useful for incidents located in the downstream portion of the link and for the next upstream link for incidents located at the upstream end or in the middle portion of the link. Further, it was generally found that data from a single link provided almost equally good incident detection as data obtained from pairs of links. This led to the development of an algorithm that uses data from a single detector or link, thereby supporting incident detection on any link that has a current data independent of data availability from other links. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using detection rates and false alarm rates, which were found to be in the same range for both the algorithms. The fixed detector algorithm showed better detection ability, but its use is limited by the number of detectorized links in the network, while the performance of the probe vehicle algorithm was dependent on the number of reports available per time period.

Headway samples of 1,320 passenger cars and 722 heavy vehicles were measured in the field. Average headways were calculated for traffic flows of all passenger cars and all heavy vehicles in through lanes and left-turn lanes, respectively. The results show that different adjustment factors should be applied for through heavy vehicles and for left-turning heavy vehicles in calculating saturation flow rates. The adjustment factors for left turns should also be differentiated in accordance with the percent of heavy vehicles in traffic flow. Almost all estimated adjustment factors were found to be less than the corresponding figures suggested by the 1985 ''Highway Capacity Manual.'' A revised procedure is recommended for evaluating traffic conditions in Taipei. Similar studies may be desirable for cities in other parts of the world to verify the validity of the current procedures.

Inherent in stochastic queueing methods is the assumption that the system in question operates at steady state for the duration of the analysis period. The validity of this assumption with respect to traffic-flow facilities is, at times, in question. It is therefore somewhat surprising that the vast body of literature concerned with the application of stochastic queueing methods for the assessment of highway operation includes very little discussion on the relevance of the steady-state assumption. This paper presents a simulation-based methodology for evaluating the appropriateness of the steady-state assumption. The methodology is demonstrated using a particular type of highway facility-a two-lane highway work zone. Application of the methodology suggests that the assumption of steady-state operation may not always be reasonable and, as such, illustrates the potential need to investigate the steady-state tendencies of a facility type prior to exploiting stochastic queueing techniques.

The traffic flow model is presented by the one-dimensional asymmetric exclusion model with injection or extraction of particles. The system is driven asymptotically into a steady state exhibiting a self-organized criticality. The typical interval [s] between consecutive jams scales as [s] approximate to L(upsilon) with upsilon = 0.62 +/- 0.04 where L is the system size. It is shown that the jam-interval distribution n(s)(L) satisfies the finite-size scaling form n(s)(L)approximate to L(-beta) f(s/L(upsilon)) with beta = 2 upsilon.

The program may be used to understand how an AHS would perform under various control policies in terms of highway capacity, traffic flow, and other performance measures of interest to transportation system planners and engineers. SmartPath also can be used to test, simulate, and evaluate the performance of the designs of different modules and instrumentations like engine models, sensors, and communications. The package consists of two separate modules: simulation and animation. The animation program runs on Silicon Graphics workstations and the simulation runs on Sun Sparc or Silicon Graphics workstations. The animation program produces a three-dimensional color animation of AHS traffic. SmartPath is a microsimulation: the system elements and the control policies are each individually modeled. The control policies are, for the most part, parametrically specified, so users can study the performance variations by changing the specifications. In this paper, we discuss the modeling of the basic elements of SmartPath. We describe the organization of these elements in the simulation and the assumptions underlying the design, such as availability of certain communication infrastructure and appropriate sensors.

The rule-based controller determines ramp discharge rates based on upstream, downstream, and adjacent freeway occupancy levels. Rule-based strategies offer the advantage of real-time performance for freeway traffic management. Additionally, knowledge from traffic control engineers can be directly incorporated into the control strategies. Evolutionary programming is used to adapt rule thresholds so that this general procedure can be applied to any freeway configuration. A rule set is presented that operates on sensed occupancy rates. Evolutionary optimization of these sensor occupancy rate thresholds is described. The proposed method is then evaluated using INTRAS simulations of a uniform freeway segment. The results demonstrate that evolutionary programming is a viable approach for improving knowledge-based ramp metering control strategies that can alleviate both recurrent and non-recurrent freeway congestion. The presented study focuses on ramp meter control which, by itself, is effective only over a narrow regime of traffic flow conditions. Consideration is not given to ramp queues, surface street congestion, or traffic diversion on arterial roadways.

J	PENG, H				PENG, H			HIGHWAY-LEVEL VEHICLE CONTROL FOR AHS	IVHS JOURNAL			English	Article						ADVANCED VEHICLE CONTROL SYSTEMS; AUTOMATED HIGHWAY SYSTEMS; LINK-LAYER VEHICLE CONTROL	LONGITUDINAL CONTROL; SYSTEM	Current research on advanced vehicle control systems (AVCS) emphasizes the regulation of individual vehicles from a vehicle-level point of view. To improve the roadway operational efficiency, however, it is necessary to coordinate the operations of the vehicles on the highway. In this paper, a highway-level control algorithm is proposed which optimizes the traffic flow from a system-level viewpoint. The highway is divided into cells. The density and average speed of vehicles in these cells are assumed to be measured in real-time. Desired vehicle acceleration and lane change commands are assumed to be transmitted through communication devices to the vehicles, which optimize the traffic flow over the whole highway section. The system-wide traffic is optimized by using the downstream traffic status as the ''preview'' information for upstream traffic regulation. Numerical simulations were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithms.

The model presents the traffic flow on a highway with inflow or outflow of cars. Introducing injection or extraction of particles into the asymmetric simple-exclusion model drives the system asymptotically into a steady state exhibiting a self-organized criticality. The typical lifetime [m] of traffic jams scales as [m] approximate to L(v) with v = 0.65 +/- 0.04. It is shown that the cumulative distribution N-m(L) of life-times satisfies the finite-size scaling form N-m(L) approximate to L(-1)f(m/L(v)).

Here we present and study such a system with a k-stage blocking scheme in which processing in each station requires attendance of the server of that station together with the servers of the next k - 1 stations. This scheme describes the conventional manufacturing and communications blocking schemes but is also representative of a wider range of applications. Explicit expressions for residence times, throughput, queueing times, waiting times and other measures of performance are obtained for the case of communications type flow and just-in-time input. Use of the results in modeling and analyzing a highway traffic flow situation is presented.

A detailed history of the construction, maintenance and classified traffic flows for the road was available from Durham County Council (DCC) and, together with typical axle loads from the Traffic Loading Unit (TLU), University of Newcastle upon Tyne, the study estimated actual exponent values for sections of public road assuming that a power law relationship existed between structural wear and wheel load. The study showed that the actual power exponent values varied between 0.02 to 7.16 and, for exponent values that were significantly different to 4, an initial pavement design life of 20 years would no longer minimize whole life cost. The consequences of this finding are far-reaching for the design and management of road pavements.

The design goal is the Road Utilization Learning Expert System (RULES), an expert system that selects an appropriate path utilizing thought processes that the human expert would follow given various dynamic inputs and their expert knowledge. The survey results indicated that about 70% of police and fire chiefs nationwide would trust a computer with the task of dispatching their units, and that these respondents chose a computer system containing the knowledge of all human experts in the department as a method that elicits the greatest confidence and trust. In addition, many respondents expressed the need for verification of the suggested routes by human expert consultation. High degrees of relevance to the prediction of traffic flow were assigned to time of day, day of week, construction, and weather patterns. The validity of the results was verified by statistical analysis of responses to questions that had been designed for that purpose. We report on survey data critical to the design of the expert system and suggest that future emergency service dispatching systems requires expert computer assistance.

A dynamic model of traffic flow is presented that describes the formation and development of the traffic jam based on the theory of kinematic waves. I demonstrate the dynamic externality present when traffic is jammed. Furthermore, I obtained some results that differ from those based on the conventional approach: (a) the cost curve for travel on a long road does not include the backward-bending section that appears in the conventional approach; (b) I allow for traffic jams during optimal use of road.

The system is constructed and operated on the parallel computer AP1000. A database of a road network is implemented with the object-oriented programming technique. Elements of a road network are regarded as objects, and vehicles which move on the lanes are regarded as attributive data. The database is divided into sub-databases and assigned to each processor. The system calculates the behavior of vehicles in parallel, Sending and receiving data among the objects are carried out with message passing on the communication network, Moreover, we show the results of the vehicles behavior, and evaluate the parallel efficiency.

In this model, each ''car'' moves ballistically at its initial velocity until it overtakes the preceding car or cluster. After this encounter, the incident car assumes the velocity of the cluster which it has just joined. The properties of the initial distribution of velocities in the small-velocity limit control the long-time properties of the aggregation process. For an initial velocity distribution with a power-law tail at small velocities, P0(v) approximately v(mu) as upsilon --> 0, a simple scaling argument shows that the average cluster size grows as m approximately t(mu + 1)/(mu + 2) and that the average velocity decays as upsilon approximately t-1/(mu + 2) as t --> infinity. We derive an analytical solution for the survival probability of a single car and an asymptotically exact expression for the joint mass-velocity distribution function. We also consider the properties of spatially heterogeneous traffic and the kinetics of traffic clustering in the presence of an input of cars.

J	DAGANZO, CF				DAGANZO, CF			THE CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL - A DYNAMIC REPRESENTATION OF HIGHWAY TRAFFIC CONSISTENT WITH THE HYDRODYNAMIC THEORY	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							URBAN ARTERIAL STREETS; CONGESTED CONDITIONS; FLOW	This paper presents a simple representation of traffic on a highway with a single entrance and exit. The representation can be used to predict traffic's evolution over time and space, including transient phenomena such as the building, propagation, and dissipation of queues. The easy-to-solve difference equations used to predict traffic's evolution are shown to be the discrete analog of the differential equations arising from a special case of the hydrodynamic model of traffic flow. The proposed method automatically generates appropriate changes in density at locations where the hydrodynamic theory would call for a shockwave; i.e., a jump in density such as those typically seen at the end of every queue. The complex side calculations required by classical methods to keep track of shockwaves are thus eliminated. The paper also shows how the equations can mimic the real-life development of stop-and-go traffic within moving queues.

The effect of different individual driving patterns is estimated by monitoring the traffic flow, the velocity and acceleration distributions, the average number of accidents, and the distribution of density-waves (traffic jams) as a function of traffic density. The number of accidents, traffic jams, and the fuel consumption are drastically reduced by driving strategies adapting to local traffic conditions. At high traffic densities this leads, however, to a decrease in the global traffic throughout.

For ballistic annihilation, dimensional analysis shows that the concentration and root means square velocity decay as c similar to l(-alpha) and upsilon similar to l(-beta), respectively, with alpha + beta = 1 in any spatial dimension. Analysis of the Boltzmann equation for the evolution of the velocity distribution predicts alpha = (2 + 2 mu)/(3 + 2 mu) and beta = 1/(3 + 2 mu) for an initial velocity distribution P(upsilon,t=0) similar to upsilon(mu) as upsilon --> 0. New phenomena associated with discrete initial velocity distributions and with mixed ballistic and diffusive reactant motion are also discussed. In the aggregation process, each ''car'' moves at its initial velocity until the preceding car or cluster is overtaken after which the incident car assumes the velocity of the cluster which it has just joined. For P-0(upsilon) similar to upsilon(mu) as upsilon --> 0, the average cluster size grows as n similar to t((mu+1)/(mu+2)) and the average velocity decays as upsilon similar to t(-1/(mu+2)). We also derive an asymptotic expression for the joint distribution function for the cluster mass and velocity.

The effect of a crosscut road on the traffic flow is investigated by the use of a computer simulation. The traffic jam appears when a shock (discontinuous interface of different car densities) is formed. The condition for shock formation is derived for car densities p(y) and p(x) of the crosscut road and its crossing streets. The phase diagram and the dependence of the traffic flow on the car densities are shown. Also, we study the shock structure and the scaling of its width. The width DELTAw of the shock scales with the system size L as DELTAw almost-equal-to L1/2. We present a self-consistent mean-field theory for the traffic flow.

J	RIEDEL, T; BRUNNER, U				RIEDEL, T; BRUNNER, U			TRAFFIC CONTROL USING GRAPH-THEORY	CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE			English	Article						DISCRETE EVENT SYSTEMS; TRAFFIC CONTROL; GRAPH THEORY; DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING		In this paper the design of a controller for a traffic crossing is presented by means of an example. The controller to be developed has to minimise the waiting time of the public transportation while maintaining the individual traffic flowing as well as possible. First, the model of the chosen traffic crossing is derived. Then, using a combination of 'Dynamic Programming' and 'Branch and Bound' the control algorithm is presented. A visualisation of the algorithm is given by means of graphs, complexity issues are investigated, and computational refinements proposed. Simulation results are shown at the end. The actual implementation of the control algorithm for the example shown is under way and carried out in co-operation with the Transportation Authority of the city of Zurich. The work presented here is part of a bigger project. The overall goal is to provide the traffic engineer with a tool for designing 'intelligent' controllers for traffic lights.

The model shows emergent traffic jams with a self-similar appearance near the throughput maximum of the traffic. The lifetime distribution of these jams shows a short scaling regime, which gets considerably longer if one reduces the fluctuations when driving at maximum speed but leaves the fluctuations for slowing down or accelerating unchanged. The outflow from a traffic jam self-organizes into this state of maximum throughput.		NAGEL, K (corresponding author), UNIV COLOGNE, INST MATH, ZENTRUM PARALLELES RECH, D-50923 COLOGNE, GERMANY.

Using information from the Queen Elizabeth Way Freeway Traffic Management System (QEW FTMS), near Toronto, Ontario, Canada, it shows that catastrophe theory can be effectively applied to traffic flow. Following previous work done by Navin (1986) and Hall and others (1987; Dillon & Hall, 1988; Persaud & Hall, 1989; Forbes & Hall, 1990), this paper demonstrates how a transformation of variables and axes, including translation and rotation of the axes, is able to provide a good fit for a catastrophe theory model to traffic data. The paper also describes the criteria for the selection of the position of a new origin and the determination of the angle for rotating the axes.

J	CAREY, M; SRINIVASAN, A				CAREY, M; SRINIVASAN, A			SOLVING A CLASS OF NETWORK MODELS FOR DYNAMIC FLOW-CONTROL	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						NETWORKS; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSPORTATION; TRAFFIC FLOWS		In modeling flows and controls in transportation, distribution, communication, manufacturing systems, etc., it is often convenient to represent the system as a store-and-forward network. In such networks it is common for time, space, attention, or other resources, to be shared between sets of neighbouring nodes. For example, neighbouring nodes may share storage space, machine time, operating time, etc. The allocation of this shared resource among nodes determines a set of 'controls' on the network arc flows. We develop a multi-period network model which describes such storage and forwarding, and the sharing of resources (controls) between subsets of nodes. To solve the model we develop algorithms which take advantage of the embedded network structure of the problem. Each of the algorithms is based on iterating between (a) solving a least-cost capacitated network flow problem with fixed capacities (controls) and (b) solving a set of simple small scale problems to update these controls. In a series of computational experiments we found that an ('unoptimized') implementation of the algorithms performed between 13 and 42 times faster than a good linear programming code, which is the natural alternative. Also, by decomposing the problem, the algorithms make solving larger scale problems tractable, and are suitable for implementation on parallel processors.

Two new high-order continuum traffic flow formulations are developed for treating congested flows and complex geometrics such as entrance and exit ramps. The acceleration and inertia effects of the traffic mass are properly addressed in the new formulations. Traffic friction due to lane changing at freeway/ramp junction is also treated through the use of a friction term in the first formulation and a viscosity term in the second. The new models do not require the use of an equilibrium speed-density relationship, and thus they require less calibration effort in field applications. Satisfactory results are obtained when the models are tested in situations involving pipeline freeways, entrance ramps, and exit ramps. Field data from both loop detectors and video detectors are used. These tests suggest that the new models are capable of describing traffic dynamics at various traffic conditions and changing geometrics.

This paper reports an application of CDAM to the central Kowloon study area in Hong Kong. The coefficients of the model related to the components of generalized costs are calibrated on 1986 travel data. A comparison of results of CDAM and a version of MicroTRIPS models of transportation demand in Hong Kong are presented. Finally, some conclusions are drawn and the advantage of the CDAM are discussed.

We study the traffic flow of the system when the translation invariance is broken by the insertion of a blockage which is induced by a car accident in the first lane. Using the computer simulation, it is shown that the dynamical jamming transitions occur successively from phase 1 to phase 4 with increasing the density of cars. In phase 1, no cars exist in the first lane and the cars in the second lane move with the maximal velocity. In phase 2, a discontinuity of the traffic-flow pattern appears and the cars move with the maximal current. Its discontinuity segregates system into two regions with different densities. In phase 3, the discontinuity disappears. In phase 4, the cars do not move ahead but vibrate between the first and second lanes.

So, the random noise fluctuations usually exhibit periodic nonstationary properties caused by the periodic temporal change of traffic flow. Also, statistical parameters such as the equivalent sound level (L(eq)) and the median value of sound level (L50) are important for noise evaluation and regulation problems. In this paper, a new approximate probability density function (pdf) of nonstationary noise level fluctuation is proposed in a case where the road traffic flow is controlled by traffic signals, by paying special attention to the periodicity of fluctuation patterns of the cumulant statistics of noise level Next, the explicit expressions of L(eq) and L50 are derived as an application of the above theory. The effects of the nonstationary properties caused by the traffic signals on the noise evaluation indices, L(eq) and L50, are shown quantitatively. Finally, statistical evaluation methods for the dispersion of L(eq) and L50 estimations caused by the finiteness of the sample sizes are theoretically considered, in a case when L(eq) and L50 for the periodic nonstationary road traffic noise are experimentally estimated by using the usual sound level meter and sampling method.

The CA model is an extended version of the one-dimensional asymmetric exclusion model to take into account the stochastic exchange of cars between the first and second lanes. We study the traffic how of the system when the translation invariance is broken by the insertion of a blockage which is induced by a car accident on the first lane. Using the computer simulation, it is found that the dynamical jamming transions occur successively from the phase 1, through the phase 2, to the phase 3 with increasing the density of cars. The phase 1 is characterized by the property such that no cars exist in the first lane and the cars on the second lane move with the maximal velocity. The phase 2 is characterized by the shock formation (a discontinuity of density) and the maximal current. In the phase 3, the discontinuity disappears and the traffic flow is not affected by the car accident.

J	NAGEL, K; SCHLEICHER, A				NAGEL, K; SCHLEICHER, A			PRACTICAL ASPECTS AND EXPERIENCES - MICROSCOPIC TRAFFIC MODELING ON PARALLEL HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTERS	PARALLEL COMPUTING			English	Article						TRAFFIC MODELING; MICROSCOPIC TRAFFIC SIMULATION; DISTRIBUTED MEMORY MULTIPROCESSOR; VECTOR COMPUTER; TRANSPUTER; WORKSTATION CLUSTER; PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS	FLOW	A simple, rule-based approach to traffic flow can yield astonishingly realistic results and is therefore a candidate for very fast large scale microscopic traffic simulations. In the present article, we evaluate two conceptually different codings of the same dynamics on parallel supercomputers. We use a Parsytec GCel-3 (1024 nodes), an Intel iPSC/860 (32 nodes), and a Connection Machine CM-5 (32 nodes). For comparison purposes, we use as well a NEC-SX3/11 traditional single node vector computer, and a net of coupled workstations. Compared to published computing speeds of microscopic traffic models, our model proves to be up to about 1000 times faster. We find our highest computing speed by employing a single-bit coding scheme used in, e.g., Ising-model programming. As traffic flow is a one-dimensional problem, a complication is that geometric parallelization has to be done in the same direction as single-bit coding. Nevertheless, we reach efficiencies near 100 percent for large systems. We use these computational resources in order to obtain high quality data of the model's average behavior (fundamental diagrams).

J	IOANNOU, PA; CHIEN, CC				IOANNOU, PA; CHIEN, CC			AUTONOMOUS INTELLIGENT CRUISE CONTROL	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article								Vehicle following and its effects on traffic flow has been an active area of research. Human driving involves reaction times, delays, and human errors that affect traffic flow adversely. One way to eliminate human errors and delays in vehicle following is to replace the human driver with a computer control system and sensors. The purpose of this paper is to develop an autonomous intelligent cruise control (AICC) system for automatic vehicle following, examine its effect on traffic flow, and compare its performance with that of the human driver models. The AICC system developed is not cooperative; i.e., it does not exchange information with other vehicles and yet is not susceptible to oscillations and ''slinky'' effects. The elimination of the ''slinky'' effect is achieved by using a safety distance separation rule that is proportional to the vehicle velocity (constant time headway) and by designing the control system appropriately. The performance of the AICC system is found to be superior to that of the human driver models considered. It has a faster and better transient response that leads to a much smoother and faster traffic flow. Computer simulations are used to study the performance of the proposed AICC system and analyze vehicle following in a single lane, without passing, under manual and automatic control, In addition, several emergency situations that include emergency stopping and cut-in cases were simulated. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the AICC system and its potentially beneficial effects on traffic flow.

The CA model is an extended version of the one-dimensional asymmetric simple-exclusion model taking into account the variation of car velocity which depends on the distance between a car and the car ahead. Using computer simulation, it is found that clustering (or aggregation) of cars occurs in our model. The mean distance [l] between cars scales as [l] almost-equal-to t0.37 +/- 0.02 where t is time. Similarly, the mean cluster size [s] of cars scales as [s] almost-equal-to t0.37 +/- 0.02. It is shown that the cumulative cluster-size distribution N(s) is not a power-law type but an exponential function N(s) almost-equal-to [s]-1 e-1.72s/[s].

J	ZHANG, JP				ZHANG, JP			A STUDY ON THE HIGHWAY NOISE PREDICTION MODEL APPLICABLE TO DIFFERENT TRAFFIC FLOW	NOISE CONTROL ENGINEERING JOURNAL			English	Article								The motion of the vehicles on a one-way, two-lane road is described with a continuous distribution of traffic flow; meanwhile, a new method of calculating the highway noise levels with freely flowing traffic and ''jammed'' heavy traffic flow is suggested on the basis of probability theory, considering the background environmental noise. From tests the calculated values are seen to agree well with the measurements on some main roads in Hangzhou and Shanghai, China. In order to overcome the limitations of many other highway noise prediction models, a new one was developed that is better able to describe traffic using the united negative exponential distribution. Applications of the method to different traffic conditions is discussed.

The purpose of this article is to show that the R2 values obtained in different studies are rarely comparable with each other and that a prediction model can be ''nearly perfect'' even if the coefficient of determination is small. Another purpose of the article is to present some results of interest from a practical viewpoint in regard to accidents where pedestrians and cyclists are involved. Empirical R2 values for models predicting accidents at junctions where pedestrians or cyclists are involved are compared with the maximal R2 values that could possibly be obtained. The latter can be calculated both theoretically and with the aid of simulation. How the maximal R2 value depends on the average accident level and the relative dispersion of the expected values for the studied junctions is also shown theoretically. The results obtained show how difficult it can be to determine whether and how far the number of accidents is influenced by additional factors, over and above the traffic flows, which describe the design in greater detail.

The effect of a stagnant street on the dynamical jamming transition is investigated by the use of a computer simulation. The jamming transition describes the boundary between the moving phase in which cars are moving and the jamming phase in which all cars are stopped. It is shown that the jamming transition occurs at a lower total density of cars with an increasing local density of cars in the stagnant street.

J	DAVIS, GA				DAVIS, GA			ESTIMATING FREEWAY DEMAND PATTERNS AND IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTY ON RAMP CONTROLS	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								An important application of advanced technology to transportation engineering involves the development of advanced traffic management systems (ATMS). Any proposed traffic-management action is essentially a forecast that the action will cause certain conditions, and uncertainty concerning traffic demand and/or the values of model parameters will introduce random error between what is expected and what actually occurs. This paper considers in some detail the problem of forecasting whether or not a given set of freeway on-ramp volumes are likely to cause overcapacity mainline demand. A simple model for the distribution of freeway traffic is considered, which leads to a straightforward interpretation of the impact of forecast uncertainty as a reduction in practial mainline capacity. The problem of efficient estimation-of-demand model parameters is then taken up; by embedding the demand model in a Markov-process model of freeway traffic flow, it becomes possible to compare three estimation approaches via Monte Carlo methods. These estimators show noticeable differences in statistical efficiency, which translate into practically significant differences in freeway mainline capacity. This suggests that improvements in traffic management may be possible through substitution of efficient for less-efficient statistical procedures.

Optimal ramp-metering control lies at the center of such a hierarchical control system. However, current ramp-metering control strategies are not truly dynamic, are not optimal, or consider only parts of the freeway corridor. This paper presents an optimal ramp-metering control method to alleviate congestion in the interacting corridor components, including freeway, parallel arterials, and connecting streets. The control formulation employs a continuum traffic-flow model of the corridor dynamics, and the conjugate gradient method to search for optimal ramp-metering rates according to the total travel time in the corridor. A test of the optimal metering for a simple one-ramp segment of a freeway corridor is presented.

The goal of any incident-management program is the minimization of incident delay through the rapid restoration of the freeway capacity. The most important aspect of freeway-incident management is the servicing and the removal of the incidents. Currently a number of FIM programs use a fleet of trucks for the quick restoration of freeway capacity. Although the deployment of these traffic-flow restoration units (TFRUs) is an important component of freeway-management operations, the literature lacks analytical models that can be used to rationalize the deployment of the TFRUs. The present paper proposes an integrated methodological framework for the minimization of freeway-incident delays through the optimum deployment of TFRUs. The proposed model consists of three basic modules. The first module determines the number of required TFRUs and their service territories. The second module simulates the generation of freeway incidents and the traffic-flow restoration operations to estimate the total incident clearance time for each incident. Finally, the third module estimates the freeway-incident delay based on the total incident clearance time and the geometric and traffic characteristics of the freeway under study. The proposed model can be used to determine the number of TFRUs, and their dispatch policy, to achieve a threshold value of freeway-incident delay.

Hourly mean emissions for February 1990 are presented. For the same period, measurements of NO as well as meteorological measurements were taken at and close to the motorway. A long path instrument, based on the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) principles was used for gas measurements in the ambient air. An atmospheric diffusion model was used in order to determine the traffic emissions that fully explained the concentration of the gas measured in the ambient air. Emission estimates based on these principles are presented as hourly values for an average day during February 1990. The emission estimates from the two mutually independent methods show striking similarities. It is concluded that a further developed model based on DOAS measurements, could be a flexible and cost effective method for the estimation of traffic emissions, for several gases and for complex traffic scenarios, implying new and better ways of comparing the environmental effects of different approaches to traffic planning solutions and infrastructural design.

Traffic delays are likely to increase substantially over the next fifteen to twenty years as the trans-mountain highway system undergoes major reconstruction. This paper presents a model to estimate the delay to vehicular traffic under controlled conditions, such as highway reconstruction and avalanche stabilization. The main model inputs are traffic flow rate, duration of closure, traffic composition, and vehicular occupancy. A numerical example is presented to illustrate how the model can be used to estimate total delay and the economic cost of delay.

The signal controllers in ARTC are interconnected through a computer network. By exchanging traffic flow information among the signal controllers, ARTC provides a new concept in areawide traffic control. With a global view of the traffic in the area, ARTC anticipates congestion. Simulation results of the ARTC prototype control algorithm over a linear road topology is also presented, and the results show significant improvement over an optimized fixed time control. The signal controllers and the computer network are designed to support the real-time communication requirements and a sufficient level of fault-tolerance.

The INTRAS microscopic simulation model was calibrated and validated using empirical data collected at a weaving site. Increasing traffic demands were then sequentially input into repeated simulation runs to identify the boundary between uncongested and congested operation. Where a weaving section exhibits a typical level of both merging and diverging traffic movements, capacity is defined as a function of flows and lane-changing rates occurring in the vicinity of the weaving area's merge gore. Where a weaving section operates with a relatively low total weaving demand, capacity is defined as a maximum rate of vehicles per lane. Validation experiments described in this paper suggest that the derived values of capacity apply to any one-sided freeway weaving section.

We studied and implemented explicit and implicit numerical methods for solving high-order flow conservation traffic models. The acceleration and inertia effects of the traffic mass are properly addressed in the new formulations. The high order model does not employ equilibrium flow-density relationships. We wrote an experimental code in C to simulate a freeway (un)congested pipeline and freeway entry/exit traffic flow. Tests with real data collected from the 1-35 W freeway in Minneapolis were conducted on a workstation computer. The implicit Euler method gave the same (and in some cases better) accuracy as the explicit Lax method. The implicit Euler method was (about three times) faster than the Lax method.

Each vehicle in the string is equipped with automatic velocity control, and is linked to the vehicles next to it by a local digital communication system. The vehicles travel close together in the string, and longitudinal control is achieved using a PD control algorithm cast in the form of a pole assignment problem. The algorithm requires that control signals, and position and velocity data for each vehicle be transmitted to the following vehicle. It can be shown that one-way communication is sufficient to provide the required degree of control. Simulations were performed to compare the vehicle following performance of the system to that achieved by human drivers. The simulations showed that the system prevents the traffic flow instabilities and rear-end collisions that tend to occur in a string with human drivers when the lead vehicle brakes suddenly. Longitudinal control using vehicle-to-vehicle communication therefore has the potential to increase road capacity and avoid the traffic delays that are inevitable with human drivers.									0	0	0	0	2	MECHANICAL ENGINEERING LAB	IBARAKI	AGENCY INDUSTRIAL SCI TECHNOL NAMIKI1-2, TSUKUBA, IBARAKI 305, JAPAN	0388-4252			J MECH ENG LAB	J.

J	SMITH, MJ				SMITH, MJ			A NEW DYNAMIC TRAFFIC MODEL AND THE EXISTENCE AND CALCULATION OF DYNAMIC USER EQUILIBRIA ON CONGESTED CAPACITY-CONSTRAINED ROAD NETWORKS	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							ASSIGNMENT; STABILITY	This paper presents a new dynamic model of peak period traffic flows on congested capacity-constrained urban road networks. While respecting the first in, first out (FIFO) discipline of road traffic queues and the exit capacities of road links, the model determines the (time-varying) costs incurred in traversing the various routes when (time-varying) route inflows are specified. It is proved that if this model is used to find route costs then a dynamic user equilibrium exists. The paper also gives four optimisation formulations of the dynamic user equilibrium problem. A descent algorithm is suggested; there is, as yet, no proof that the algorithm converges to an equilibrium. Finally, the paper introduces a family of alternative methods of determining dynamic flows which (almost) satisfy FIFO, and specifies one member of this family in some detail. These alternative methods arise as a consequence of using different ways of specifying the priority of a vehicle or a group of vehicles.

J	RAN, B; BOYCE, DE; LEBLANC, LJ				RAN, B; BOYCE, DE; LEBLANC, LJ			A NEW CLASS OF INSTANTANEOUS DYNAMIC USER-OPTIMAL TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT MODELS	OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article							TIME; NETWORKS	The instantaneous dynamic user-optimal (DUO) traffic assignment problem is to determine vehicle flows on each link at each instant of time resulting from drivers using instantaneous minimal-time routes. Instantaneous route time is the travel time incurred if traffic conditions remain unchanged while driving along the route. In this paper, we introduce a different definition of an instantaneous DUO state. Using the optimal control theory approach, we formulate two new DUO traffic assignment models for a congested transportation network. These models include new formulations of the objective function and flow propagation constraints, and are dynamic generalizations of the static user-optimal model. The equivalence of the solutions of the two optimal control programs with DUO traffic flows is demonstrated by proving the equivalence of the first-order necessary conditions of the two programs with the instantaneous DUO conditions. Since these optimal control problems are convex programs with linear constraints, they have unique solutions. A numerical example is presented indicating that this class of models yields realistic results.

J	SMART, R				SMART, R			LAYOUT - FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-CIVIL ENGINEERING			English	Article								The UK terminal design encompassed overall co-ordination of the site layout, earthworks, infrastructure, landscape planning and designing the buildings and structures. The primary influence on the development of the UK terminal site is the design of the rail system in the context and constraints of the site geology, geography and environment. The fact that the English site is long and narrow-only a quarter of the size of the French site at Sangatte-influenced most of the functional layout and development. The clarity of routes was a key objective which emerged after a long process of refinement. A wide range of estimated traffic flows in volume and mix was forecast and related to transaction times. Sophisticated modelling was used to design the whole system to relate traffic flows to anticipated railway operating timetables. As a huge road-rail interchange the UK terminal design had to respect its setting, being in an area of outstanding natural beauty. The landscaping strategy was crucial. The design strategy for the terminal sought to marry the natural context with the dominant engineering structures, yet moderate the scale so that they did not overwhelm the smaller elements. A site geometry was developed, based on a series of relationships between the structures and the infrastructure. Related grids provide a hidden basis for co-ordinating roads, lighting, landscape and signs. The aim for the UK terminal was to create an integrated design-the whole being greater than the sum of the parts.									0	0	0	1	2	THOMAS TELFORD SERVICES LTD	LONDON	THOMAS TELFORD HOUSE, 1 HERON QUAY, LONDON, ENGLAND E14 4JD	0965-089X			P I CIVIL ENG-CIV EN	Proc.

For the case that sigma is a multiplication operator we prove the weak convergence of solutions of a stochastic heat equation on the interval [-m, m] to the solution of the corresponding equation on the whole real line as m --> infinity. For the case that sigma is a particular operator (depending only on m) we show convergence of the solutions to a stationary Gaussian limit process that can serve as model of stationary freeway traffic flow.

J	VAUGHAN, R; HURDLE, VF				VAUGHAN, R; HURDLE, VF			A THEORY OF TRAFFIC FLOW FOR CONGESTED CONDITIONS ON URBAN ARTERIAL STREETS .1. THEORETICAL DEVELOPMENT	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								In an earlier paper, Vaughan, Hurdle and Hauer posed a time-dependent traffic flow problem in which travellers go home from work on a long arterial street. Each traveller enters the street at a particular time and place, bound for some given destination as prescribed by a continuous trip density function, but the time at which his or her trip is completed depends on the traffic conditions en route; hence on the origins, destinations, and departure times of other motorists. A solution was obtained, but a solution that is valid only if no intersection becomes saturated. In this paper, the analysis is extended to cover cases where some key intersection does become saturated. The model is macroscopic and differs from alternative models of traffic flow in two ways. The first and more important is that the impact of the origin destination pattern on the traffic dynamics and vice versa are explicitly recognized and included in the model. This is particularly important when the impact of exit flows on downstream facilities is an issue and in applications involving route choice or elastic demand, since it allows choices based on the travel times that would be experienced by the travellers actually making the decisions. The second difference is that it is explicitly a queueing model: the basic assumption is that intersections along the roadway have capacities and that when the capacity of some key intersection is exceeded by the arrival flow, the large queue that results will be the dominant element controlling subsequent operation of the system.

J	HURDLE, VF				HURDLE, VF			A THEORY OF TRAFFIC FLOW FOR CONGESTED CONDITIONS ON URBAN ARTERIAL STREETS .2. 4 ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLES	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article							INVESTMENT	The accompanying theoretical paper by Vaughan and Hurdle proposes an analytical model for simulating traffic conditions along a badly congested arterial street; this paper illustrates the theory by means of four example problems. The examples are all set on the same street, but the time-varying origin-destination patterns differ. The first pattern is deliberately very simple so that the results can be compared to what one would expect. The second is a slightly more complex loading which can be thought of as a disaster evacuation scenario. The third is an idealized journey-from-work scenario and the last is a modified version of the third example in which demand is elastic. These last two examples illustrate the power to deal with dynamic phenomena that the model gains by solving problems in a work space defined by location and trajectory-label axes rather than the usual time-space plane.

Knowledge of the delay and queueing processes of minor road vehicles at such intersections is important for the decision making of traffic planners. Stochastic models of the processes at these types of intersections have been progressing incrementally, taking more realistic and complex interactions into account. Renewal-reward and Markov chain models have been used extensively in these models. Time dependency of traffic flow has also been taken into consideration, through discrete approximations and other simplifications. Although some field data verifications of the models have been performed, more intensive field data collection and analysis could prove useful in defining and extending the range of usefulness of these models.

First, a headway distribution of the nonstationary traffic flow passing through within a road segment is proposed on the basis of an Erlang distribution by reflecting a temporal change of its distribution parameters. Then, an initial phase density concerning with asynchronous counting method and the probability of counting n cars over a long time interval are derived from the above nonstationary expression of headway distribution. Thus, the statistics of noise intensity at an observation point has been predicted by combining the above probabilistic factors and deterministic factors related to noise propagation environment with use of a compound stochastic process model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed theory has been confirmed experimentally by applying it to the actual traffic flow on a highway.

J	GAZIS, DC; HERMAN, R				GAZIS, DC; HERMAN, R			THE MOVING AND PHANTOM BOTTLENECKS	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article								When a slow-moving vehicle occupies one of the lanes of a multilane highway, it often causes queueing behind it, not unlike one caused by an actual stoppage on that lane. This happens when the traffic flow rate upstream from the slow vehicle exceeds a certain critical value. We define this situation as the case of the Moving Bottleneck. There are other situations when people caught in a traffic jam slowly advance to the point of a suspected breakdown or other obstruction, only to find out that no such obstruction exists but suddenly the flow of traffic is free and rapid. We define this situation as that of the Phantom Bottleneck. We present a model describing these two situations on the basis of reasonable assumptions about the behavior of drivers whose movement is obstructed by the slow vehicle. Using a phenomenological relationship between flow and concentration, we derive formulas describing the behavior of the moving queue caused by the obstruction. Finally, we suggest procedures for validating the model and using it for a rational approach to the design of allowable minimum speeds on highways.

A key step in this model is the estimation of average speed. These speed equations are the focus of the research on which this paper is based. The University of New Brunswick (UNB) recently completed a research project funded by Transport Canada and the New Brunswick Department of Transportation on the factors that influence highway speed. The purpose of the study was to develop speed equations for the Province of New Brunswick which could be incorporated into HUBAM. As part of the research, this paper evaluated the accuracy of the default equations in HUBAM relating speed and flow rate. An analysis of the speed and traffic flow data indicated that HUBAM underestimates speed for New Brunswick conditions. The low estimates appear to result from the curves of speed versus volume to capacity. It was concluded that regression equations developed by UNB should provide more realistic results, since the UNB equations provide a superior estimate of the observed field data.

The model is a simplified version of a shockwave model for the case where passing is restricted. The main inputs of the model consist of traffic volume and speed of both the traffice stream and the slow-moving vehicle. Model outputs include queue length and vehicular delay for a specific traffic flow and distance over which passing is restricted. The slow-moving-vehicle model was used to estimate vehicular delay and queue-length buildup for a proposed system of truck turnouts on a two-lane highway during the movement of large overdimensional loads. The paper includes a description of the truck-turnout system on the high-wide-load corridor in northern Alberta, Canada. The slow-moving-vehicle model could also be used to develop a system of turnouts along two-lane highways, which would limit vehicular delays and queue length to acceptable levels.

Tests with real data collected from the I-35 W freeway in Minneapolis were conducted on a workstation computer. The implicit methods gave the same (and in some cases better) accuracy as the Lax method. The implicit methods were (more than twice) faster than the Lax method.

J	WEITS, E				WEITS, E			STATIONARY FREEWAY TRAFFIC FLOW MODELED BY A LINEAR STOCHASTIC PARTIAL-DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								A stochastic model of stationary high density freeway traffic flow is presented. The high density assumption implies the choice of a macroscopic model. The assumption of stationarity allows us to linearize the model equations, but at the same time leads us to adding an appropriate stochastic term to the equation obtained from linearizing the original equations. The result is an infinite-dimensional stochastic differential equation describing the evolution of R(t,x). R(t,x) is the deviation of the density around some fixed value at time t and location x. R(t,x) is a stationary Gaussian process, if the initial value is suitably chosen. The process R(t,x) is determined by three parameters. Knowledge of these parameters may enable the traffic engineer to characterize the traffic stream as homogeneous or inhomogeneous. The model is tested with data measured on a Dutch freeway.

J	CAREY, M				CAREY, M			NONCONVEXITY OF THE DYNAMIC TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT PROBLEM	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article								We identify and discuss what appears to be a central difficulty for the future development of models of dynamic traffic flows on road networks. This difficulty is due to the fact that road traffic tends to behave in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner: that is, traffic which embarks on a road or other facility in period t exits from that facility ("on average") before traffic which enters in any later time periods. The FIFO requirement does not cause a problem in static traffic assignment, but we show that it yields a nonconvex constraint set in dynamic assignment, especially if there are multiple destinations or commodities. We consider various formulations, each of which yields a nonconvex optimization problem which is at present computationally tractable only for relatively small-scale examples. The above FIFO problem arises even if there is no congestion, and even if travel demands are fixed. Further the problem arises whether we are modeling a system optimum or a user equilibrium, and whether we use an optimization formulation or a complementarity or variational inequality formulation. We make some suggestions for dealing with, or avoiding, the problem and for further research.		CAREY, M (corresponding author), UNIV ULSTER,FAC BUSINESS,BELFAST BT37 0QB,NORTH IRELAND.

J	CUENA, J				CUENA, J			INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS FOR TRAFFIC FLOW MANAGEMENT - A QUALITATIVE MODELING APPROACH	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article								An approach for the design of intelligent systems for traffic control is presented. First, the problem characteristics are described. Then, the possible knowledge representation techniques are proposed. The types of knowledge to be represented are: The data interpretation knowledge for problem identification based on the present and predicted situations. The knowledge for proposing control decisions to solve present and predicted problems. The knowledge for possible short-term situations prediction with the present control policy assumed as constant. The first two types can be represented by traditional techniques such as rules or frames. The predictive knowledge has to be defined on qualitative modeling techniques, an aspect of intensive research nowadays. Two types of predictive modeling techniques are suggested: (a) The qualitative simulation of flow along an axis which is the case of the flow in urban motorways where it is very important the preservation of an operational capacity. A confluence version is proposed for the partial derivative equations of unsteady traffic flow in a lane. (b) The qualitative modeling of the flow in networks where a qualitative version of the flow assignment to paths in the network is used. A proposal of knowledge representation for every prediction type is described. Although specific aspects of traffic control are presented the approach discussed can be considered as a general knowledge representation concept which combines traditional techniques and qualitative models in order to infer decision aspects for management purposes in a professional engineering domain. Finally, some knowledge structuring and acquisition aspects are considered.		CUENA, J (corresponding author), UNIV POLITECN MADRID,FAC INFORMAT,DEPT INTELIGENCIA ARTIFICIAL,E-28660 MADRID,SPAIN.

Many of these differences are now changing rapidly. Part two analyses the effects of the high-speed train, using the example of the Federal Republic of Germany. This technology generates a new level of locational quality and above all benefits high-ranking urban agglomerations which are already well supplied with the traditional transport systems. In Part three the situation in Eastern Europe is considered where a system of lower technological standard gains importance at least in the near future: freight traffic shifts more and more to the road network while the railways are losing their leading position. ''Accessibility in road transport'' and ''freight traffic potential'' are calculated for 820 European regions. The regional distribution of these indicators shows the actual deficits of Eastern Europe. Simulations of the planned road network extensions in the Western and Eastern states give impressions of the future improvements in locational quality.

It reviews the general theoretical case for such pricing and summarizes recent international interest in congestion pricing. Next, it sets forth the reasons why demonstration projects are needed, both to add to our knowledge about how effective congestion pricing may prove to be, and to address political and other public-acceptance barriers to implementation of the concept. The paper then defines a specific proposed test site for congestion pricing: a new toll road being planned for Orange County, California. It is proposed that instead of charging flat-rate tolls, the transportation agency could charge peak and off-peak tolls, increasing the level of the peak charge each year over a period of up to 10 years unless or until toll revenues decline below the levels forecast under the flat-rate toll alternative. Measurements of traffic flow and ride-sharing behavior would be made, as well as calculations of emission-reduction effects. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of marketing and political considerations involved in conducting such a demonstration.

The data available for analyses were collected from two test sites using a time-elapsed video recorder. It has been found that traffic flow variables, such as the headway mean and variance, speed, and density ratios between neighboring lanes, are highly correlated with the fraction and frequency of vehicles changing lanes. The results of exploratory analyses are further examined with two generalized linear models. The logistic and Poisson regressions are used respectively for constructing the lane-changing fraction and frequency models. With maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) both models provide consistent information and achieve a reasonable goodness of fit.

In this paper, differing from the previous methods, a new trial of the prediction in a hybrid type of the above contrasting view points has been proposed in a unified prediction form, with flexible applicability to arbitrary types of the vehicles situation and the sound propagation environment, by introducing hierarchically a unified traffic flow model based on a well-known standard Poison type of flow. Finally, the effectiveness of the present prediction method has been experimentally confirmed by applying it to data actually observed on road traffic noise and ground vibration.

This paper presents the findings of a recently completed study of the Trans-Canada Highway through Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Park. The study method is based on the fact that traffic flow characteristics, highway conditions, and operational requirements vary considerably from season to season. Thus, the analysis was broken into two parts, namely a separate analysis of winter and summer conditions. A traffic simulation model was used to determine those locations that could serve as potential sites for passing lanes during summer. The traffic simulation model developed for the passing lane analysis utilized files that describe road geometry, summer traffic flow and composition, and vehicle performance. A separate simulation model was developed to determine vehicle storage requirements of ponding areas during avalanche control. The model developed for winter traffic characteristics also provided the basis for a flexible traffic management strategy. Cross-section elements were developed to accommodate an auxiliary lane to be used as a passing lane in summer and as a parking lane to increase the capacity of ponding areas during avalanche control in winter. Design requirements called for triple stacking of vehicles in ponding areas during avalanche control. To accommodate design year traffic volumes at an acceptable level of service during the summer months, 12 passing lanes totalling 23 km in length were recommended. Six ponding areas, totalling 4 km in length, are coincident with four of the passing lane locations. The paper concludes with a general discussion on the benefits of linking traffic simulation with geometric design to demonstrate how the design life of rural two-lane highways can be extended by the use of low-cost operational improvements such as passing lanes.

Under such a scheme a continuous green band of uniform width is provided in each direction along the artery at the desired speed of travel. A basic limitation of existing bandwidth-based programs is that they do not consider the actual traffic volumes and flow capacities on each link in their optimization criterion. Consequently they cannot guarantee the most suitable progression scheme for different traffic flow patterns. In this paper we present a new optimization approach for arterial progression that incorporates a systematic traffic-dependent criterion. The method generates a variable bandwidth progression in which each directional road section can obtain an individually weighted bandwidth (hence, the term multi-band). Mixed-integer linear programming is used for the optimization. Simulation results indicate that this method can produce considerable gains in performance when compared with traditional progression methods. It also lends itself to a natural extension for the optimization of grid networks.

The local micrometeorological parameters were measured by an automatic monitoring network; traffic flows and speed were evaluated through a traffic assignment model; motor vehicle composition and hourly distribution throughout the day were determined by the Milan Urban Police measurements; the emission factors were estimated from R. Joumard's experimental data. The calculated hourly concentrations of CO and NOx for the average day were compared with those measured at six points for two months, June and September 1989. The normalized mean-square errors obtained for the monthly average hourly concentrations were generally below 0.2 and for monthly average concentrations were below 0.1. The results of the comparison between calculated and measured concentrations suggested the use of APRAC3 for air quality analysis in urban transportation planning in Milan.
