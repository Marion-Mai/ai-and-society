Yet, current automated solutions leave existing human controllers "out of the loop" rendering the potential solutions both technically dangerous (e.g. inability to react to suddenly developing conditions) and politically charged (e.g. role of air traffic controllers in a fully automated system). Instead, this paper outlines a distributed agent-based solution where agents provide suggestions to human controllers. Though conceptually pleasing, this approach introduces two critical research issues. First, the agent actions are now filtered through interactions with other agents, human controllers and the environment before leading to a system state. This indirect action-to-effect process creates a complex learning problem. Second, even in the best case, not all air traffic controllers will be willing or able to follow the agents' suggestions. This partial participation effect will require the system to be robust to the number of controllers that follow the agent suggestions. In this paper, we present an agent reward structure that allows agents to learn good actions in this indirect environment, and explore the ability of those suggestion agents to achieve good system level performance. We present a series of experiments based on real historical air traffic data combined with simulation of air traffic flow around the New York city area. Results show that the agents can improve system-wide performance by up to 20% over that of human controllers alone, and that these results degrade gracefully when the number of human controllers that follow the agents' suggestions declines.

Phys. B 17 2366) which considered a diversity of traffic behaviors under real traffic situations induced by various driving characters and habits. In the new model, the effects of the velocity at the last time step and drivers' desire for acceleration are taken into account. The fundamental diagram, spatial-temporal diagram, and the time series of one-minute data are analyzed. The results show that this model reproduces synchronized flow. Finally, it simulates the on-ramp system with the proposed model. Some characteristics including the phase diagram are studied.

It consists of random walkers on a queuing network with one-range repulsion, where particles can be destroyed only if they can move. We focus on the dependence on the topology as well as on the level of traffic control. We are able to obtain transition curves and phase diagrams at an analytical level for the ensemble of uncorrelated networks and numerically for single instances. We find that traffic control improves global performance, enlarging the free-flow region in parameter space only in heterogeneous networks. Traffic control introduces non-linear effects and, beyond a critical strength, may trigger the appearance of a congested phase in a discontinuous manner. The model also reproduces the crossover in the scaling of traffic fluctuations empirically observed in the Internet, and moreover, a conserved version can reproduce qualitatively some stylized facts of traffic in transportation networks.

The method has been validated using microsimulations calibrated by in-situ measurements taken in the streets of the city of Santander (Cantabria, Spain). The analysis on the delays shows a good fit for the M/M/infinity model for flows of 60-70% of capacity where the error is always lower than 5%. This demonstrates the efficiency of the M/M/infinity model for studying how on-street parking maneuvers and badly parked vehicles influence traffic flow and avoids the need to use generally more laborious microsimulation models. Microsimulations are used to calculate the reduction in link capacity for each case in the study and the increases in average journey times for the rest of the road users. This shows the effect that allowing on-street parking on arterial or main roads has on the rest of the traffic.

J	Gao, K; Jiang, R; Wang, BH; Wu, QS				Gao, Kun; Jiang, Rui; Wang, Bing-Hong; Wu, Qing-Song			Discontinuous transition from free flow to synchronized flow induced by short-range interaction between vehicles in a three-phase traffic flow model	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Three-phase traffic flow; Breakdown phenomenon; Synchronized flow; Fundamental diagram	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; STATES; SIMULATION; HIGHWAY; DERIVATION; FEATURES; SYSTEMS; DIAGRAM; PHYSICS	In this paper, we incorporate a limitation on the interaction range between neighboring vehicles into the cellular automaton model proposed by Gao and Jiang et al. [K. Gao, R. Jiang, S. X. Hu, B. H. Wang and Q S. Wu, Phys. Rev. E 76 (2007) 026105], which was established within the framework of Kerner's three-phase traffic theory and has been shown to be able to reproduce the three-phase traffic flow. This modification eliminates an unrealistic phenomenon found in the previous model, where the velocity-adaptation effect between neighboring vehicles can exist even if those vehicles are infinitely far away from each other. Therefore, in the improved model, we regulate that such interactions can only occur within a finite distance. For simplicity, we suppose a constant value to describe this distance in this paper. As a result, when compared to the previous model, the improved model mainly simulates the following results which are believed to be an improvement. (1) The improved model successfully reproduces the expected discontinuous transition from free flow to synchronized flow and the related "moving synchronized flow pattern", which are both absent in the original model but have been observed in real traffic. (2) The improved model simulates the correlation functions, time headway distributions and optimal velocity functions which are all more consistent with the empirical data than the previous model and most of the other models published before. (3) Together with the previous two models considering the velocity-difference effect, this model finally accomplishes a significative process of developing traffic flow models from the traditional "fundamental diagram approach" to the three-phase traffic theory. This process should be helpful for us to understand the traffic dynamics and mechanics further and deeper. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our data originate from the German freeway A5 close to Frankfurt, i.e. from the same freeway section that has been the basis for the development of three-phase traffic theory. Despite of this, we end up with partially different interpretations of the observations. In particular, we highlight findings that are inconsistent with three-phase traffic theory and facts that question the concept of a "general pattern" of congested traffic flow. Finally, we discuss some open problems that call for the development of improved traffic models and further empirical studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Memory properties and fractional integration in transportation time-series	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Transportation; Time-series; ARIMA; GARCH; Fractional integration	URBAN TRAFFIC FLOW; LONG-MEMORY; UNIT-ROOT; AUTOREGRESSIVE MODELS; PREDICTION; NONLINEARITY; STATIONARITY; HYPOTHESIS; VOLUME	In transportation analyses, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models have been widely used mainly because of their well established theoretical foundation and ease of application. However, they lack the ability to capture long memory properties and do not jointly treat the mean and variance (variability) of a time-series. We employ fractionally integrated dual memory models and compare results to classical time-series models in a traffic engineering context. Results indicate that dual memory models offer better representation of the original time-series than classical models; further, forcing the differentiation parameter of ARIMA model to equal I leads to over-inflated moving average terms and, consequently, to questionable models with artificial correlation structures.

J	Barth, M; Boriboonsomsin, K				Barth, Matthew; Boriboonsomsin, Kanok			Energy and emissions impacts of a freeway-based dynamic eco-driving system	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Intelligent transportation systems; Telematics; Intelligent speed adaptation; Eco-driving		Surface transportation consumes a vast quantity of fuel and accounts for about a third of the US CO2 emissions. In addition to the use of more fuel-efficient vehicles and carbon-neutral alternative fuels, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions can be lowered through a variety of strategies that reduce congestion, smooth traffic flow, and reduce excessive vehicle speeds. Eco-driving is one such strategy. It typically consists of changing a person's driving behavior by providing general static advice to the driver (e.g. do not accelerate too quickly, reduce speeds, etc.). In this study, we investigate the concept of dynamic eco-driving, where advice is given in real-time to drivers changing traffic conditions in the vehicle's vicinity. This dynamic strategy takes advantage of real-time traffic sensing and telematics, allowing for a traffic management system to monitor traffic speed, density, and flow, and then communicates advice in real-time back to the vehicles. By providing dynamic advice to drivers, approximately 10-20% in fuel savings and lower CO2 emissions are possible without a significant increase in travel time. Based on simulations, it was found that in general, higher percentage reductions in fuel consumption and CO2 emission occur during severe compared to less congested scenarios. Real-world experiments have also been carried out, showing similar reductions but to a slightly smaller degree. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We extend the optimal velocity model to take into account the gravitational force which acts on vehicles as an external force. We study the traffic states and jamming transitions induced by the slope of highway. We derive the fundamental diagrams (flow-density diagrams) for the traffic flow on the sag, the uphill, and downhill by using the extended optimal velocity model. We clarify where and when traffic jams occur on a highway with gradients. We show the relationship between densities before and after the jam. We derive the dependence of the fundamental diagram on the slope of gradients. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Simulation results show that the traffic jam appears evidently at the intersection of the inner roundabout lane and the entering lane. The effect of the nonlinear reciprocity of the vehicle in the inner roundabout lane increases and the flux decreases with the increase of the deceleration probability. The flux of the system is improved by the increase of the turning probability.

The model considers the drivers adopting different driving rules under mutative traffic condition, and introduces the rules of driving method change. Numerical simulations have been carried out. The results show the complicated evolution process of traffic flow. Different values of change probability have different effect on mixed traffic flow. With the increase of change probability, aggressive vehicles cause greater effect. In the evolution process, the change frequency can be controlled by the definition of the change probability and safety probability. The traffic flow is higher in the new model than in the NS and SDNS model. This proves that the stop status of the whole traffic flow has been improved.

J	Helbing, D; Mazloumian, A				Helbing, D.; Mazloumian, A.			Operation regimes and slower-is-faster effect in the controlof traffic intersections	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							SELF-ORGANIZATION; FLOW; TRANSITION; MODEL; SIMULATION	The efficiency of traffic flows in urban areas is known to crucially depend on signal operation. Here, elements of signal control are discussed, based on the minimization of overall travel times or vehicle queues. Interestingly, we find different operation regimes, some of which involve a "slower-is-faster effect", where a delayed switching reduces the average travel times. These operation regimes characterize different ways of organizing traffic flows in urban road networks. Besides the optimize-one-phase approach, we discuss the procedure and advantages of optimizing multiple phases as well. To improve the service of vehicle platoons and support the self-organization of "green waves", it is proposed to consider the price of stopping newly arriving vehicles.

J	Hua, W; Zhou, FY; Chen, JH				Hua, Wei; Zhou, Feng-Yan; Chen, Jian-Hua			THE EFFECTS OF OFFSETTING AND WEDGING CELL LATTICES IN THE ON-RAMP SYSTEM	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Cellular automaton model; on-ramp; accelerating lane; virtual vehicle	MODEL	On-ramp is generally regarded as one of the key bottlenecks along the highway. In the present paper, three different merging relationships between on-ramp and main lane are analyzed and presented. The first case parallels each cellular position of accelerating lane to that of main lane. In the second case, each cell of accelerating lane keeps half cell ahead. The third case wedges each cell of accelerating lane into cells of main lane from 1/4 overlap to all. Based on a cellular automaton model, the simulations have been done to demonstrate how vehicles from on-ramp affect the traffic flow moving on main road under the above three different cases. The results show that driver behavior under the third case is closer to the real traffic situation in China, where an on-ramp car finds it hard to merge into main lane with the same velocity. All three phase diagrams show the complex phase transitions, but this reflects the degree of the stochastic nature of traffic flow in reality.

Effectiveness of Speed Control Measures on Nighttime Construction and Maintenance Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article								Nighttime work-zone safety has become a concern among state transportation agencies due to an increasing number of work-zone fatalities and the high percentage of roadwork performed at night. Speed control has been determined by numerous researchers to be one of the best ways to improve safety on nighttime work zones. This paper presents an empirical analysis of speed-control strategies for nighttime interstate construction and maintenance projects in Indiana. The analysis considers the effect of various speed-control measures on the mean speed and the standard deviation of speed through nighttime work zones. Using a seemingly unrelated regression modeling approach, the present analysis revealed that the presence of police enforcement, a high percentage of semitrucks in the traffic stream, and a high traffic flow significantly reduced mean work-zone speeds. Factors found to significantly increase mean work-zone speeds included an increase in the number of open lanes, an original speed limit of the road section greater than 100 km/h (62 mi/h) an increase in the distance between the work-zone speed-limit signs and the first cone/barrel in the construction zone taper, and the progression of time through the night. The standard deviation of vehicle speeds was found to be significantly lower before midnight and as the number of vehicles queued increased. It was found to be significantly higher with an increase in the number of open lanes through the work zone, an increase in the number of worksite speed-limit signs, a high percentage of personal vehicles in the traffic, and an increase in total traffic flow. The results from this research demonstrate a useful analysis methodology (seemingly unrelated regression estimation) and provide some empirical results that can provide guidance for transportation agencies and contractors to improve speed-control strategies in nighttime work zones.

J	Zhu, YM; Ahmad, I; Wang, L				Zhu, Yimin; Ahmad, Irtishad; Wang, Li			Estimating Work Zone Road User Cost for Alternative Contracting Methods in Highway Construction Projects	JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT-ASCE			English	Article								Highway construction often causes an additional road user cost (RUC) to motorists due to traffic flow interruption and congestion in work zones. Consequently, facility owners, such as the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT), are often interested in using alternative contracting methods such as A+B contracting to expedite construction. Although many of these contracting methods rely on the RUC to determine incentives or disincentives, no standard method for RUC calculation is available to FDOT district engineers. In addition, existing methods are neither practical nor user-friendly for determining incentives or disincentives. This study intends to develop a RUC calculation procedure for the FDOT that focuses on using data that are easily accessible to FDOT district engineers, such as drawings and maintenance of traffic plans. The procedure is developed based on traffic analysis methods published in the Highway Capacity Manual, previous studies on user benefit analysis and work zones, and empirical data specific to Florida. Case studies are used to illustrate the procedure and to compare it with two other existing models, the Arizona model and the queue and user cost evaluation of work zone model, through correlation analysis, comparison of calculation assumptions, and data input analysis. This study shows that the suggested procedure produces consistent RUC estimates.

Interaction between the two lanes is implemented as follows: particle hops with rate p when there is a particle at the same site in the other lane, otherwise it hops with rate 1. It is shown that under periodic boundary conditions, a plateau will form on the fundamental diagram if p < 1. This plateau corresponds to a phase separation phenomenon. We have compared the phase separation with those reported in previous works, and it is shown that the mechanism of phase separation in our model is different from previous ones. A possible phase separation mechanism is proposed, i.e., the system always tries to maximize the probability that particles could hop with rate 1. A simple mean field approximation and a 2-cluster mean field approach have been applied to calculate the steady current. It is shown that the results of the 2-cluster mean field approach are much closer to the simulations.

Specifically, we permit multiple lanes to be shared by both directionally traveling particles. The relation between particle density and flux is studied for several evaporation rates of pheromone, and the following results are obtained: i) in the low-particle-density range, the flux is enlarged by pheromone if the pheromone evaporation rate is sufficiently low, ii) in the high particle-density range, the flux is largest at a reasonably high evaporation rate and, iii) if the evaporation rate is at the level intermediate between the above two cases, the flux is kept small in the entire range of particle densities. The mechanism of these behaviors is investigated by observing the spatiotemporal evolution of particles and the average cluster size in the system.

The cooperation is defined ill Our model in a way that the equipped vehicle call issue and receive a warning massage when there is downstream congestion. Upon receiving the warning massage, the (up-stream) equipped vehicle will adapt the current desired speed to the speed at the congested area in order to avoid sharp deceleration when approaching file congestion. To model the dynamics Of Such cooperative systems, a multi-class gas-kinetic theory is extended to capture the adaptation of the desired speed of the equipped vehicle to (lie speed at the downstream congested traffic. Numerical simulations are carried Out to show the influence of the penetration rate of the equipped vehicles oil traffic flow stability and capacity in a freeway. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

An agent steps to the right with probability q or to the left with 1-q when encountering other agents. Our model is restricted to two agent types, traffic-rule abiders (q=1) and traffic-rule ignorers (q=1/2), and the traffic flow, resulting from the interaction between these two types of agents, which is obtained as a function of density and relative fraction. The risk for jamming at a fixed density, when starting from a disordered situation, is smaller when every agent abides by a traffic rule than when all agents ignore the rule. Nevertheless, the absolute minimum occurs when a small fraction of ignorers are present within a majority of abiders. The characteristic features for the spatial structure of the flow pattern are obtained and discussed.

This priority discipline based technique is not suitable to be applied for multilane-multiple intersections, since all vehicles in each lane move simultaneously according to its respective signal phase. In view of this scenario, a new general traffic model for multilane-multiple intersections based on queue theory and standard techniques has been developed. The model framework used in this study is M/M/I single server networks with arbitrarily-linked topology structure. A virtual server for each lane in multiple intersections is introduced in order to control the outgoing vehicles in each lane by their own server. In this study, the decomposition algorithm has been applied to deal with the feed-forward flows and finite buffer between intersections in an open queuing network model. This is achieved by decomposing the network into intersections, where each intersection was analyzed independently in order to obtain the overall model. A real case study has been conducted in one of the busiest streets in Kuala Lumpur. The study shows that the inter-arrival and inter-departure traffic flow follow the exponential distribution which also validates the chosen model. Simulation results show good correlation between the proposed models and real case studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This model is a kind of hyperbolic conservation law with spatially varying fluxes. The numerical scheme is based on a modified equivalent system which is written as a "standard" hyperbolic conservation form. Numerical experiments for both the Riemann problem and the traffic signal control problem are presented to show the effectiveness of the method.

J	van Woensel, T; Cruz, FRB				van Woensel, T.; Cruz, F. R. B.			A stochastic approach to traffic congestion costs	COMPUTERS & OPERATIONS RESEARCH			English	Article						Queueing models; Congestion costs; Traffic		The real world is a complex dynamic and stochastic environment. This is especially true for the traffic moving daily on our roads. As such, accurate modeling that correctly considers the real-world dynamics and the inherent stochasticity is very important, especially if government will base its road tax decisions on the outcomes of these models. The contemporary traffic prices, if any, however, do not reflect the external congestion costs. In order to induce road users to make the correct decision, marginal external costs should be internalized. To assess these costs, the public sector managers need accurate operational models. We show in this article that using a better representation and characterization of the road traffic, via stochastic queueing models, leads to a more adequate reflection of the congestion costs involved. Using extensive numerical experiments, we show the superiority of the stochastic traffic flow models. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Helbing and AF Johansson	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							STABILITY; CLUSTERS; DYNAMICS; WAVES	There has been a debate in the transportation research community over the validity of a class of traffic flow models. These models have the peculiar property that one of its characteristic speeds is faster than that of vehicular traffic. This note attempts to provide an overview of the diverging views on how to interpret this property, and specific comments on the interpretation of Helbing and Johansson [On the controversy around Daganzo's requiem for and Aw-Rascle's resurrection of second-order traffic flow models, Eur. Phys. J. B (2009), DOI: 10.1140/epjb/e2009-00182-7]. We showed that having faster-than-traffic characteristics does produce counterintuitive predictions, and they cannot be explained away by a linear stability analysis. As such, the existence of such characteristics must be justified by the physics of traffic, and verified through empirical observations.

J	Guikema, S; Gardoni, P				Guikema, Seth; Gardoni, Paolo			Reliability Estimation for Networks of Reinforced Concrete Bridges	JOURNAL OF INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS			English	Article							FRAGILITY; MODELS	Transportation networks are critical lifelines and their functionality after an earthquake is of primary importance for life safety and economic recovery of a community, yet they can be severely damaged during earthquakes. Reinforced concrete bridges are particularly vulnerable segments of these networks and have been severely damaged in past earthquakes. Past approaches for estimating traffic disruptions due to earthquakes have relied on computationally expensive simulations and have tended to overestimate postearthquake traffic volumes. This paper makes use of predictive fragility estimates to compute the conditional probability that a bridge in the network attains or exceeds a specified performance level for a given value of the ground motion intensity. The predictive fragilities incorporate the relevant sources of uncertainty inherent in the phenomenon. The focus of the paper is on network connectivity rather than traffic flow. The outcomes of the proposed approach can then be used by traffic models to accurately reflect postdisaster conditions. A block sampling-based simulation technique is used to estimate the network connectivity. This new approach provides a convenient, quick estimation of network reliability that complements computationally expensive traffic models.

This paper presents an advanced dynamic merge control, called a lane-based dynamic merge control model and its operational algorithm, which is based on the optimized control thresholds that take into account the interactions among the speed, flow, and available work zone capacity. The focus of this study is on how to select the control variables and to determine their optimal thresholds in response to traffic flow dynamics. Evaluation results with extensive simulation experiments have shown the promising properties of the proposed dynamic merge control and its operational algorithm.

J	Moridpour, S				Moridpour, Sara			Sensitivity of the Traffic Flows in Transportation Networks	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT-ASCE			English	Article								Obtaining the equilibrium flows in transportation networks based on optimizing users' cost is one of the important problems in urban transportation planning. Therefore, finding accurate equilibrium flows in a short time is a significant issue. The required time to solve the traffic equilibrium problem and the accuracy of the obtained results depend on the information level about the transportation system. Using more detail increases the cost of data collection and, dimensions of the problem and, therefore, creates difficulties in solving it. Certainly, a detail level of data should be proportional to the accuracy level that is required. Collecting additional data does not necessarily improve the accuracy level of the results and may only increase the design costs. In this paper, the sensitivity analysis of the equilibrium flows in traffic assignment models with respect to changes in some important transportation network attributes is considered. These attributes include: the accuracy level in measuring link specifications (e.g., width), diversity of travel time functions, intersection delay functions, the method of connecting the zone centroids to a transportation network and number of traffic zones.

Computational intelligence-based congestion prediction for a dynamic urban street network	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Letter						Evolutionary computation; Fuzzy logic; Neural networks; Traffic flow prediction	TRAFFIC FLOW; TIME-SERIES; MODELS	This paper develops a hybrid model for single point short term traffic flow forecasting in an urban traffic network. The hybrid model consists of two main modules: a fuzzy input fuzzy output filter (FIFO-filter) and a multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network architecture optimized using evolution strategies (MLFN-ES). The FIFO-filter performs the data clustering operation and provides a rough forecasted prediction value based on the input data to the MLFN-ES associated with each cluster for modeling the input-output relation to provide accurate short term forecast value. The performance of the proposed model is demonstrated by predicting the traffic flow for an intersection in the central business district (CBD) area of Singapore. The hybrid model proposed in this paper gave a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.35% on weekdays and 9.73% on weekends for the test data.

J	Lipshtat, A				Lipshtat, Azi			Effect of desired speed variability on highway traffic flow	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article						modelling; nonlinear dynamical systems; numerical analysis; statistical distributions; traffic	SIMULATION	Traffic flow is a function of many natural, environmental, and human factors. Not only that weather and road condition can vary, but drivers' decisions and policies also can affect the flow. Here we analyze the effect of distribution of desired speeds. We show that a broader distribution can reduce the flow efficiency and increase congestions. Since different drivers react differently to changes in weather or road conditions, such a change leads to a change in desired speed distribution as well. As a result, nonintuitive changes in traffic flow may occur. Besides providing insight and analyzing the underlying mechanism of a collective phenomenon, this example sheds light on a fundamental aspect of computational modeling. Although "mean-field" models that deal with average values only and ignore variability are simpler and easier to analyze, they can very easily turn into oversimplifications and miss relevant qualitative phenomena.

A conserved higher-order anisotropic traffic flow model: Description of equilibrium and non-equilibrium flows	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Hyperbolic conservation laws; Physically bounded solution; Unstable equilibrium; Stop-and-go waves	SPEED-DENSITY RELATIONSHIP; ENTROPY SOLUTIONS; FUNCTIONAL FORM; KINEMATIC WAVES; CONTINUUM MODEL; MULTICLASS; NETWORK; ROADS	This paper takes into account three regimes for the description of traffic dynamics, which include the introduction of a pseudo-density transformed from the velocity, the pressure as a function of the pseudo-density and the relaxation of velocity to equilibrium. The resultant characteristic variables can be used to measure the deviation of the phase state to a desired state and derive physically bounded solutions. Taking the pseudo-density as a conserved variable, the approach is able to describe both equilibrium and non-equilibrium flows in a systematic and unified manner, and thus complex traffic phenomena. The theoretical properties of the model are thoroughly investigated, and numerical examples are used to demonstrate the ability of the model to reproduce some notable traffic phenomena.

J	Juran, I; Prashker, JN; Bekhor, S; Ishai, I				Juran, Ido; Prashker, Joseph N.; Bekhor, Shlomo; Ishai, Ilan			A dynamic traffic assignment model for the assessment of moving bottlenecks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Dynamic traffic assignment; Moving bottlenecks; Mesoscopic simulation	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; SYSTEM OPTIMUM; WAVES	Moving bottlenecks in highway traffic are defined as a situation in which a slow-moving vehicle, be it a truck hauling heavy equipment or an oversized vehicle, or a long convey, disrupts the continuous flow of the general traffic. The effect of moving bottlenecks on traffic flow is an important factor in the evaluation of network performance. This effect, though, cannot be assessed properly by existing transportation tools, especially when the bottleneck travels relatively long distances in the network. This paper develops a dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) model that can evaluate the effects of moving bottlenecks on network performance in terms of both travel times and traveling paths. The model assumes that the characteristics of the moving bottleneck, such as traveling path, physical dimensions, and desired speed, are predefined and, therefore, suitable for planned conveys. The DTA model is based on a mesoscopic simulation network-loading procedure with unique features that allow assessing the special dynamic characteristics of a moving bottleneck. By permitting traffic density and speed to vary along a link, the simulation can capture the queue caused by the moving bottleneck while preserving the causality principles of traffic dynamics.

Modeling traffic flow interrupted by incidents	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Applied probability; Queueing; Markov modulated	QUEUING-PROBLEMS; QUEUES; SUBJECT	A steady-state M/M/c queueing System under batch service interruptions is introduced to model the traffic flow on a roadway link subject to incidents. When a traffic incident happens, either all lanes or part of a lane is closed to the traffic. As such, we model these interruptions either as complete service disruptions where none of the servers work or partial failures where servers work at a reduced service rate. We analyze this system in steady-state and present a scheme to obtain the stationary number of vehicles on a link. For those links with large c values, the closed-form solution of M/M/infinity queues under batch service interruptions call be used as all approximation. We present simulation results that show the validity of the queueing models in the computation of average travel times. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Nakayama, K. Hasebe, Y. Sugiyama, Phys. Rev. E 71 (2005) 036121]. In the proposed model, velocity difference terms are introduced, which are regarded as important factors for traffic behavior. Numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the interaction between left-turning nm-vehicle flow and straight-going in-vehicle now at a typical unsignalized interaction. The results Show that the straight-going m-vehicle flow just next to nm-lane is disturbed more seriously than others. In addition, a well-known phenomenon in reality is observed that groups of;m-vehicles and nm-vehicles pass through the intersection alternately. (C) 2009 Elsevier E.V. All rights reserved.

In the process of deceleration in advance, the effect of reaction delay and the effect of expectation are considered respectively. The traffic flow properties are Studied by analyzing the fundamental diagram, spatio-temporal patterns, distance headway distribution and car accidents. The simulation results show that reaction delay brings complex traffic flow patterns and expectation makes the serious car accidents rarely happen. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to reduce speed-related crashes, the city of Scottsdale, Arizona implemented the first fixed-camera photo speed enforcement program (SEP) on a limited access freeway in the US. The 9-month demonstration program spanning from January 2006 to October 2006 was implemented on a 6.5 mile urban freeway segment of Arizona State Route 101 running through Scottsdale. This paper presents the results of a comprehensive analysis of the impact of the SEP on speeding behavior, crashes, and the economic impact of crashes. The impact on speeding behavior was estimated using generalized least square estimation, in which the observed speeds and the speeding frequencies during the program period were compared to those during other periods. The impact of the SEP on crashes was estimated using 3 evaluation methods: a before-and-after (BA) analysis using a comparison group, a BA analysis with traffic flow correction, and an empirical Bayes BA analysis with time-variant safety. The analysis results reveal that speeding detection frequencies (speeds >= 76 mph) increased by a factor of 10.5 after the SEP was (temporarily) terminated. Average speeds in the enforcement zone were reduced by about 9 mph when the SEP was implemented, after accounting for the influence of traffic flow. All crash types were reduced except rear-end crashes, although the estimated magnitude of impact varies across estimation methods (and their corresponding assumptions). When considering Arizona-specific crash related injury costs, the SEP is estimated to yield about $17 million in annual safety benefits. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Three lane changing rules are defined for different road sections. Simulation results show that higher on-ramp rate easily produces traffic jams on main roads, on-ramps and their upstream sections. Higher off-ramp rate easily leads to conflict with the inflow of accessory road. The system having two lanes on main and accessory roads can alleviate the jam degree and decrease the vehicles' running time when on-ramp rates are high.

J	Chi, GQ				Chi, Guangqing			CAN KNOWLEDGE IMPROVE POPULATION FORECASTS AT SUBCOUNTY LEVELS?	DEMOGRAPHY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Annual Meeting of the Southern-Demographic-Association	OCT 12-13, 2007	Birmingham, AL	SE Demograph Assoc			UNITED-STATES; REGRESSION-MODELS; PLACE PREFERENCES; TIME-SERIES; LAND-USE; MIGRATION; GROWTH; PROJECTIONS; ACCURACY; TESTS	Recent developments in urban and regional planning require more accurate population forecasts at subcounty levels, as well as a consideration of inlet-actions among population growth, traffic flow, land use, and environmental impacts. However; the extrapolation methods, currently the most often used demographic forecasting techniques for subcounty areas, cannot meet the demand This study tests a knowledge-based regression approach, which hay been successfully used for forecasts at the national level, for subcounty population forecasting. In particular, this study applies four regression models that incorporate demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, transportation accessibility, natural amenities, and land development to examine the population change since 1970 and to prepare the 1990-based forecast of year 2000 population at the minor civil division level in Wisconsin. The findings indicate that this approach does not outperform the extrapolation projections. Although the regression methods produce more precise projections, the least biased projections are often generated by one of the extrapolation techniques. The performance of the knowledge-based regression methods is discounted at subcounty levels by temporal instability and the scale effect. The regression coefficients exhibit a statistically significant level of temporal instability across the estimation and projection periods and tend to change more rapidly at finer geographic scales.

J	Zhang, Y; Liu, YC				Zhang, Yang; Liu, Yuncai			Data Imputation Using Least Squares Support Vector Machines in Urban Arterial Streets	IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING LETTERS			English	Article						Data imputation; least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs); urban arterial streets		Some traffic data from loop detectors settled in urban arterial streets are incomplete. The importance of effectively imputing the missing values emerges. The letter introduces least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) to missing traffic flow prediction based on spatio-temporal analysis. It is the first time to apply the technique to missing data imputation. A baseline imputation technique, expectation maximization/data augmentation (EM/DA), is selected for comparison because of its proved effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is more applicable and performs better at relatively high missing data rates. This reveals that it is a promising approach in the field.

A MODIFIED CELLULAR AUTOMATION MODEL FOR RING ROAD TRAFFIC WITH VELOCITY GUIDANCE	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						Traffic flow; velocity guidance; traffic light; cellular automation model	PHYSICS; FLOW	We present a modified cellular automation model to study the traffic flow on a signal controlled ring road with velocity guidance. The velocity guidance is such a strategy that when vehicle approach the traffic light, suggested velocities are provided for avoiding the vehicles' sharp brakes in front of red light. Simulation results show that this strategy may significantly reduce the vehicles' stopping rate and the effect size is dependent upon the traffic density, the detector position, the signal's cycle time and the obedience rate of vehicles to the guidance.

For this purpose, we developed the MATDYMO (multi-agent for traffic simulation with vehicle dynamics model) and validated it with comparison to commercial software, TRANSYT-7F, for an interrupted flow model and to URFSIM (urban freeway traffic simulation model) for an uninterrupted flow model. These comparisons showed that MATDYMO is able to estimate the traffic situation with only incoming traffic volume. Using MATDYMO, ramp metering and traffic signal control can be optimized simultaneously. We extracted 80 sampling points from the DOE (Design of Experiment) and derived each response from MATDYMO. Then, a neural network was adopted to approximate the objective function, and simulated annealing was used as an optimization method. There are three cases of the objective function: maximization of the freeway traffic volume, minimization of the delay of ramps and arterials, and the satisfaction of both cases. The optimization results showed that traffic flow in freeway corridors can be maintained to a steady stream by ramp metering and signal control.

The optimal velocity model, defined by a differential equation, is one of the most important models; in particular, it successfully reproduces the instability of high-flux traffic. It is often pointed out that there is a close relation between the optimal velocity model and the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mkdV) equation, a soliton equation. Meanwhile, the ultradiscrete method enables one to reduce soliton equations to cellular automata which inherit the solitonic nature, such as an infinite number of conservation laws, and soliton solutions. We find that the theory of soliton equations is available for generic differential equations and the simulation results reveal that the model obtained reproduces both absolutely unstable and convectively unstable flows as well as the optimal velocity model.

Effects of time-gap settings of adaptive cruise control (ACC) on driving performance and subjective acceptance in a bus driving simulator	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Adaptive cruise control (ACC); Time-gap settings; Safety; Bus	RECLAIMING CONTROL; VALIDATION; EXAMPLE; TASK	A study was conducted to investigate the effects of time-gap settings and contents of secondary tasks on a fix-based bus driving simulator on drivers' performance while reclaiming control from ACC in a car-following scenario of emergency brake by the lead vehicle. Thirty professional bus drivers drove on the simulator with the scenario of highway traffic flow under 12 random time-gap settings: from 0.64 s to 2.40 s with the interval of 0.16 s. As for the effects of secondary tasks, subjects were evenly divided into three conditions: no secondary task interference, simple secondary task, and complex task. The results demonstrated that different safety demarcations of time-gaps on subjective acceptance and driving performance can be found out. The integrated demarcations separated time-gaps into divisions that represented different levels of danger. It revealed that the safer time-gaps for different situations were: longer than 1.60 s for none-secondary task distraction and longer than 2.08 s for being continuously distracted by secondary tasks. The demand for simple tasks is relatively high, so a larger time-gap is needed for the driver to remain safe. This research has implications for the time-gap selection of ACC and effects of secondary task distraction on buses. A next logical step will focus on determining time-gaps for lead vehicles on curves or slopes, when multiple vehicles are present ahead, and modeling driver behavior and performance with ACC for cars, buses, and other types of vehicles.

J	Li, BB				Li, Baibing			A Non-Gaussian Kalman Filter With Application to the Estimation of Vehicular Speed	TECHNOMETRICS			English	Article						Dynamic generalized linear model; Non-Gaussian Kalman filter; Reciprocal inverse Gaussian distribution; State-space model	TIME-SERIES; ALGORITHM; MODELS	Single inductive loop detectors (ILDs), which provide online measurements of traffic volume and occupancy, are widely used devices in road systems. Because of the nature of traffic flow, fast estimation and forecasting of vehicular speed using the data collected by an ILD are crucial to online road traffic management. Here we formulate statistical inference for vehicular speed as a dynamic generalized linear model with a reciprocal inverse Gaussian observational distribution. The formulation motivates us to extend the Gaussian Kalman filter to this non-Gaussian scenario. This results in a set of simple recursive formulas in which the current estimate of the parameter of interest is updated as a weighted harmonic average of the previous estimate and the current observation. By applying the developed non-Gaussian Kalman filter to analyze traffic data collected by an ILD, we provide a competitive alternative for estimating vehicular speed at a minimum computational cost.

J	Holguin-Veras, J; Cetin, M				Holguin-Veras, Jose; Cetin, Mecit			Optimal tolls for multi-class traffic: Analytical formulations and policy implications	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Optimal pricing; Multi-class traffic; Congestion pricing; Freight road pricing	RECEIVER-CARRIER POLICIES; OFF-PEAK HOURS; CONGESTION TOLLS; TRAVEL-TIME; ROAD; EQUILIBRIUM; BEHAVIOR; NETWORK; URBAN; TRANSPORTATION	This paper puts together an analytical formulation to compute optimal tolls for multiclass traffic. The formulation is comprised of two major modules. The first one is an optimization component aimed at computing optimal tolls assuming a Stackelberg game in which the toll agency sets the tolls, and the equilibrating traffic plays the role of the followers. The optimization component is supported by a set of cost models that estimate the externalities as a function of a multivariate vector of traffic flows. These models were estimated using Taylor series expansions of the output obtained from traffic simulations of a hypothetical test case. Of importance to the paper is the total travel time function estimated using this approach that expresses total travel time as a multivariate function of the traffic volumes. The formulation presented in the paper is then applied to a variety of scenarios to gain insight into the optimality of current toll policies. The optimal tolls are computed for two different cases: independent tolls, and tolls proportional to passenger car equivalencies (PCE). The numerical results clearly show that setting tolls proportional to PCEs leads to lower values of welfare that are on average 15% lower than when using independent tolls, though, in some cases the total welfare could be up to 33% lower. This is a consequence of two factors. First, the case of independent tolls has more degrees of freedom than the case of tolls proportional to PCEs. Second, tolls proportional to PCEs do not account for externalities other than congestion, which is likely to lead to lower welfare values. The analytical formulations and numerical results indicate that, because the total travel time is a non-linear function of the traffic volumes, the marginal social costs and thus the optimal congestion tolls also depend on the traffic volumes for each vehicle class. As a result of this, for the relatively low volumes of truck traffic observed in real life, the optimal congestion tolls for trucks could indeed be either lower or about the same as for passenger cars. This stand in sharp contrast with what is implied in the use of PCEs, i.e., that the contribution to congestion are constant. This latter assumption leads to optimal truck congestion tolls that are always proportional to the PCE values. The comparison of the toll ratios (truck tolls divided by passenger car tolls) for both observed and optimal conditions suggests that the tolls for small trucks are about the right level, maybe a slightly lower than optimal. However, the analysis of the toll ratio for large trucks seems to indicate a significant overcharge, The estimates show that the average observed toll ratio for large trucks is even higher than the maximum optimal toll ratio found in the numerical experiments. This suggests that the tolls for large trucks are set oil the basis of revenue generation principles while the passenger car tolls are being set based oil a mild form of welfare maximization. This leads to a suboptimal cross-subsidization of passenger car traffic in detriment of an important sector of the economy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Eliasson, J				Eliasson, Jonas			A cost-benefit analysis of the Stockholm congestion charging system	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						Congestion charges; Road pricing; Cost-benefit analysis	TENTATIVE ECONOMIC APPRAISAL; MARGINAL COST; PRUDHOMME	This paper presents a cost-benefit analysis of the Stockholm congestion charging system, based on the observed rather than on the model-forecasted data. The most important data sources are travel time and traffic flow measurements made in the year before the charges were introduced (during April 2005) and during the first spring with the charges (during April 2006, 4 months after the charges were introduced). Using matrix calibration, effects on the non-observed link flows and travel times are extrapolated, enabling us to calculate the social value of changes in travel times and travel costs. Impacts on traffic safety and emissions are calculated using standard Swedish CBA relationships. The system is shown to yield a significant social surplus, well enough to cover both investment and operating costs, provided that it is kept for a reasonable lifetime: investment and startup costs are "recovered" in terms of social benefits in around 4 years.

J	Pandian, S; Gokhale, S; Ghoshal, AK				Pandian, Suresh; Gokhale, Sharad; Ghoshal, Aloke Kumar			Evaluating effects of traffic and vehicle characteristics on vehicular emissions near traffic intersections	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Vehicular exhaust emissions; Driving patterns; Traffic speed; Traffic intersections; Air quality	NONLINEAR HYDRODYNAMIC MODELS; FUEL CONSUMPTION; POLLUTANT EMISSIONS; EXHAUST EMISSIONS; SPEED; FLOW; IMPACT; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; ACCELERATION	Urban air quality is generally poor at traffic intersections due to variations in vehicles' speeds as they approach and leave. This paper examines the effect of traffic, vehicle and road characteristics on vehicular emissions with a view to understand a link between emissions and the most likely influencing and measurable characteristics. It demonstrates the relationships of traffic, vehicle and intersection characteristics with vehicular exhaust emissions and reviews the traffic flow and emission models. Most studies have found that vehicular exhaust emissions near traffic intersections are largely dependent on fleet speed, deceleration speed, queuing time in idle mode with a red signal time, acceleration speed, queue length, traffic-flow rate and ambient conditions. The vehicular composition also affects emissions. These parameters can be quantified and incorporated into the emission models. There is no validated methodology to quantify some non-measurable parameters such as driving behaviour, pedestrian activity, and road conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wei, ZQ; Hong, YG; Wang, DH				Wei Ziqiang; Hong Yiguang; Wang Dahui			The phase diagram and the pathway of phase transitions for traffic flow in a circular one-lane roadway	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Intelligent driver model; Linearization analysis; Numerical simulation; Traffic flow	MODEL; STATES	This paper demonstrates that patient driving habits lead to homogenous congested flow while impatient driving habits lead to wide-moving jam flow in the high density region based on the numerical simulation of the intelligent driver model proposed by M.Treiber [M.Treiber,A.Hennecke, D. Helbing, Phys. Rev. E62(2)(2000),1805-1824]. In a circular one lane traffic system which includes homogeneous drivers, we obtain the stable condition of homogenous flow and the phase diagram of traffic flow based on the linearization analysis. The phase diagram shows three possible pathways of phase transition along with the increase of global density: from the homogenous free flow to the homogenous congested flow directly, from the homogenous free flow to the synchronized flow then to the homogenous congested flow, or from the homogenous free flow to synchronized flow then to the wide-moving jam flow. The paper also analyzes the traffic flow including heterogenous drivers, and the results indicate that homogenous congested flow will lose its stability when the proportion of impatient drivers reaches a critical value and some new kinds of traffic flow emerge: wide-moving jam flow ora mixture of synchronized flow and wide-moving jam flow.

The results show that the average speed and the traffic flux under control of the later are greater than that controled by the former.

The urban road network of Bangalore city has been selected as the study area. Sixteen locations are chosen in major traffic junctions of the study area. The traffic noise data collected from the study locations were analyzed separately for both acceleration and deceleration lanes when vehicles leave an intersection on a green traffic light and come to a stop on red traffic light. Based on the study, a regression noise prediction model has been developed for both acceleration and deceleration lanes.	[Rajakumara, H.

A power law for the duration of high-flow states and its interpretation from a heterogeneous traffic flow perspective	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							STEADY-STATE; EXCLUSION MODELS; 1/F NOISE; SIMULATION; EQUATION; KINETICS; FEATURES; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS	We study the duration of "high-flow states" in freeway traffic, defined as the time periods for which traffic flows exceed a given flow threshold. Our empirical data are surprisingly well represented by a power law. Moreover, the power law exponent for a two-lane freeway seems to be independent of the chosen flow threshold. In order to interpret this discovery, we investigate a simple theoretical model of heterogeneous traffic with overtaking maneuvers, which is able to reproduce both, the empirical power law and its exponent.

Online-SVR for short-term traffic flow prediction under typical and atypical traffic conditions	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Short-term flow forecast; Intelligent transportation systems (ITS); Online support vector machine (OL-SVM); Online support vector regression (OL-SVR); Traffic volume prediction	NEURAL-NETWORKS; REGRESSION; VOLUME; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	Most literature on short-term traffic flow forecasting focused mainly on normal, or non-incident, conditions and, hence, limited their applicability when traffic flow forecasting is most needed, i.e., incident and atypical conditions. Accurate prediction of short-term traffic flow under atypical conditions, such as vehicular crashes, inclement weather, work zone, and holidays, is crucial to effective and proactive traffic management systems in the context of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and, more specifically, dynamic traffic assignment (DTA). To this end, this paper presents an application of a supervised statistical learning technique called Online Support Vector machine for Regression, or OL-SVR, for the prediction of short-term freeway traffic flow under both typical and atypical conditions. The OL-SVR model is compared with three well-known prediction models including Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML), Holt exponential smoothing, and artificial neural net models. The resultant performance comparisons suggest that GML, which relies heavily on the recurring characteristics of day-to-day traffic, performs slightly better than other models under typical traffic conditions, as demonstrated by previous studies. Yet OL-SVR is the best performer under non-recurring atypical traffic conditions. It appears that for deployed ITS systems that gear toward timely response to real-world atypical and incident situations, OL-SVR may be a better tool than GML (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

An Investigation of Driver Distraction Near the Tipping Point of Traffic Flow Stability	HUMAN FACTORS			English	Article							CELL PHONE CONVERSATIONS; DRIVING PERFORMANCE; IMPACT; TASK	Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the interrelationship between driver distraction and characteristics of driver behavior associated with reduced highway traffic efficiency. Background: Research on the three-phase traffic theory and on behavioral driving suggests that a number of characteristics associated with efficient traffic flow may be affected by driver distraction. Previous studies have been limited, however, by the fact that researchers typically do not allow participants to change lanes, nor do they account for the impact of varying traffic states on driving performance. Methods: Participants drove in three simulated environments with differing traffic congestion while both using and not using a cell phone. Instructed only to obey the speed limit, participants were allowed to vary driving behaviors, such as those involving forward following distance, speed, and lane-changing frequency. Results: Both driver distraction and traffic congestion were found to significantly affect lane change frequency, mean speed, and the likelihood of remaining behind a slower-moving lead vehicle. Conclusions: This research suggests that the behavioral profile of "cell phone drivers," which is often described as compensatory, may have far-reaching and unexpected consequences for traffic efficiency.

Hydrodynamic modeling of traffic jams in intracellular transport in axons	INTERNATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS IN HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER			English	Article						Numerical; Molecular motors; Motor-assisted transport; Neurons; Axons and dendrites; Intracellular organelles; Traffic jams	CYTOPLASMIC DYNEIN; KINESIN; DISEASE; MOTORS	Irregularities in intracellular traffic in axons caused by mutations of molecular motors may lead to "traffic jams", which often result in swelling of axons causing such neurodegenerative diseases as Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. Hence, it is of particular interest to mathematically model the formation of traffic jams in axons. This paper adopts the hydrodynamic continuity equations for intracellular transport of organelles as developed by Smith and Simmons [D.A. Smith, R.M. Simmons, Models of motor-assisted transport of intracellular particles, Biophysical journal 80 (2001) 45-68.] whereas the Kerner and Konhauser [B.S. Kerner, P. Konhauser, Cluster effect in initially homogeneous traffic flow, Physical Review E 48 (1993), R2335-R2338.] model for traffic jams in highway traffic is applied to predict the velocity field. It is observed that combination of the two sets of equations can comprehensively predict the traffic jams in axons without the need to any additional assumption or modification.

The main street and the minor street join at the intersection. As to the traffic flow is not controlled by traffic lights, conflict happens between the vehicles from minor street and that from main street. Two different crash avoiding rules are used to dispose the conflicts. In the first rule, the priorities are given to the driving-ahead vehicle and the vehicle on the main street. In the second rule, the vehicle that reaches the conflicting point earlier enters into the intersection. The flux on each lane depending on the inflow rates is studied in detail. The capacity of the system is also investigated. Our simulation results suggest that the two rules do not take the same effect on the capacity under different traffic conditions.

Changes to roadway lane configurations were then made to achieve LOS thresholds of E through A. Many local jurisdictions seek to preserve adequate infrastructure by enacting level of service (LOS) policies for proposed new development. Understanding the relationship between roadway LOS policies and greenhouse gas emissions is an important step toward reducing the emissions related to global climate change. By influencing the evolution of urban infrastructure, these LOS standards can have a significant impact on the type and character of vehicle trips made and the subsequent emissions released. Currently, most jurisdictions establish LOS threshold policies based solely on operational standards and rarely consider the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions. Using a travel demand forecasting model for Grover Beach, CA, buildout conditions were simulated to make the network have operational deficiencies in critical areas, ultimately operating at a LOS F. Changes to roadway lane configurations were then made to achieve LOS thresholds of LOS E through LOS A. The resulting speed and flow data were analyzed in emission models to determine the relationship between the target LOS thresholds and emissions produced. The network was modeled for both roadway link LOS and intersection LOS conditions. For roadway links, overall, the lowest amounts of emissions were released at the LOS B threshold and the greatest incremental decrease in emissions occurred between LOS D and C. At intersections, the lowest emissions point was LOS A and the largest incremental decrease occurred between LOS D and C. When considering the feasibility of implementation of LOS thresholds, LOS C was determined to be the most effective operating point for emissions.

We extend the conventional optimal velocity model to the multi-lane traffic by taking into account the lane changing. The dynamical state of the traffic changes with increasing density. The dynamical phase transitions occur at certain densities. It is found that there are four distinct states for the two-lane traffic flow including a slow vehicle: (1) the free traffic at a low density, (2) the jammed traffic at an intermediate density, (3) the homogeneous traffic with different occupancies on the first and second lanes, at increasing density furthermore, and (4) the congested traffic with the same occupancy on the first and second lanes at a high density. Traffic state (2) is divided into two dynamic states for the three-lane and four-lane traffic. In addition, traffic state (3) is divided into two dynamic states for the four-lane traffic. The dependence of the current on the velocity of a slow vehicle is derived numerically and analytically.

J	Kuznetsov, AV; Avramenko, AA				Kuznetsov, A. V.; Avramenko, A. A.			A macroscopic model of traffic jams in axons	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Molecular motors; Motor-assisted transport; Neurons; Axons and dendrites; Intracellular organelles; Traffic jams	MOLECULAR MOTORS; TRANSPORT; KINESIN; DISEASE; DYNEIN	The purpose of this paper is to develop a minimal macroscopic model capable of explaining the formation of traffic jams in fast axonal transport. The model accounts for the decrease of the number density of positively (and negatively) oriented microtubules near the location of the traffic jam due to formation of microtubule swirls: the model also accounts for the reduction of the effective velocity of organelle transport in the traffic jam region due to organelles falling off microtubule tracks more often in the swirl region. The model is based on molecular-motor-assisted transport equations and the hydrodynamic model of traffic jams in highway traffic. Parametric analyses-of the model's predictions for various values of viscosity of the traffic flow, variance of the velocity distribution, diffusivity of microtubule-bound and free organelles, rate constants for binding to and detachment from microtubules, relaxation time, and average motor velocities of the retrograde and anterograde transport, are carried out.

At the intersection, drivers have to enter a road of a shorter trip-time, by making a turn if necessary, as indicated on the information board. Dynamics of the traffic are expressed as a return map in the density-flow space. The traffic flow is classified into six phases, as a function of the car density. It is found that such a behavior of drivers induces too much concentration of cars on one road and, as a result, causes oscillation of the flow and the density of cars on both roads. The oscillation usually results in a reduced total flow, except for the cases of high car density. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To obtain a better understanding of hit-and-run behavior, a logistic regression model has been applied in this study to identify the factors that might affect the occurrence of hit-and-run in fatal crashes in California, USA. Our results show that roadway functional class, routes, traffic flow, types of roadway section, speed limit, traffic control device, functioning of traffic control device, lighting condition, roadway alignment and roadway profile are important determinants that engineers can target to reduce hit-and-run in fatal crashes. In addition, targeted traffic enforcement should be performed on weekends and nighttime. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Cheng, MY; Wu, YW; Chen, SJ; Weng, MC				Cheng, Min-Yuan; Wu, Yu-Wei; Chen, Sheng-Jin; Weng, Ming-Chuan			Economic evaluation model for post-earthquake bridge repair/rehabilitation: Taiwan case studies	AUTOMATION IN CONSTRUCTION			English	Article						Bridge; Earthquake; Repair; Rehabilitation; Economic evaluation	MAINTENANCE; OPTIMIZATION; ALGORITHM	Taiwan, located in a zone of strong seismic activity, is subject to earthquakes that regularly threaten human life, property and transportation facilities. The importance of bridges to Taiwan's transportation grid makes the impact of their destruction or damage during an earthquake significant on people's livelihoods. However, within the overall transportation grid, the relative importance of individual bridges differs. based on the importance of each to society and the economy. Therefore, key to reducing overall economic costs is the ability to determine quickly and efficiently the bridges that deserve priority consideration for immediate repair/rehabilitation following a destructive natural incident. This research developed an Economic Evaluation Model for post-earthquake bridge repair/rehabilitation to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of repair/rehabilitation decision making. The three components of this model include the: (1) emergency repair estimation model, (2) travel cost estimation model, and (3) economic evaluation model. The emergency repair estimation model involves a feasible evaluation of repair/rehabilitation schemes as well as cost and construction duration times, while the travel cost estimation model identifies the shortest detour path and impact on traffic flow using ArcGIS and TransCAD.

The aggregation approach assembles information from relevant time series. The source time series is the traffic flow volume that is collected 24 h/day over several years. The three relevant time series are a weekly similarity time series, a daily similarity time series, and an hourly time series, which can be directly generated from the source time series. The MA, ES, and ARIMA models are selected to give predictions of the three relevant time series. The predictions that result from the different, models are used as the basis of the NN in the aggregation stage. The output of the trained NN serves as the final prediction. To assess the performance of the different models, the naive, ARIMA, nonparametric regression, NN, and data aggregation (DA) models are applied to the prediction of a real vehicle traffic flow, from which data have been collected at a data-collection point that is located on National Highway 107, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. The outcome suggests that the DA model obtains a more accurate forecast than any individual model alone. The aggregation strategy can offer substantial benefits in terms of improving operational forecasting.

The proposed model formulation has an integrate base structured with a mesoscopic link load-computing component that explicitly takes into account the acceleration behavior of discrete vehicle packets and an algorithm written with a set of nodal rules considering the constraints of link dynamics, flow conservation, flow propagation, and boundary conditions. The solution to the model formulation is obtained by simulation, where the coded algorithm of the proposed solution method is run after designing a discrete version of the problem. The performance of the proposed model, as a DNL model, is tested on a sample highway network following its validation study that is obtained on a sample highway node. It is seen that the proposed model provides consistent approximations to link flow dynamics. The new dynamic node model proposed in this paper is unique in that it encapsulates a mesoscopic approach in node-based flow dynamics modeling.

J	Innamaa, S				Innamaa, S.			Self-adapting traffic flow status forecasts using clustering	IET INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRAVEL-TIME; PREDICTION	A key problem for the efficient use of stationary traffic prediction models is that for adaptation to new data they require human-made re-calibration with a new database. So far, there has been a lack of knowledge of how to develop a practical prediction model that would learn while working online. Anyone providing real-time traffic information and making forecasts of the traffic situation could benefit from such models. The aim of the study is to develop a method to make a self-adapting short-term prediction model for the status of traffic flow. The principles for such a model are described. The method is based on self-organising map and the model is implemented on a highway in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area. Specifically, the structure of the model makes it possible for the model to learn by itself without the need to save all the data into databases. Consequently, long-term online use of the model makes fewer demands on computers. The results indicated that the self-adapting principle improved the performance of the model. The principles of the model can also be applied in other locations.

In this approach a primary model is synthesized based on Neural Networks and then the model structure is optimized through Genetic Algorithm. Vie proposed approach is applied to a rural highwav, Ghazvin-Rasht Road in Iran. The obtained results are acceptable and indicate that the proposed approach can improve model accuracy while reducing model structure complexity. Minimum achieved prediction r2 is 0.73 and number of connection links at least reduced 20% as a result of optimization.

A framework for user equilibrium dynamic traffic assignment	JOURNAL OF THE OPERATIONAL RESEARCH SOCIETY			English	Article						traffic; road transport; dynamic traffic assignment; user equilibrium; bi-level programme	VARIATIONAL INEQUALITY FORMULATION; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; LINK MODELS; WAVES	Several analytic approaches have been developed to describe or predict traffic flows on networks with time-varying (dynamic) travel demands, flows and travel times. A key component of these models lies in modelling the flows and/or travel times on the individual links, but as this is made more realistic or accurate it tends to make the overall model less computationally tractable. To help overcome this, and for other reasons, we develop a bi-level user equilibrium (UE) framework that separates the assignment or loading of flows on the time-space network from the modelling of flows and trip times within individual links. We show that this model or framework satisfies appropriate definitions of UE satisfies a first-in-first-out (FIFO) property of road traffic, and has other desirable properties. The model can be solved by iterating between (a) a linear network-loading model that takes the lengths of time-space links as fixed (within narrow ranges), and (b) a set of link flow sub-models which update the link trip times to construct a new time-space network. This allows links to be processed sequentially or in parallel and avoids having to enumerate paths and compute path flows or travel times. We test and demonstrate the model and algorithms using example networks and find that the algorithm converges quickly and the solutions behave as expected. We show how to extend the model to handle elastic demands, multiple destinations and multiple traffic types, and traffic spillback within links and from link to link.

J	Parola, F; Sciomachen, A				Parola, Francesco; Sciomachen, Anna			Modal split evaluation of a maritime container terminal	MARITIME ECONOMICS & LOGISTICS			English	Article						maritime container terminal; modal re-equilibrium; container handling system; discrete event simulation	SIMULATION-MODEL; OPTIMIZATION; SYSTEM	Maritime container terminals are playing a growing role within global transport chains. As intermodal nodes between sea traffic flows and inland distribution, they are very important to shipping lines. The current trend of moving towards economies of scale in regard to mother vessels is also having a tremendous impact on seaport operations and hinterland transportation in terms of 'call size'. This paper deals with the study of multimodal container flows at an Italian maritime terminal, focusing the attention on the performance of road and rail connections. In this framework, the current modal unbalance generates heavy problems of congestion and compromises the overall terminal competitiveness. This paper applies a discrete event simulation approach, in order to evaluate the feasibility of an alternative and more balanced scenario achievable in a short-mid-term perspective. Our goal is to enhance the performance of rail connections, without proposing the realisation of a new railway line which is only attainable in the long run, but trying to exploit to the full the available endowment of assets through a deep operational restructuring. Simulation runs performed in this perspective revealed the adequacy of such an approach and demonstrated the successful effects of a modal re-equilibrium.

In the system, two classified driver agents coexist: C agents (cooperative strategy) always driving in the first lane and D agents (defective strategy) trying to drive in a lower-density lane whether the first or the second lane. In high-density flow, D agents' interruption into the first lane from the second just before the lane-closing section creates a heavier traffic jam, which reduces social efficiency. This particular event can be described with a prisoner's dilemma game structure.

J	Shen, W; Zhang, HM				Shen, Wei; Zhang, H. M.			On the morning commute problem in a corridor network with multiple bottlenecks: Its system-optimal traffic flow patterns and the realizing tolling scheme	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Morning commute; System-optimum; Dynamic congestion pricing; Corridor control	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; DEPARTURE TIME; ASSIGNMENT	There have been numerous studies of the morning commute problem in a network with a single route or parallel routes with a single bottleneck on each route. Most congested networks, however, often contain more than one congestion spot along each route. In such networks, it is usually difficult to derive analytically their system-optimal traffic patterns and the tolls that realize them. In this paper, we study the morning commute problem in such a network with certain special topological features - a freeway with multiple entry/exit ramps and a surface street grid with large capacities. For this type of networks, we investigated the basic characteristics of their optimal dynamic traffic patterns and the corresponding tolling scheme, for which a graphical solution procedure was also developed. In this network, we found that at system-optimum: (1) the aggregate traffic flow on the freeway has a staircase temporal profile, and piecewise linear dynamic tolls can be imposed on a subset of ramps to achieve it; (2) among all the off-ramps in use, the ones closer to the destination are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges than the ones farther away from the destination; and (3) among all the on-ramps in use, the ones with larger cumulative volume-to-capacity ratios are being tolled longer with higher maximum toll charges. Some practical implications of these findings to corridor traffic management were also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Shen, Wei; Zhang, H.

Most models presented so far devote more attention to one of the two issues. This paper aims to achieve consistent integration between the two components, focusing in particular on the order of arrival to nodes. A novel concept of anticipated arrival order (AAO) is proposed to describe the number of vehicles expected to choose a certain downstream link at a diverge road-node as a function of the total number of vehicles that arrived at this road-node. An iterative procedure is proposed. In each iteration. a route flow propagation model is used to determine the AAO for the entire modeling horizon; then, a traffic behavior model uses the AAO to determine cumulative volumes for the entire horizon. Computational results show that this unique non-chronological heuristic approach to DNL can indeed provide consistent solutions so that residual FIFO violation is monitored. The proposed model is an analytic macroscopic model with continuous flows. We chose to examine the AAO concept using a traffic flow behavior that follows the kinematic waves model with a triangular flow-density relationship. The single-link model is converted to an equivalent variations problem and solved on a dense discrete intra-link time-space mesh by a standard least-cost-path algorithm for acyclic graphs.

Improving noise assessment at intersections by modeling traffic dynamics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART D-TRANSPORT AND ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Urban traffic noise; Signalized intersection; Roundabout; Traffic dynamics; Traffic management; Urban planning		Three families of road noise prediction models can be distinguished. Static noise models only consider free-flow constant-speed traffic with uniformly distributed vehicles. Analytic noise models assume that all vehicles are isolated from one another but account for their mean kinematic profile over the network. Micro-simulation noise models relax the hypothesis of no interaction between vehicles and fully capture traffic flow dynamic effects such as queue evolution. This study compares the noise levels obtained by these three methodologies at signalized intersections and roundabouts. It reveals that micro-simulation noise models outperform the other approaches. Particularly, they are able to capture the effects of stochastic transient queues in under-saturated conditions as well as stop-and-go behaviors in oversaturated regime. Accounting for traffic dynamics is also shown to improve predictions of noise variations due to different junction layouts. In this paper, a roundabout is found to induce a 2.5 dB(A) noise reduction compared to a signalized intersection in undersaturated conditions while the acoustic contributions of both kinds of junctions balance in oversaturated regime.

An understanding of the factors affecting this complex decision making process is essential to a wide range of theoretical issues including driver workload, capacity and the modeling of freeway flow, as well as practical applications such as the design of in-vehicle driver aids and assistance systems, many of which have direct relevance to increasing driver safety. The study used an instrumented vehicle to collect time dependent following data for a group of test drivers. Data was collected on two differing types of high speed road, using six primary subjects who drove a test vehicle, supplemented by data on 123 drivers that were observed following the test vehicle. Examination was made of how the time headway chosen by a driver is influenced by a range of situational variables commonly believed to effect behavior, with four main findings. Firstly, headway was found to change according to the type of vehicle being followed (i.e. subjects followed closer to trucks than to cars), secondly, little variation was found with changes in overall traffic flow, thirdly, little correlation was round with road type, and lastly a distinct day-to-day variation in individual behavior was observed.

J	Peng, LJ; Kang, R				Peng Li-Juan; Kang Rui			One-dimensional cellular automaton model of traffic flow considering drivers' features	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						traffic flow; cellular automaton; drivers' features; computer numerical simulation	2-LANE	Based on the WWH model and SDNaSch model for one-dimensional cellular automaton traffic flow, a Driver-SDNaScli model considering the drivers' features is established. In this model, drivers are classified into such three types as aggressive, cautious and neutral, and their states are updated following their respective evolution rules, which are made according to the different driving features of these three types. In addition, the safe deceleration probability is introduced when considering the condition of having a stationary vehicle ahead. By using the computer numerical simulation of the Driver-SDNaSch model, the velocity-density and flow-density diagrams of the mixed traffic flow, whose features are also analysed and discussed, with the three types of drivers in different proportions, are presented. The Driver-SDNaSch model, compared with the NaSch model and SDNaSch model, is believed to further reduce the traffic jams so as to increase the traffic capacity.

The threshold of the safety headway in lane-changing process is calibrated. Both the lane-changing process and the impact of the lane-changing vehicle on the adjacent vehicles are incorporated into the proposed model. Therefore, simulated results using the proposed model agree with the surveyed results. The marginal decrease of lane capacity with the number of lanes is analysed and validated upon the proposed lane-changing model. We find that the vehicle velocity decreases and the lane changing probability increases with the increasing number of lanes under the congested condition of highways in cities.

The presence of rabbits adjacent to roads increases polecat road mortality	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Article						Carnivore conservation; Mustela putorius; Oryctolagus cuniculus; Resources distribution; Road verge; Traffic; Unbroken line	NEW-SOUTH-WALES; MUSTELA-PUTORIUS; HABITAT USE; ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; VEHICLE COLLISIONS; LOW-DENSITY; CONSERVATION; WILDLIFE; MAMMALS; AVAILABILITY	Road mortality is an increasing problem for terrestrial vertebrate conservation due to the increase of both road numbers and vehicle flow. We hypothesize that the probability of a predator being killed on the road is related to the presence of its prey adjacent to the road, which is likely to be related to the use that these predators make of road verges. We aim to identify the features of specific stretches of road where road-kills of a predator (European polecat) occur in Mediterranean landscapes, including the presence of its main prey (European rabbit) and landscape and road features. We compared 85 100 m long stretches of road where at least one road-kill was recorded with 104 stretches without any road-kill in a dry agricultural landscape in central Spain. We used regression analysis to investigate the relationship between road-kill occurrence and the features in the 67% of the cases. Road-kill stretches were characterised by greater numbers of rabbit burrows in the road verges and by higher traffic flow and speed (i.e. higher speed limit, lower proportion of heavy vehicles, wider road and lower proportion of unbroken central lines). Road-kill stretches also had more metres built over bridges and lower densities of people. We validated our best model with a dataset (the 33% of the cases) not included in its development, which correctly classified 82% of road-kill stretches and 89% of non-road kill stretches. Our results highlight the need for taking into account food resource distribution when studying causes of animal road-kills.

J	Mhirech, A; Ismaili, AA; Ez-Zahraouy, H				Mhirech, Abdelaziz; Ismaili, Assia Alaoui; Ez-Zahraouy, Hamid			The effect of on-ramp and off-ramp on the one dimensional road with open boundaries	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION MODEL; TRAFFIC-FLOW; CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; PHASE-TRANSITIONS; RULES	The effect of one on-ramp (entry) and one off-ramp (exit) is investigated numerically in a one dimensional cellular automaton traffic flow model, with open boundary conditions, using parallel dynamics. Our aim in this paper is to study how the injection rates a and alpha(0) and the extraction rates beta and beta(0) act on the density and flux of cars in a one dimensional road. The priority of occupation at entry site i(1) (removing at exit site i(2)) is attributed to the particle that entered (was absorbed) the chain. Phase diagrams in (beta(0), alpha(0)) and (beta, alpha(0)) plans are established. For alpha = 0.1, they show three different topologies in the flow behaviour. The first one corresponds to the presence of four regions, by varying alpha(0), namely low-density phase (LDP), intermediate-density phase (IDP), plateau current phase (PCP), and high-density phase (HDP). In the second topology, the intermediate-density phase disappears. The third topology presents only two regions, i.e., low- and high-density phases. For small values of a, the (IDP) and (PCP) disappear, respectively, by increasing b. When increasing a, the fourth topology, corresponding to one phase (HDP), appears for low values of b and b0.

Rev. E 68 066123) into the multi-lane model proposed by Daganzo (1997 Transpn. Res. B 31 83) with the consideration of the coupling effect between the vehicles of two lanes in instantaneous traffic situation and lane-change effect. In the novel model, the coupling effect of two lane and phenomena simulation shows that it is in accordance with real traffic flow. This obviously indicates that the new phenomenon and behaviour are analogous results as single lane presented by Xue, and the proposed model is more reasonable on two lanes. Furthermore, the generation rate between two lanes is also investigated. The results show that the formation and diffusion of traffic shock wave can be better simulated on two lanes.

Estimating human exposure to transport noise in central Dublin, Ireland	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Noise pollution; Noise exposure; Noise and health; Noise abatement; GIS; Traffic management; Dublin	TRAFFIC NOISE; SLEEP; ANNOYANCE; STRESS	This paper reports on research conducted to determine estimates of the extent of environmental noise exposure from road transport on residents and workers in central Dublin, Ireland. The Harmonoise calculation method is used to calculate noise values for the study area while a Geographical Information System (GIS) is utilised as a platform upon which levels of noise exposure are estimated. Residential exposure is determined for L(den) and L(night) while worker exposure is determined for L(den). In order to analyse the potential of traffic management as a noise abatement measure, traffic was redirected from the main residential areas to alternative road links and the revised exposure levels were determined. The results show that the extent of noise exposure in Dublin is considerable, and in relative terms, it is worse for the night-time period. In addition, the results suggest also that traffic management measures have the potential to lead to significant reductions in the level of noise exposure provided that careful consideration is given to the impact of traffic flows on residential populations.

Personal Exposure to PM10 Among Bus Drivers in Sari, Iran	INDOOR AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Indoor; PM10; Personal exposure; Bus driver	PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION MODES; COMMUTER EXPOSURE; AIR-POLLUTION; PARTICULATE; PM2.5; MORTALITY; URBAN	Personal exposures to PM10 were measured at the breathing zone in bus drivers' during 30 days of one calendar year over 6 routes in Sari city centre. The mean exposure of the drivers to PM10 was higher in autumn and winter than measured in spring and summer. Exposures to PM10 during high traffic flow in the evening were considerably higher than those measured in the morning and afternoon. The numbers of passenger on the bus, bus model and ambient temperature were found to have a significant effect on exposure to PM10. Penetration of outdoor particulate air pollution and re-suspension of suspended fine particles in the bus were most probably the main sources of the bus drivers' personal exposure to PM10.

J	Mercier, M				Mercier, Magali			Traffic flow modelling with junctions	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Hyperbolic systems of conservation laws; Continuum traffic flow model; Riemann problem	CONSERVATION-LAWS; BOUNDARY-CONDITIONS; HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS; INTERSECTIONS; WAVES	Motivated by the modelling of a roundabout, we are led to study the traffic on a road with points of entry and exit. In this note, we would like to describe the modellisation of a junction and solve the Riemann problem for such a model. More precisely, between each point of discontinuity we use a multi-class extension of the LWR model to describe the evolution of the density of the vehicles, the 'multi-class' approach being used in order to distinguish the vehicles after their origin and destination. Then, we treat the points of entry and exit thanks to special boundary conditions that give bounds on the flows of the different types of vehicles. In the case of the one-T road we obtain a result of existence and uniqueness. This first step allows LIS to obtain a similar result for the n-T road. We describe these results and also some properties of the obtained Solutions, in order to see how long this model is valid. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We use this model to study the traffic dynamics at highway bottlenecks either caused by the restriction of the number of lanes or by on-ramps or off-ramps. The coupling conditions for the Riemann problem of the system are applied in order to treat the interface between different road sections consistently.

J	Gunay, B				Gunay, B.			Rationality of a non-lane-based car-following theory	PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-TRANSPORT			English	Article						developing countries; roads & highways; traffic engineering	MODEL	Earlier work by the author developed a two-dimensional car-following model by taking into account the lateral discomfort experienced between the neighbouring vehicles moving in the same direction. This incorporation of lateral friction in car-following theory may offer a potential breakthrough in the field of microscopic simulation. However, that model was based on a small-scale scrutiny in which the interactions between only two or three vehicles were analysed in isolation. The treatment of the problem with many vehicles in a stream of traffic, say, on a link, was not made. The present paper, therefore, develops a simulation model with various types of vehicular interactions, including lane changing, and performs certain verification checks. The results show that the simulation behaves rationally giving credibility to the approach introduced. Although a number of comparisons with empirical observations are made in the paper, complete validation and experimentation are left for further work. Furthermore, the paper draws research attention to the area so that various existing car-following models can be modified in a similar way to mimic non-lane-based car following in multilane traffic flow. Potential practical implication of the work for traffic engineers is mainly capacity assessments especially in places where the discipline of lane-based-driving is weak.

J	Pavlis, Y; Recker, W				Pavlis, Yannis; Recker, Will			A Mathematical Logic Approach for the Transformation of the Linear Conditional Piecewise Functions of Dispersion-and-Store and Cell Transmission Traffic Flow Models into Linear Mixed-Integer Form	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						mathematical logic; conditional piecewise functions; dispersion-and-store model; cell transmission model; mathematical programming	OPTIMIZATION; FORMULATION; WAVES	The modeling of traffic control systems for solving such problems as surface street signalization, dynamic traffic assignment, etc., typically results in the appearance of a conditional function. For example, the consistent representation of the out flow discharge at an approach of a signalized intersection implies a function that is conditional on the signal indication and the prevailing traffic conditions. Representing such functions by some sort of constraint(s), ideally linear, so as to be considered in the context of a mathematical programming problem, is a nontrivial task, most often resolved by adopting restrictive assumptions regarding real-life process behavior. To address this general problem, we develop two methodologies that are largely based on analogies from mathematical logic that provide a practical device for the transformation of a specific form of a linear conditional piecewise function into a mixed integer model (MIM), i.e., a set of mixed-integer linear inequality constraints. We show the applicability of these methodologies to transforming into a MIM virtually every possible conditional piecewise function that can be found when one is modeling transportation systems based on the widely adopted dispersion-and-store and cell transmission traffic flow models, as well as to analyzing existing MIMs for identifying and eliminating redundancies.

J	Xu, M; Gao, ZY				Xu, Meng; Gao, Ziyou			Chaos in a dynamic model of urban transportation network flow based on user equilibrium states	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS			English	Article							STABILITY; FORMULATION; COMPUTATION	In this study, we investigate the dynamical behavior of network traffic flow. We first build a two-stage mathematical model to analyze the complex behavior of network flow, a dynamical model, which is based on the dynamical gravity model proposed by Dendrinos and Sonis [Dendrinos DS, Sonis M. Chaos and social-spatial dynamic. Berlin: Springer-Verlag; 1990] is used to estimate the number of trips. Considering the fact that the Origin-Destination (O-D) trip cost in the traffic network is hard to express as a functional form, in the second stage, the user equilibrium network assignment model was used to estimate the trip cost, which is the minimum cost of used path when user equilibrium (UE) conditions are satisfied. It is important to use UE to estimate the O-D cost, since a connection is built among link flow, path flow, and O-D flow. The dynamical model describes the variations of O-D flows over discrete time periods, such as each day and each week. It is shown that even in a system with dimensions equal to two, chaos phenomenon still exists. A "Chaos Propagation" phenomenon is found in the given model. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Up to now vehicular interfaces have mostly been evaluated from a single-driver single-car viewpoint, however, driving is a more complex task involving - beside the local interaction - the interrelationship between all the cars in a certain community of interest. The question investigated in this research work is how a vehicle's local parameters in a bulk of cars (e.g. vehicle speed, braking parameters) affect the global behavior of this system (traffic congestion, driving speed variation, throughput). To explore this, two traffic models have been developed and simulated using the NetLogo simulation environment. Simulation results have shown that the intercar distance has a direct impact on both the throughput and the mean trip time. The proactive driving approach using vibro-tactile driver notification followed in the second, advanced model achieved much better results regarding these parameters compared to the simple manual-driven case. Finally, the outcomes legitimate the implementation of a prototype, and the installation of such a technology into a large number of cars in order to provide evidence for the improved traffic flow and decreased probability of traffic accidents in real driving scenarios.

MODELING HETEROGENEOUS NETWORK USER ROUTE AND DEPARTURE TIME RESPONSES TO DYNAMIC PRICING	18TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY			English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory	JUL 16-18, 2009	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Structural Engn	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst		SOLUTION ALGORITHM; CHOICE; RELIABILITY; FORMULATION	The ability to realistically capture tripmakers' responses to time-varying road charges is essential for network equilibrium assignment models typically applied to predict network flows in the presence: of dynamic road (congestion) pricing. User responses to pricing are governed by individual tripmakers' preferences, such as their value of time (VOT), and the cost they attach to late vs. early arrival relative to the destination. These behavioral characteristics vary across users. This paper presents a joint route and departure time network equilibrium assignment model explicitly considering heterogeneous users with different preferred arrival times at destinations, VOT, and values of early and late schedule delays (VOESD and VOLSD). The model is formulated as an infinite dimensional variational inequality and solved by a column generation-based algorithmic framework that embeds (i) an extreme non-dominated alternative-generating algorithm to obtain combinations of VOT, VOESD, and VOLSD subintervals (or breakpoints) that define multiple user classes, and the corresponding least trip cost alternative (joint departure time and path) for each user class, (ii) a traffic simulator to capture traffic flow dynamics and determine experienced travel costs; and (iii) a multi-class alternative flow updating scheme to solve the reduced multi-class simultaneous route and departure time user equilibrium problem defined by a subset of feasible alternatives. Application to an actual network illustrates the properties of the algorithm, and underscores the importance of capturing user heterogeneity and temporal shifts in the appraisal of dynamic pricing schemes.

HETEROGENEITY IN CAR-FOLLOWING BEHAVIOR: THEORY AND EMPIRICS	18TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY			English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory	JUL 16-18, 2009	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Structural Engn	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst		TRAFFIC FLOW; MODEL	The aim of this paper is to gain insights into the level of heterogeneity in car-following behavior in real traffic. We use a large sample of trajectory observations collected by means of a helicopter to identify differences between the car-following behaviors of: (1) passenger car drivers, (2) passenger car drivers and truck drivers and (3) passenger car drivers following a passenger car and passenger car drivers following a truck. We thereto calibrate eight car-following models making different assumptions about the way in which drivers follow their leader(s) on the same lane. We show that considerable behavioral differences exist between passenger car drivers. Different passenger car drivers do not only consider different stimuli (like speed difference(s) with the leading cars I and distance headway(s) to leading car(s)) but also the extents to which these stimuli influence their behavior differ. Truck drivers turn furthermore out to adopt in general a more robust: car-following behavior than passenger car drivers. Their speeds show, for example, less variation over time. We also find indications that the desired headways of passenger car drivers are lower when following a truck than when following a passenger car.

COMPARISON OF TRAFFIC STATE ESTIMATION METHODS FOR LAGRANGIAN DATA	18TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY			English	Proceedings Paper	18th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory	JUL 16-18, 2009	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst, Ann Arbor, MI	Hong Kong Soc Transportat Studies, Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Civil & Structural Engn	Univ Michigan, Ctr Study Complex Syst		CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HIGHWAY CONGESTION; WAVES	Most of today's freeways are monitored using systems based on loop detectors embedded in the pavement, which collect data used to estimate the state of the traffic. However, these sensors are expensive, need maintenance and their reliability varies. When traveling on-board vehicles, cellular devices equipped with a Global Positioning System (GPS) chipset are able to accurately provide position and velocity of the vehicle, and therefore can be used as probe traffic sensors. Several. ways of using this source of data (speed or travel times) for estimation purposes can be found in the literature. However, the field of highway traffic flow estimation from probe data is still in its infancy. Moreover, methods to estimate traffic state using probe data have not been compared to each other and have not been assessed against loop detector based methods. The present article addresses this problem. For this purpose, it first presents two traffic state estimation methods to incorporate mobile probe measurements into highway flow models. Both techniques are used to reconstruct the state of traffic (density). The first method is an extension of a technique used in oceanography called Newtonian relaxation. The second method is based on Kalman filtering. Using loop detector data and GPS data collected from a field experiment performed in California, the state estimation performed with both methods is compared. The experiment was carried out on a stretch of highway 1880 in the San Francisco Bay Area, California, and involved 100 vehicles carrying GPS-enabled cellular phones driving repeated loops of six to ten miles in length continuously for eight hours. The results are promising, showing that the methods successfully incorporate the GPS data in the estimation of traffic. It is found that for high loop detector density (more than two per mile) the estimates are comparable with the ones obtained when less than 5% of the vehicles are equipped with GPS at the rate of one observation every 3 minutes. This confirms that GPS-enabled cell phones are a feasible alternative for traffic monitoring and traffic state estimation.

By statistical analysis of traffic data from the UK motorway network, we find that the functional form preferred for this does not have an explicit jam density that will induce zero speed in traffic. We deduce that it is zero speed that induces jam density in traffic rather than vice versa, so that the direction of causality between speed and density differs according to circumstances. We develop an approach to modelling traffic in light of this. We apply this to analyse speed control as a traffic management measure and show how it can be used to estimate the effect of speed management on road capacity.	[Heydecker, Ben G.; Addison, J.

In the approach, the acceleration and deceleration manipulations of drivers depend on the velocity of the subject vehicle n, the netto gaps and velocity differences between vehicle n and a range of the preceding vehicles from n-1 to n-m. We analyze the linear stability of the multi-anticipative intelligent driver model (MIDM) by introducing a small disturbance into the homogeneous traffic flow on a single lane with open boundaries. The induced neutral stability curve in the phase diagrams reflects the multi-anticipative behavior and shows that the stable region is a result of the collective effects of the desired time gap, the reaction time, the maximum acceleration, the maximum anticipative vehicles, the homogeneous velocity and netto gap, and so on. The traffic congestions can be suppressed by introducing the multi-anticipative interactions. The results of numerical simulation coincide with the theoretical linear stability analysis.

This method combines STARIMA model and Dynamic Turn Ratio Prediction model (DTRP) to enhance the forecasting performance and efficiency on urban intersections. To verify the Dynamic-STARIMA modeling method in real situation, an experimental model is constructed to produce forecasting traffic flow for part of urban network in Beijing, China based on actual data. The prediction accuracy of Dynamic STARIMA model is generally satisfying compared to other forecasting methods, which testifies the advantage and practicability of the proposed model.

Optimal Routing for Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems Using a Macroscopic Traffic Flow Model	2009 12TH INTERNATIONAL IEEE CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS (ITSC 2009)			English	Proceedings Paper	12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	OCT 04-07, 2009	St Louis, MO	Missouri Univ Sci & Technol Distance & Continuing Educ, Kansas City SCOUT, Missouri Dept Transportat, Kansas Dept Transport, Pinkley Sales, Traffic Control Corp, Hokuyo Automatic Co Ltd			MOTORWAY NETWORKS	We consider Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) consisting of automated highway systems on which intelligent vehicles organized in platoons drive to their destination, controlled by a hierarchical control framework. In this framework there are roadside controllers that manage single stretches of highways. A collection of highways is then supervised by so-called area controllers. We focus on the optimal route choice control problem for the area controllers. In general, this problem is a nonlinear integer optimization problem with high computational requirements, which makes the problem intractable in practice. Therefore, we first propose a simplified but fast simulation model to describe the flows of platoons in the network. This model is a modified version of the macroscopic METANET traffic flow model, adapted to the case of platoons. Next, we use this model in a model-based predictive control approach in order to determine optimal splitting rates at the network nodes. These splitting rates can subsequently be communicated to the roadside controllers, which translate them into actual route instructions for the individual platoons.	[Baskar, L.

This method does not require background estimation or even the identification and tracking of individual vehicles. It requires only the identification of each lane and the estimation of a bird eye view of the highway using a rectification method. To each rectified lane, an intensity profile is computed along the traffic flow direction for each frame, obtaining an image that represents the displacement as a time function. The main idea is to search for the best matching profile for different times and spaces on each lane and consequently obtain the velocity profile.

Given the velocity profile of an urban route as a function of space and time, we utilize a fluid model to characterize the general vehicular traffic flow, and a stochastic model to capture the randomness of individual vehicle From the fluid and stochastic models, we can acquire respectively the densities of the mean number of vehicles along the road and the corresponding distribution With the knowledge of the vehicular density dynamics, we determine the probability that the communication network is fully connected, i.e., each node can communicate with every other node through a multi-hop path, and the problem is also investigated for a general case of a k-connected network. To closely approximate the practical road conditions, we use a density-dependent velocity profile to approximate vehicle interactions and capture the shockwave propagation at traffic signals We confirm the accuracy of the connectivity analysis through simulations and show that the analytical results are good approximations even when vehicles interact with each other as their movement is controlled by traffic lights We also illustrate that system engineering and planning for optimizing connectivity in the communication networks can be carried out with the results in this paper	[Ho, Ivan Wang-Hei; Leung, Kin K.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England; [Ho, Ivan Wang-Hei; Polak, John W.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Ctr Transport Studies, London SW7 2AZ, England	Ho, IWH (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Elect & Elect Engn, London SW7 2AZ, England.

Novel Traffic Lights Signaling Technique Based on Lane Occupancy Rates	2009 24TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Proceedings Paper	24th International Symposium on Computer and Information Sciences	SEP 14-16, 2009	Guzelyurt, CYPRUS	Middle E Tech Univ		gaussian mixture model; cast shadow removal; convex hull fitting; convex hull mask; lane occupancy rates		In a conventional traffic lights controller, the lights either change at constant cycle times or at times proportional to the length of each leg of the intersection. Such approaches clearly are not perfect for optimizing traffic flow. Waiting times proportional to lane length may work well for a single-lane road but when roads with multiple lanes are considered the solution would not be optimal. The authors believe that an adaptive signaling based on fullness of each leg of the intersection would be a better approach. This paper presents the segmentation of foreground objects from frames of the surveillance video using an adaptive K-Gaussian mixture model and describes an approach for determining the lane occupancy rates for the north leg of the intersections. To give an accurate fullness measure the cast shadows that might be present in the segmented foregrounds are removed using a combined probability map called the shadow confidence score. Simulation results are provided for two standard and one custom recorded sequence.

To help solve the traffic congestion problem, a traffic advisory system is proposed to identify the threshold capacity of a road segment. Threshold capacity measures the number of vehicles which can be allowed to pass over a certain road segment without causing congestion. Threshold capacity is used for suggesting improvements of road segments. Congestion information can subsequently be provided to traffic management authorities for improvement of the conditions of road segments. The traffic advisory system is designed using fuzzy logic to determine the threshold capacity of a road segment. To estimate the tendency of traffic flow at different junctions a neural network is designed. Furthermore an algorithm is proposed, which measures the effects of these improvements. Testing of proposed system is accomplished through simulation.

Minimal error certificates for detection of faulty sensors using convex optimization	2009 47TH ANNUAL ALLERTON CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING, VOLS 1 AND 2	Annual Allerton Conference on Communication Control and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	47th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control, and Computing	SEP 30-OCT 02, 2009	Monticello, IL				HAMILTON-JACOBI EQUATIONS; KINEMATIC WAVES	This article proposes a new method for sensor fault detection, applicable to systems modeled by conservation laws. The state of the system is modeled by a Hamilton-Jacobi equation, in which the Hamiltonian is uncertain. Using a Lax-Hopf formula, we show that any local measurement of the state of the system restricts the allowed set of possible values of other local measurements. We derive these constraints explicitly for arbitrary Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We apply this framework to sensor fault detection, and pose the problem finding the minimal possible sensor error (minimal error certificate) as a set of convex programs. We illustrate the performance of the resulting algorithms for a highway traffic flow monitoring sensor network in the San-Francisco Bay Area.

In order to assess the synchrony of traffic flow between hub and road nearby, this paper analyzes the match between capacity and actual traffic volume. Finally, an evaluation about the hub service can be made. Take Hankou Train Station for a case study, we testify the feasibility of this method. The result can also provide the theory foundation for transport transformation and evaluation.

There are many factors that contribute to traffic congestion, however; there is one that plays a major role in giving rise to a phenomenon called "Traffic Waves", and that is driver behavior. Traffic waves also called "stop waves" or "traffic shocks", and they are travelling disturbances in the distribution of cars on a highway, which seems to appear without any reason, propagating backwards and severely slowing traffic flow on roads. The proposed research aims at reducing/eliminating traffic waves by integrating Artificial Intelligence, and Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET) to create a driver aid that helps in combating traffic congestion as well as embedding safety awareness by dynamically rerouting traffic depending on road conditions.

However, traffic signal control in urban road network will cause random delay on float cars, and this kind of delay will result in considerable fluctuation of travel time. Thus, the accuracy of FCD system is seriously affected. In this paper, float car refining models are proposed to calculate the stopped-time delay by means of low-sampling-rate FCD. And then, the classification of controlled delay and non-controlled delay is performed in order to remove traffic signal control's affection, and to obtain the data which can truly reflect the traffic flow characteristics. The contrast experiments indicate that the accuracy of the FCD system has achieved significant improvement after applying the new processing model.

Traffic flow and occupancy data from loop detectors is used for calibrating these models and specifying the inputs to the simulation. In addition, flow data from ramps are often found to be missing or incorrect. A model based iterative learning technique is used to impute these ramp flows by minimizing the error between simulated and measured densities. The simulation results using the calibrated parameters and imputed flows indicate good conformation with loop detector measurements.

Global optimization charge-depletion power management would be desirable. This has so far been hampered due to the a priori nature of the trip information and the almost prohibitive computational cost of global optimization techniques such as dynamic programming (DIP). Combined with the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), our previous work developed a two-scale dynamic programming approach as a nearly globally optimized charge-depletion strategy for PHEV power management. Trip model is obtained via GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling. The Gas-kinetic based model was used for the trip modeling in our previous study. The complicated partial deferential equation based model with several parameters needs to be calibrated had for implementation. In this paper, a neural network based trip model was developed for the highway portion, using the given data from WisTransPortal. The real test data was used for the training and validation of the network. The simulation results show that the obtained trip model using neural network can greatly improve the trip modeling accuracy, and thus improve the fuel economy.

Optimal Transmission Probabilities in VANETs with Inhomogeneous Node Distribution	2009 IEEE 20TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERSONAL, INDOOR AND MOBILE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS			English	Proceedings Paper	20th IEEE Symposium on Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications	SEP 13-16, 2009	Tokyo, JAPAN	IEEE, Tohoku Univ, RIEC, IEEE Commun Soc, Natl Inst Informat & Commun Technol (NICT)			WIRELESS NETWORKS; CAPACITY	In a Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (VANET), the amount of interference from neighboring nodes to a communication link is governed by the vehicle density dynamics in vicinity and transmission probability of terminals. It is obvious that vehicles are distributed non-homogeneously along a road segment due to traffic controls and speed limits at different portions of the road, the common assumption of homogeneous node distribution in the network in most of the previous work in mobile ad-hoc networks thus appears to be inappropriate in VANETs. To capture the density dynamics in generic urban routes, we utilize a fluid model to characterize the general vehicular traffic flow, and a stochastic model to capture the randomness of individual vehicles, from which we can acquire respectively the densities of the mean number of vehicles along the road and the probability distribution. With the knowledge of the vehicular density dynamics from the stochastic traffic model, we determine the throughput and progress performances of a routing strategy, and confirm the accuracy of the analytical results through simulations. The analytical model proposed in this paper serves as a fundamental building block for performance analysis of other transmission protocols and network configurations, we also demonstrate that the optimal transmission probability for optimized network performance can be found from our results, which provides insights into system engineering and protocol designs in VANETs.

We developed this model to study how these four different types of 4-way intersection affect road traffic flow & congestion in general and "travel time" in particular. In this paper, we focus in particular on the mathematical algorithm, on the model abstractions, and on the simulator architecture. We adhere as much as possible to the CA paradigm as a way of avoiding hard to detect inconsistencies that could invalidate the model and the results obtained by using it.

The vehicles' velocities and their longitudinal positions are adapted by means of a consensus algorithm. The vehicles' formations are modeled as a velocity dependend discretized road model which is represented as a Petri net.

NETWORK CELL ROUTING MODEL FOR CONTROL OF THROUGHPUT AND DELAY OF AIR TRAFFIC	2009 IEEE/AIAA 28TH DIGITAL AVIONICS SYSTEMS CONFERENCE, VOLS 1-3	Digital Avionics Systems Conference		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE/AIAA 28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference	OCT 23-29, 2009	Orlando, FL	IEEE Aerosp & Elect Syst Soc, Amer Inst Aeronaut & Astronaut, DATC			HIGHWAY; WAVES	Attempts to manage air traffic by either decreasing delay or increasing flow can have the reverse effect on the other. In the National Airspace System (NAS), flights typically depart at their chosen times, and flow management techniques are implemented in the air in an effort to maximize flow, which could lead to delay for individual aircraft. Other areas of the world allow flights to depart only at predetermined slot times knowing that there is a clear unobstructed path, leading to minimal delays but possibly underutilizing airspace. We propose a new approach in leveraging the highway cell transmission model (CTM) to the airspace in the form of a multi-objective optimization that trades between maximizing throughput and minimizing delay. The model is posed as a multicommodity traffic flow integer program where the constraints are relaxed slightly from the CTM to examine strategies for achieving optimal throughput and delay. In practice, the model is envisioned to initially run offline to determine a preliminary solution to the initial state of the system. Solutions for subsequent changes in actual state can be determined by running the model online for the incremental state change. Stochastic events such as convective weather clearing times or capacities can be included in the model to better see the benefits and impacts of pre-positioning traffic to take advantage of possible future clearing.

The road authority sets dynamic traffic-flow dependent tolls on some links in order to minimize its objective function, while the drivers choose their routes and departure times so as to minimize their own perceived travel costs, which include a travel time component, tolls, and penalties for deviation from their preferred arrival and departure times. The drivers' behavior is modeled using a dynamic user equilibrium model. We define the problem in a general form so that a wide class of objective functions for the road authority and a wide class of the dynamic traffic equilibria can be employed. We also discuss the problem properties. The problem to find optimal traffic-flow dependent tolls in a general setting introduced in this paper is NP-hard. One of the ways of tackling such problems is to use advanced heuristic methods. In this paper a neurosimulation-based approach is proposed, using the neurosimulator FAUN 1.0. The proposed solution method is illustrated on case studies with the so-called Chen network.

Rather than just deploying the XBL system, in this study, a new innovative dynamic bus lane (DBL) operation system which is expected to be more productive is initially introduced. Unlike conventional studies which are mainly focused on operational performance of buses, this study attempts to examine the influences on buses and adjacent traffic following the provision of both XBL and the new system. Impact measurements in terms of travel time and traffic conflicts changes are used as assessment indicators. Comparisons with the exclusive bus lane system as well as the mixed traffic flow are analyzed and highlighted through the application of micro-simulation approach. Simulation results showed that both XBL and DBL have positive impact on buses and negative impact on adjacent traffic. Traffic conflicts frequency will increase if either bus lane system is applied. Also it is found that DBL performs better than XBL in terms of achieving the goal of bus operation improvement while limited the performance deterioration to other vehicles and conflicts risks in a relative lower magnitude. Results also suggest the necessity of selecting the optimal strategies according to the tradeoff between the operational performance and safety performance under different traffic conditions.

Freeway Ramp PID Controller Regulated by BP Neural Network	2009 IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM, VOLS 1 AND 2	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium		English	Proceedings Paper	IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium	JUN 03-05, 2009	Xian, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE				A parameter adjustment method of PID controller with BP neural network is developed and applied to freeway on-ramp metering in this paper. Firstly, the objective of ramp metering is determined, and a traffic flow model to describe the freeway flow process is built. Then the learning algorithm of BP neural network for adjusting the proportional, integral and differential coefficients is formulated in detail. Based on the traffic flow model and in conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, an on-ramp PID controller regulated by BP neural network is designed. According to real-time traffic status, BP neural network is used to adjust the PID parameters dynamically in order to minimize the performance index defined in terms of the density tracking errors. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. The results show that the controller designed has good dynamic and steady-state performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway and thus avoid traffic congestion. This approach is quite effective to freeway on-ramp metering.	[Liang, X. R.; Fan, Y.

At present, acquiring traffic information depends mainly on road loop detector, but this method takes high cost and can only collect information within a small area. This paper puts forward a prototype of traffic flow mesuring based on inter-vehicle communication. In this system, every moving vehicle which is equipped with wireless communication module is also a moving sensor, it can collect various traffic information and transmit along the vehicle flow to the base station in real time. Such information can help the base station to measure the traffic flow on road. This paper presents a method of traffic flow mesuring based on vehicle distance in the prototype system and also establishes a simulation platform based on car-following model to confirm the effectiveness of the mesuring method.

The proposed SSP, a nonlinear function of vehicle velocity, uses both the information of vehicle's state and braking capacity to adjust the position and velocity of the controlled vehicle. String stability, traffic How stability and traffic capacity of the proposed policy are analyzed. The SSP can ensure vehicle string stability and it can also yield stable traffic flow and higher traffic capacity that are superior to the traditional Constant Time Gap (CTG) system. Especially in the high-density traffic conditions, the proposed new policy can provide higher traffic capacity to relief traffic congestion while the CTG policy fails to do so. In addition, traffic simulations show that SSP can ensure vehicle safety in hard brake and acceleration scenarios. The proposed new spacing policy is a promising alternative to the traditional CTG policy.

The use of ITS technology in speed management with real-time information of urban freeway is one of strategies to enhance road safety. This paper presents methods for prediction short-term traffic flow speed on Beijing urban freeway with real time information from inductive loops. The source data sets including traffic volumes,speed and occupancy which are collected 24h/day over several years on Beijing ring road. Traffic flow is divided into three statuses, including free flow, transition status and congestion according to occupancy. To achieve objective prediction results, wavelet technology is applied to de-noising process. The artificial neural network, which does not require any pre-defined underlying relationship between dependent and independent variables, is a powerful tool in dealing with prediction problems. In this paper, RBF network is designed for predicting speed for future five minutes. Results show that the proposed RBF network model produces reliable estimates of vehicle speed for three various traffic conditions, especially congestion condition.

The whole control structure is divided into the decision-making level and control level. Two new measurements are put forward which weigh traffic urgency degree and differentiate traffic flow states separately based on traffic demands. Two-way traffic control and one-way traffic control can be transformed into each other according to the urgency degree. Taking speed as a measure is based on the fact that the road section distance and intersection conditions are changeless and they are out of control. Such classical direction coordinated control strategy as synchronous and asynchronous coordinated control are impractical because of their limited use, that is, they require equal section lengths on arterials. The algorithm is based on our proposed one-way control method which changes the control aim timely depended on the vehicle queue length variation during the adjacent cycle and the relationship between the number of the arrival and departure vehicles in the same cycle. The experimental results demonstrate the method's ability to realize the running of the two-way traffic and indicate that the proposed discrete type performance index model is a more appropriate design for two-way traffic signal timing control.

A city is considered. Within the city region, commuters are assumed to be scattered continuously over the city and each commuter is assumed to choose a facility to minimize individual total cost. To make the model more realistic, travelers can either travel directly to the CBD on the continuum (surface streets), or they can travel on the continuum and then exchange at an interchange (ramp) before moving to the CBD on the discrete network. A solution based on finite element algorithm and Newtonian method is used to solve the model. A numerical example is given to simulate changes in the traffic flow intensity and customer volume of CBD and interchanges, when a new CBD is located in different position of the city. It shows that a new CBD can not only share customers of the existing CBD, but also attract customers to its nearby interchange.

This paper first introduces function and location of GRIPs for the urban freeway network in Shanghai, China. Second, it deals with the information display method of GRIP; Then, it proposes a macroscopic traffic flow model based simulation platform for investigating control benefits of GRIP. The simulation platform combines Papageorgiou's METANET model with the GRIP influence model. Next, control benefits of GRIP in terms of re-current congestion alleviation were examined on a hypothetical freeway network through a case study. Simulation results indicate that GRIP have a positive potential of reducing re-current congestions and facilitate more efficient use of road infrastructures. Last, Concluding remarks are given.

The Yager-Inference-Scheme-Based Fuzzy CMAC (FCMAC-Yager) architecture shows advantages such as it exhibits learning and memory capabilities of the human cerebellum through the CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) structure and the human way of reasoning through the Yager inference scheme. However, it suffered from an exponential increase in the number of identified fuzz), rules and computational cost arising from high-dimensional data. This diminishes the interpretability of the FCMAC-Yager network in linguistic fuzzy modeling. This paper proposes a novel rough set-based rule reduction (RSFCMAC) approach for the established FCMAC-Yager architecture. RSFCMAC algorithm used in the FCMAC-Yager network can help to provide better generalization, to reduce the number of fuzz), rules and computational cost. The proposed algorithm not only performs reduction of redundant fuzzy rules, but also carries out reduction of redundant input attributes. Experiments using real-world application involving stock movement and highway traffic flow prediction were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed RSFCMAC against the FCMAC-Yager network and other published results of cross-architectures using globalized learning as well as similar architectures employing localized learning. The results are encouraging.

The human cerebellum is a vital part of the brain system that possesses the capability to accurately model highly nonlinear physical dynamics. We can exploit our increasing knowledge of the human cerebellum to construct an intelligent computational model to effectively handle the complexity of nonlinear dynamic systems in the real world. This paper presents a novel brain-inspired computational model of the human cerebellum named the kernel density-based CMAC with Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy inference model (KCMAC-TSK) for fast and accurate nonlinear system identification. The structure of the KCMAC-TSK model is inspired by the neurophysiological aspects of cerebellar learning and development process. By incorporating a fuzzy model in KCMAC-TSK using kernel density estimation, we enhance the modeling capability, accuracy, and interpretability of the system. We applied the proposed KCMAC-TSK model in a challenging highway traffic flow modeling and prediction problem. Experimental results showed that KCMAC-TSK outperformed current modeling techniques, demonstrating the learning accuracy and effectiveness of KCMAC-TSK in handling complex nonlinear dynamic real-world systems.

The Cellular Automata (CA) have been configured for such modeling. The urban traffic models [2], in general, concentrate on low traffic density. The inabilities of traditional models to address the issues arise out of heavy traffic in crowded cities of third world countries are properly addressed in the proposed elementary CA based model. The effectiveness of the model is verified considering the traffic in Kolkata. It is established that the model can fairly reproduce various traffic conditions as found empirically.

One simple example is traffic congestion on roads. Reduction of these congestions will not only minimize time wastage but also lead to a healthier life. For this reason, various approaches have been taken to mitigate this problem. In this paper, a simulation approach is proposed to model and investigate the behavior of traffic flow on roads. This is due to the difficulty in obtaining exact solutions based on probability theory and queuing systems even for moderately complex systems. In this paper, the simulation technique used is based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. It is noticed that the result obtained shows that traffic behavior can be modeled accurately. Thus, this simple approach can be extended to other similar systems such as computer networks, communication systems, etc.	[Wong, Xin Ci; Ahmed, Syed Khaleel; Zulkifli, Fadhilah; Ramasamy, Agileswari K.] Univ Tenaga Nas, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Ctr Commun Serv Convergence Technol, Selangor 43009, Malaysia	Wong, XC (corresponding author), Univ Tenaga Nas, Dept Elect & Commun Engn, Ctr Commun Serv Convergence Technol, Selangor 43009, Malaysia.	xinciw@gmail.com; syedkhaleel@uniten.edu.my; fadhilah.zulkifli@tm.com.my; agileswari@uniten.edu.my	Ahmed, Syed Khaleel/C-2329-2011				Adams W.

The model framework used in this study developed using M/M/1 queuing theory. The principles and rules for the fuzzy control system are modeled based on the arrivals of vehicles, vehicles queue length at current green phase, and vehicles queue lengths at the other phases. The phase sequence and phase length extension are used in the decision making to switch the current phase to the appropriate next phase. Using the information from its traffic detectors at each of the four lanes of isolated intersection, the fuzzy rule-based system gives optimal signals to adapt the phase lengths to the traffic conditions. The phase sequence is managed by a simple program using if-else statement. In this paper, an isolated traffic intersection is simulated for both fixed-cycle traffic control system and fuzzy logic based traffic control system. The comparison of performance between the two models of traffic light system clearly indicates that the fuzzy logic based traffic lights control system is more efficient, flexible and adaptable in controlling the traffic flow.

Some traffic data from loop detectors settled in arterial streets are incomplete, and the importance of effectively imputing the missing values emerges. In this paper, a technique called least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is introduced to predict missing traffic now based on spatio-temporal analysis in urban arterial streets. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to apply the rising computational intelligence (CI) technique incorporating with state space approach in missing traffic data imputation. Having good generalization ability and guaranteeing global minima ensure its well performance in the area. A baseline imputation technique, expectation maximization/data augmentation (EM/DA), is selected for comparison because of its proved effectiveness in missing data recovery. Through persuasive comparisons of the techniques, the proposed model is proved to be more applicable and performs better in stability and adaptability, which reveals that it is a promising approach in missing data prediction.

Therefore, dynamic traffic signal control in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) recently has received increasing attention. This study devises an adaptive and cooperative multi-agent fuzzy system for a decentralized traffic signal control. To achieve this we have worked on a model which has three levels of control. Every intersection is controlled by its own traffic situation, correlated intersections recommendations and a knowledge base which provides its traffic pattern. This study focused on utilizing the prediction mechanism of our architecture, it finds most correlated intersections based on a two stage fuzzy clustering algorithm which finds most intersections effect on a specific intersection based on clustering membership degree. We have also developed a NetLogo-based traffic simulator to serve as the agents' world. Our approach is tested with traffic control of a large connected junctions and the result obtained is promising: The average delay time can be reduced by 42.76% compared to the conventional fixed sequence traffic signal and 28.77% compared to the vehicle actuated traffic control strategy.

This paper discussed the dynamic nature of urban intersections, and presents a novel traffic flow evolution model at a time scale and of a level of detail suitable for on-line estimation, simulation and control. The intersection is considered as interconnected components of urban road network. The macroscopic model proposed here extends the platoon-dispersion model by redefining inflow and outflow vectors, and by also specifying the control vector. Two variables were added to the model, i.e. the turning proportion and the lane assignment scheme. The turning proportion is an obvious variant, and yet the lane assignment is time-varying in some especial condition. Simple stochastic matrix equations described the macroscopic traffic behavior of each movement. This will allow the simulation of quite large road networks by composing many intersection models. The model is validated over real traffic data with abrupt changes in the demand of flow.

Bifurcation and chaos theory of nonlinear dynamical systems are used to calculate the complex nonlinear bifurcation and chaos phenomena in freeway traffic flow. The numerical simulations, including bifurcation diagrams and computation of the maximum Lyapunov exponent, show the rich and complex dynamical behavior and critical phenomena in traffic flow. This paper indicates that the critical bifurcation parameter where the state variables change suddenly can be considered as the maximum service flow of freeway under certain conditions.

According to the features that wireless sensor networks have no space constraints, flexible distribution, mobile convenience and quick reaction, we present a scheme that uses wireless sensor networks to monitor city transport vehicles and have designed a traffic monitoring system based on wireless sensor network that is applicable to all types of city environment. With the system, we can monitor the important roads that are easily blocked and find out the time changing law of traffic congestion, and then put the focus on monitoring them in order to greatly reduce the investment and achieve high efficiency. As far as the traffic flow forecasting methods concerned, we use Adaptive GM (1, 1) Model which have a real-time rolling forecast for city traffic and have a better forecast results. Because of the fewer study about the traffic congestion control in the current academia, we make a deep study about the traffic congestion control issues in this article. Learn from mature congestion control algorithm in computer network, we have designed an algorithm of traffic flow congestion control and scheduling for traffic network, which is called TRED.

A traffic flow model to describe the freeway flow process is firstly built. Based on the model and in conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, a fuzzy-PED ramp controller is then designed. The ramp metering rate is determined by the PED controller whose parameters are tuned by fuzzy logic according to the density tracking error and error variation. Gauss and triangle curves are used for the membership functions of the fuzzy variables. The rule base including 49 fuzzy rules is also established. Finally, the control system is simulated in MATLAB software. The results show that this controller designed has fast response, good dynamic and steady-state performance. It can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway, and can make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely. This approach is quite effective to freeway ramp metering.

The macroscopic traffic flow is adopted as the model of freeway, it is considered as connected by same distance segments; the traffic sensors are placed at the conjunction of these segments, their numbers are much less than the traffic state to be estimated. The compression state space is adopted, the model parameters is taken as traffic state to be estimated not constant value. An unscented particle filter (UPF) method is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy of real-time traffic state. The simulation results indicate that the unscented particle filter can increase the accuracy of the estimation in terms of the root mean square error(RAISE), compared with the Extended Kalman filter (EKF).

Then, based on Greenshields' model we construct dynamic discrete traffic flow model with the form of Logistic map and present dynamic analysis for this model. We take the occupancy as model variable and the ratio of free flow speed to average speed as the control parameters of the model. By controlling the constructed model parameters we theoretically analyze the different traffic flow condition and the producing and transformation mechanism of chaos for freeway traffic flow.

Then, it determines the invariable lane's attribute according to the detector data and proposes the signalized control method of invariable lanes. In order to avoid the traffic flow confusion at approaches because of the drivers entering into the wrong traffic lane when the lane's attribute is changed, paper lays out a fictitious stop line and proposed a pre-signal control method based on the fictitious stop line. The suggested strategy was verified with simulation software VISSIM. The results showed that this article method may enhance the road intersection traveling capability and reduces the delay by comparing with different channelization and control methods.

Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) is one perfect method for short-term traffic flow forecasting based on pattern recognition. At present time, the application research of NPR for short-term traffic flow forecasting is confined in small-scale fields and has less study of forecasting mechanism. This paper is trying to use the simulation measure to research the applicability of NPR in short-term traffic flow forecasting and study the forecasting principles by adjusting different system parameters. A typical road network is constructed as the study object in this paper. The forecasting problems of NPR are studied based on it. The data pre-processing of principal component analysis and cluster analysis are used for better forecasting results. Other network structures have only different simulation parameters with the presented network.

This inefficiency contributes to the increased cost of transportation while also contributing to the levels of pollution emitted as a result of human transportation needs; in addition to these detriments, this inefficiency also wastes the travelers' time. We strongly believe that Intelligent Traffic Light Control can significantly diminish waiting times before red traffic lights in a city and in the process can save our society billions of Dollars annually. To study the efficiency of current system and performance of any proposed system, there is a strong need for an accurate and lightweight simulator. While several traffic simulators have been developed under the Intelligent Transport System initiative, their primary focus has been on modeling and forecasting vehicle traffic flow and congestion from a queuing perspective. In this describe Lightweight Intelligent Traffic Simulator (LITS) being developed for studying different traffic control systems.

However, the classical forecasting method using the support vector regression (SVR) based on RBF kernel does not support online learning and has the problems of information loss, long processing time, low robustness and so on. An effective Marr Wavelet kernel which we combine the wavelet theory with AOSVR (MW-AOSVR) to construct for traffic flow forecasting is presented in this paper. The forecasting performance of MW-AOSVR is evaluated by real-time traffic flow data of southbound US 101 Freeway, in Los Angeles, USA and a variety of experiments are carried out. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach with Marr Wavelet kernel provides more optimal performance than that with radial basis function (RBF) kernel and has much more precise forecasting rate and higher efficiency, especially for boundary approximation.

In this paper, we study throughput in an IVC system along a unidirectional traffic for different traffic conditions and transmission ranges of wireless units. Here, whether a vehicle is equipped or not is random, and the probability is assumed to be the market penetration rate. We first briefly introduce the communication performance measures and our simulation platform based on network simulator 2 and traffic flow theories. We then present Monte Carlo simulation results of communication performance measures for traffic flows of two congestion levels, information source and destination at different distances, and three transmission ranges. We compare our results with those obtained through simple connectivity analysis and find that the results are consistent for low connectivity, but the throughouts by ns-2 simulations are significantly lower than the theoretical results, due to packet losses caused by signal interferences. Together with further investigations, the study could be helpful for determining and designing appropriate communication hardware and software and intelligent transportation applications.

In building decision tree models, input variables were multiple roads' traffic flow condition value at current time, while, target variable was a certain road's condition value at future temporal horizon from 5-30 min. The results showed that when all the predictors were input without feature selection, the classification accuracy obtained by CART algorithm was higher than the other three algorithms. While using CART and CHAID with feature selection, the accuracy showed lower but the obtained decision tree expressed more concise and understandable with fewer nodes, besides, by enlarging training samples to about 10 times of that before, the accuracy with feature selection is higher than that without feature selection.

This paper presents a new short-term freeway traffic flow prediction model based oil combined neural network approach. This model consists of two modules: a self-organizing feature map neural network and an Elman neural network. The former classifies, the traffic conditions in a day into six patterns, and the later specifies the relationship between input and Output to provide the prediction Value. The inputs of the Elman neural network model include three kinds of data: the several time series of the prediction location, the historic data of the predictive time interval in the same week-days, the time series of the adjacent location. The performances of the combined neural network model are validated using the real observation data from 3(rd) ring freeway in Beijing.

One way to design control strategies applicable in real time is to represent the vehicle flows with a hybrid dynamic model. In this context, Batches Petri Nets (BPN) and their extensions, are well adapted for the modeling of such systems as they intend to model variable delays on continuous flows by adding special nodes, called batch nodes, to the continuous and hybrid Petri nets. Using BPN with controllable batch speed, this paper studies a portion of the A12 highway in The Netherlands. This hybrid representation leads to the evaluation of several real time VSL control laws in accordance with the accumulation front of vehicles.

Atmospheric hydrogen variations and traffic emissions at an urban site in Finland	ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-HYDROGEN; H-2; SOILS; AIR	Atmospheric hydrogen (H-2) mixing ratios were observed over a one year period from summer 2007 to 2008 in Helsinki, Finland. Relatively stable background values of hydrogen were occasionally observed at the site, with minimum in October and maximum between March and May. High hydrogen mixing ratios occurred simultaneously with high carbon monoxide (CO) values and coincided with high traffic flow periods. Carbon monoxide and radon (Rn-222) were continuously monitored at the same site and they were used in estimation of the hydrogen emissions from traffic. The morning rush hour slope of Delta H-2/Delta CO was in average 0.43 +/- 0.03 ppb (H-2)/ppb (CO). After correction due to soil deposition of H-2 the slope was 0.49 +/0 0.07 ppb (H-2)/ppb (CO). Using this slope and CO emission statistics, a road traffic emission of about 260 t (H-2)/year was estimated for Helsinki in 2007.

The pursued general approach to the real-time adaptive estimation of complete traffic state in freeway stretches or networks is based on stochastic nonlinear macroscopic traffic flow modeling and extended Kalman filtering. One major innovative aspect of the estimator is the real-time joint estimation of traffic flow variables (flows, mean speeds, and densities) and some important model parameters (free speed, critical density, and capacity), which leads to four significant features of the traffic state estimator: (i) avoidance of prior model calibration; (ii) automatic adaptation to changing external conditions (e.g. weather and lighting conditions, traffic composition, control measures); (iii) enabling of incident alarms; (iv) enabling of detector fault alarms. The purpose of the reported real-data testing is, first, to demonstrate feature (i) by investigating some basic properties of the estimator and, second, to explore some adaptive capabilities of the estimator that enable features (ii)-(iv). The achieved testing results are quite satisfactory and promising for further work and field applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The internal model is inserted into the ILC law, which is different from the classical one. A dynamic linearization of the freeway macroscopic traffic flow model along the iteration axis and lifting technique arc used for theoretical analysis, which eliminate the needs for identical initialization condition and lambda -norm that are two fundamental ILC issues in the time domain. Intensive simulations show the superiority of this control strategy compared with the classical ILC.

We use the new model to study the effects of on-off-ramp on the main road traffic during the morning rush period and the evening rush period. Numerical tests show that, during the two rush periods, these effects are often different and related to the status of the main road traffic. If the amin road traffic flow is uniform, then ramps always produce stop-and-go traffic when the main road density is between two critical values, and ramps have little effect on the main road traffic when the main road density is less than the smaller critical value or greater than the larger critical value. If a small perturbation appears on the main road, ramp may lead to stop-and-go traffic, or relieve or even eliminate the stop-and-go traffic, under different circumstances. These results are consistent with real traffic, which shows that the new model is reasonable.

The density distributions of the stable state is presented for several cases, which illustrate the manner of the congestion. The relationship between the outflow rate and the total number of vehicles and that between the outflow rate and the density just before the bottleneck are both given. Comparing with the relationship that occurring in the granular flow,we conclude that the transition from the free traffic flow to the congested traffic flow can also be attributed to the abrupt variation through unstable flow state, which can naturally explain the discontinuities and the complex time variation behavior observed in the traffic flow experiments.

The ability to disseminate information in an ad-hoc fashion allows pertinent information to propagate faster through the network. In the realm of ITS, the ability to spread warning information faster and further is of great advantage to the receivers of this information. In this paper we propose and present a message-dissemination procedure that uses vehicular wireless protocols for influencing traffic flow, reducing congestion in road networks. The computational experiments presented in this paper show how an intelligent driver model (IDM) and car-following model can be adapted to 'react' to the reception of information. This model also presents the advantages of coupling together traffic modelling tools and network simulation tools.

The lower the velocity of a vehicle, the longer the lane-changing time. The simulations are carried out in the two-lane system and the on-ramp system. When the lane-changing time is taken into account, the maximum flux per lane is reduced in the two-lane system compared with the original two-lane model, and it is even lower than that of single-lane road when a lane-changing takes longer time; the capacity drop can be reproduced in the on-ramp system.

We developed this model to study how these four different types of 4-way intersection affect road traffic flow and congestion in general and "travel time" in particular. In this paper we describe the model and 4WayCA.exe, the traffic simulator software package in which the model has been implemented. We focus in particular on the model abstractions and on the simulator architecture.

Various models are developed to understand single-lane traffic, multilane traffic, lane-changing behavior and network traffic situations. However, the result of CA simulation can only be obtained after massive microscopic computation. Although, the mean field theory (MFT) has been studied to be the approximation of CA model, the MFT can only applied to the simple CA rules or small value of parameters. In this study, we simulate traffic flow by the NaSch model under different combination of parameters, which are maximal speed, dawdling probability and density. After that, the position of critical density, the slope of free-flow and congested regime are observed and modeled due to the simulated data. Finally, the coefficients of the model will be calibrated by the simulated data and the analytical solution of traffic CA is obtained.

Despite becoming a key policy requirement, no tool is yet available to measure the effectiveness of pedestrian facilities, particularly in terms of their interaction with pedestrian movements. In this study, we have developed a pedestrian simulation model based on cellular automata (CA) techniques. This model has Sufficient flexibility to measure the effectiveness of pedestrian facilities in terms of a level of service index based on their interaction with pedestrian movements. We investigated the model's ability to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of fence in a subway station, with the goal of reducing conflicting pedestrian movements in some highly congested areas.

As an enhanced version of pure FAR, (Furthest Away Replacement), the proposed scheme 1) replaces Euclidean distance by network distance in estimating the distance to a data item, 2) binds each cache item to a link in the target road network, 3) introduces a, directional weight to consider the directional tendency of current traffic flow; and finally 4) schedules the cache requests according to their angular locations to efficiently deal with the multiple pending requests. Simulation results, conducted using the real-life trajectory data obtained from a tracking system currently in operation, show that the proposed scheme can improve the cache hit ratio by up to 9.2 %, compared with FAR as well as that the proposed angle-based scheduling scheme can further improve the cache hit ratio by tip to 2.3 %.

Achieving this accuracy and quality requires that network-based roadway sensors are allocated in locations beneficial to traffic operations. However, with the budgetary restrictions most transportation agencies face, these roadway sensors cannot be placed as thoroughly as obligatory for ideal accuracy, requiring these agencies to select a limited number of installments that produce the most optimal results. In this article, a nonlinear integer program is proposed to optimally allocate point sensors along a one-directional freeway corridor, given that any pair of adjacent sensors can produce a benefit for bottleneck identification. The objective of this model is to optimize the accuracy of bottleneck identification subject to resource and monetary constraints. This model is nonlinear and, due to a non-differentiable function, genetic algorithm is applied to find a solution. We demonstrate that on a case study network with bottlenecks at unknown locations, the model successfully allocates sensors in a manner that optimizes bottleneck identification accuracy.

In this study, we propose an innovative methodology for such prediction. Because of the inherently direct derivation of travel time from speed data, the study was limited to the use of speed only as a single predictor. The proposed method is a hybrid one that combines the use of the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and a multilayer feedforward neural network with backpropagation. The EMD is the key part of the Hilbert-Huang transform, which is a newly developed method at NASA for the analysis of nonstationary, nonlinear time series. The rationale for using the EMD is that because of the highly nonlinear and nonstationary nature of link speed series, by decomposing the time series into its basic components, more accurate forecasts would be obtained. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method by applying it to real-life loop detector data obtained from I-66 in Fairfax, Virginia. The prediction performance of the proposed method was found to be superior to previous forecasting techniques. Rigorous testing of the distribution of prediction errors revealed that the model produced unbiased predictions of speeds. The superiority of the proposed model was also verified during peak periods, midday, and night. In general, the method was accurate, computationally efficient, easy to implement in a field environment, and applicable to forecasting other traffic parameters.

By sampling and analyzing the spatial-temporal trajectories of network constrained moving objects, NMOD-TFSA can get the real-time traffic conditions of the transportation network. The experimental results show that, compared with the floating-car methods which are widely used in Current traffic flow analyzing systems, NMOD-TFSA provides an improved performance in terms of communication costs and statistical accuracy.

Jamology is an interdisciplinary research of analyzing and solving these jams. In this study, vehicles, pedestrians, etc., are all regarded as self-driven particles, which are active particles and do not satisfy the Newton's laws in general. Dynamics of these particles are studied by using a rule-based model, i.e., cellular automata. In this paper, starting from the background of this research, a simple model, called the asymmetric simple exclusion process, is introduced as basis of all kinds of traffic flow. Then it is extended in order to account each traffic phenomenon in a realistic way. Comparison between theory and experiment shows that the models are able to capture fundamental features of observations.

At the University of Toronto's ITS Centre, a comprehensive ITS research and teaching program was initiated in 1998. One of the prime goals of the centre is to advance the state of art in traffic control and management. Over the past decade, researchers developed a set of traffic control and management components with an integrated vision in mind. This set includes computer systems for adaptive freeway incident detection, traffic flow forecasting, adaptive arterial signal control, adaptive freeway and corridor control, and a platform for live traffic data gathering, storing and dissemination. In this paper we give an overview of the vision and the overall system, identify its essential components developed to date, and briefly describe the technical background of each component together with quantitative performance analysis.

Reversible lane-based traffic network optimization with an advanced traveller information system	ENGINEERING OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						bi-level programming; discrete network design problem; reversible lane; advanced traveller information system; chaotic optimization algorithm; transportation management	DESIGN; EQUILIBRIUM; MODELS; ALGORITHMS	In the case of two-way traffic, there are two opposite-direction flows on every road and serious unsymmetrical flows exist in rush-hour periods. One of the primary methods used for handling this kind of traffic flow is the use of reversible lanes. Which and how many lanes should be adjusted are optimization problems. They can be treated as a network design problem, i.e. the optimal decision on the resource distribution of a street and highway system in response to a growing travel demand. This article studies a new form of transportation network design problem by performing the strategy of reversible lanes. In order to describe this problem, a bi-level programming model is given in which the upper level model is to make the total system cost and flow entropy minimum, while the lower level is a stochastic user equilibrium assignment with an advanced traveller information system. Finally, the numerical example shows that, by adopting the reversible lane and advanced traveller information system, the total system cost will be greatly reduced.	[Wu, J. J.; Sun, H. J.; Gao, Z.

Moving Car Observer (MCO) method of determining the journey speed can be illustrated by considering a stream of vehicles moving along a section of road of length L in such a way that the average number of vehicles q passing through the test section per unit time is constant. The stream can be regarded as consisting of flows q(1) moving with speed v(1), q(2) with speed v(2), etc. This study was conducted to determine the stream flow between UTM and Taman Universiti during peak hour. Since almost the civil servants in UTM live in and near Taman Universiti. The traffic was expected to be high during peak hour along that way. From the analysis of traffic flow in this study, there are much difference of value between MCO and manually count method.

Therefore, it is necessary for developing the current coupled system vibration analysis under certain vehicle stream into that under stochastic vehicle stream to solve the problem of analytical model and calculation effectiveness. Based on the traffic investigation, the main parameters of vehicle's type, heavy, separation space and velocity were analyzed to extract its statistical characteristics. A random traffic flow Simulation program (RTF) is compiled adopting Monte-Carlo method and MATLAB language and its toolbox, which firstly considering the four parameters including the type, heavy, separation space and velocity of vehicles. A state of the art three-dimensional dynamic model of the wind-vehicle-bridge coupling vibration under random traffic flow is presented, in which the effects of bridge deformation due to static wind loads, buffeting-induced bridge responses, vehicle-bridge coupling vibration, wind loads on vehicle, time-varying property of system, structural geometrical nonlinearity and aerodynamic nonlinearity are included. The systematic analysis is realized through the establishment of two sub-systems including vehicle and bridge, and the separation and iterative calculation of the two sub-systems. Moreover, the approach is coded to a dynamic analysis module RTFWVB, which can consider arbitrary number vehicles, multi-lanes and steering opposite. A cable-stayed bridge in China is finally selected as a numerical example to demonstrate dynamic interaction of the RTFWVB system.	[Han, W.

The traffic flow can be induced extra vibration in the soft deck and corresponding stayed-cable. As the life of bridges is long, knowledge of the recent, current and expected performance is confirmed for the estimation of structural safety index. Thus, structural dynamic characteristics are important indexes for the damage assessment of the structure in service life. The objective of this paper is to apply system identification techniques to analyze the measured data with normal traffic conditions by structural monitoring system installed upon Kao Ping Hsi cable-stayed bridge in Taiwan. The excellent agreement both the identified results from different traffic conditions indicates that the traffic flow Would not significantly change the natural frequencies of the cable-stayed bridge. However, the damping ratios are sensitive to the vibration intensity. The results will be used to study for the vibration-based health monitoring techniques.	[Chen, C.

To capture the long-term and in-situ bridge condition evolution without interrupting normal traffic service on a bridge, ambient vibration monitoring is usually performed, where the excitation on the bridge is neither controlled nor measured. In this case, a statistical description on the excitation characteristics is required. This paper presents an innovative approach to obtain traffic information by processing the traffic flow images and hence characterize the traffic excitation on a bridge by a stochastic model. This model enables a Bayesian updating procedure upon the parameters that represent the bridge structural integrity, utilizing information obtained both from vibration measurement and from traffic flow image processing to reduce the uncertainty in the assessment of bridge structural condition.

Such a conservation law admits many L-1. contraction semigroups, one for each so-called connection (A, B). Here we define entropy solutions of type (A, B) involving Kruzkov-type entropy inequalities that can be adapted to any fixed connection (A, B), and which imply the L-1 contraction property for L-infinity solutions. We outline the proof of convergence of a new difference scheme that approximates entropy solutions of type (A, B) for any connection (A, B) if a few parameters are varied. The scheme relies on a modification of the standard Engquist-Osher flux. Some numerical examples are presented.

Firstly, a macroscopic traffic flow model to describe the freeway flow process is built. Then the architecture and function of fuzzy RBF neural network are analyzed. In conjunction with nonlinear feedback theory, a PID ramp controller regulated by fuzzy RBF neural network is designed. According to real-time traffic status, fuzzy RBF neural network is used to adjust the PID parameters dynamically in order to minimize the performance index defined in terms of the density tracking errors. Finally, the controller is simulated in MATLAB software. Simulation results show that the controller designed has good dynamic and steady-state performance, and can achieve a desired traffic density along the mainline of a freeway. This approach is quite effective to the on-ramp control.

In this paper a hierarchy control strategy and genetic algorithm optimization for the coordinated ramp control are proposed. The macroscopic model to describe the evolution of freeway traffic flow is firstly built. Then the coordinated ramp control system is designed. There are two control layers in this coordinated control system: the coordination control layer to select traffic models, to adjust the model parameters, and to determine the desired traffic density in each freeway section according to the current traffic state; and the direct control layer to keep the actual values of state variables in the vicinity of the desired state points via PI controllers. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal PI parameters of the direct control layer.

With the model and the genetic algorithm the best scheme of signal timing can be obtained. Through a simulation experiment the application of the model and algorithm was illustrated. The cases of ignoring the restriction of saturation and minimizing the total delay of the key entrance lanes were also analyzed. The analysis results showed that the restriction of saturation should be taken into account and the target function should be constructed on the basis of minimizing the total delay of all entrance lanes of all phases so as to ensure correctness and rationality of the optimizing results.

The MCLWR model can remedy some deficiencies of LWR model including the two-capacity phenomenon, hysteresis and platoon dispersion. Considering the analytical expressions of the eigenvalues are difficult to obtain for more than four-class of road users, we utilize high-resolution central scheme proposed by Nessyahu and Tadmor, which requires little information of the eigenstructure. One can only estimate the upper boundary of the maximum of absolute eigenvalues. To demonstrate the performance of the presented method, we verify on the numerical examples that involve two-, five- and nine-class of road users.

But we know it can be avoided or lightened, if we can reliably estimate traffic congestion which will occur in a few minutes or occurred already a few minutes ago, and take prompt, effective traffic management measures in time. Traffic condition will be better. Therefore, in this paper we provide a predict method for traffic condition of road intersections. The key parameter model of the method is the "dispersion formula", and the data Calculated are all from the real-time traffic data. To verify the effectiveness, we have done a lot of experimental, and the results show that the error is smaller.

The reducing areas of lanes can reduce the areas which are occupied by vehicles. We will introduce dynamic space occupancy to perform these changes. Making dynamic space occupancy in highway traffic accidents and intervention traffic-flow wave model based on the theory of hydrodynamic traffic-flow wave, can improve the models. Therefore, the predictions for traffic accident can be more closely to the actual situations. Through the analysis of the interaction among intervention shock-wave, queuing wave, starting wave, dissipation wave, traffic-flow wave position and corresponding time model, intervention measures rescission time model, we can estimate the queue furthest upstream position, time of origin, the special critical points position and time of shock-waves that results from the incident.

But there occurs the blocking effect of the buses that stop within intersection area. Based on the traffic flow theory and probability theory, the signalized intersection capacity is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively with the consideration of the on-line bus stop which is at the near-side of the intersection. For the two different signal type of loading lane, the model of the adjustment factor for bus stop (f(bb)) is established. Then the study on the factors and its sensitivity analysis about the impact on the capacity due to the bus stop has been conducted. The results show that both the distance between the bus stop and intersection stop line and the arrival rate of the bus loading lane affect the signalized intersection capacity greatly, and there exists an optimum value of the combination of these two factors to the capacity.

Specifically, the simplified model that is studied is related to part of a highway, on which the hazmat traffic can flow from one entrance. The control variables are represented by the number of vehicles that are allowed to enter the highway during a specific time interval, while the state variables are the queue of vehicles before the entrance, the number of vehicles in the various tracts of the highway, and the number of vehicles that enter the tunnel. The objective function to be minimized is characterized by three main terms: the queue, the hazard over the road, and the hazard related to the tunnel.

Nowadays, microscopic model approaches have been in the limelight for traffic researchers, because they allow for more precise descriptions of the physical road environment as computer power continues to increase. The microscopic simulators focus on individuals within the system and, not the overall extent of the flow. In this paper, we describe IMAGES, which is an intelligent multi-agent system based on microscopic model approaches using longitudinal and lateral models. The multi-agent concept is sufficient to represent drivers' behaviour and cars' features. IMAGES is able to use scenario-based, event-driven, and real-time-based traffic data. Through such a simulation, we estimated freeway traffic flows excluding and including on/off ramps, and we confirmed that unexpected incidents cause traffic congestion. However, data gathered from sensors (loop detectors, cameras, RFID, etc.) should be used much more. This paper is a foundation stone to be built upon; after generating or acquiring data via IMAGES, the next step is studying on the Data Stream Management System (DSMS), which deals with huge amounts of data in real-time.

In particular, we focus on the challenge of supporting potentially high-bandwidth commercial or infotainment communications between vehicles and the roadside in hotspots over several service channels, while concurrently enabling time-critical vehicle-vehicle communications for safety in a separate channel. In our architecture, within hotspots, the communication is aided by one of the access points in the hotspot. This access point is designated as the coordinating access point (CAP). Outside the hotspots, the communication is for safety only and is conducted in an ad hoc fashion. The CAP protocol design leverages IEEE 802.11 point coordination function (PCF) and distributed coordination function (DCF), which are modified for multichannel operation. The design objective is to maximize the utilization of the service channel that is used for nonsafety communications while meeting the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints of the safety communications. The performance of the IEEE 802.11 DCF and PCF and the CAP extension is quantified by simulation in NS-2. The mobility model represents a four-lane freeway at maximum vehicular traffic flow that is derived from the SHIFT traffic simulator. The CAP design is shown to significantly enhance the performance of safety and nonsafety communications.

Given the positions of each car at two recorded locations on a highway and the corresponding time instances, our approach can reconstruct the traffic flows (i.e. the dynamic motions of multiple cars over time) in between the two locations along the highway for immersive visualization of virtual cities or other environments. Our algorithm is applicable to high-density traffic on highways with an arbitrary number of lanes and takes into account the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constraints on the cars. Our method reconstructs the car motion that automatically minimizes the number of lane changes, respects safety distance to other cars, and computes the acceleration necessary to obtain a smooth traffic flow subject to the given constraints. Furthermore, our framework can process a continuous stream of input data in real time, enabling the users to view virtualized traffic events in a virtual world as they occur.

In order to study the nonlinear and strongly relevant micro traffic system, this paper applied hybrid system theory into micro traffic system model. One novel cellular automata NaSch traffic model based on hybrid system is built up. The traffic flow made up of lots of cars is a hybrid system. The driving behaviors of cars are continuous but the events that affect the cars speed are certainly or randomly discrete events. This paper analyzes the effect of driver switch behaviors to the whole traffic flow. The proposed novel traffic model is simple and easy to expand. This model can simulate the traffic states in the different traffic conditions correctly especially in some complex multiple lanes conditions. Simulation results tell us the presented adaptive traffic system model is correct and effective.

In Kamel et al. [2008] the concept of flatness-based control was applied to regulate the flow at the mainline section of the road on the traffic flow model LWR. This work was preceded by Abouaissa et al. [2006]. In this article we have proceeded the same way to set the flat output for a second order model METANET Unfortunately we were unable to prove that the system is flat and therefore define density as flat output, but we manage to define the control laws in order to respect constraints on density and queue length at the on-ramp. The idea is to express the control variable (the outflow of the on-ramp) according to the output (density or queue length at the on-ramp), then inject it in the system. We use this control method in the ramp metering case. The first aim of the control is to keep the density in the segment where the on-ramp is connected below a density (called the target density y(T)) for which we have the lowest TTS, and the second aim is to keep the queue length at the on-ramp below a maximum value. In order to evaluate the controller's efficiency and applicability, a comparison is made with traditional ALINEA based controller. We illustrate this approach by comparing the cases,no control' and 'ramp metering' for a simple network.

As of 2005, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had no effective approach for strategically managing a weather event that has been very disruptive to the national aviation system-large-scale thunderstorms that block the major flight routes in the northeastern United States. The operations research team that supports the FAA's efforts to provide innovations in air traffic management, led by researchers at Metron Aviation, Inc. and the Volpe Transportation Center, recognized the consequence of this operational deficiency and set out to resolve it. In this paper, we show how this team (1) developed and applied system-simulation models to quantify the extent of the traffic flow management problem and convey its magnitude to the FAA and to the aviation industry; (2) designed the Airspace Flow Program (AFP), a new approach to managing air traffic that could correct the problem within the limitations of a short development cycle and a change-resistant culture; (3) designed and developed an interactive simulation system that could be and was used to re. ne and perfect this concept prior to deployment by developing policies on the use of a decision support system; (4) engaged FAA and airline traffic management experts in a series of interactive exercises using the simulation system to develop the final software design, operational procedures, and decision rules for deployment and use; and (5) provided a clear and convincing postdeployment benefits assessment for the new traffic management approach. The deployment of this new capability was an enormous success that both the FAA and the airline community heralded widely. The postdeployment impact assessment showed benefits to the aircraft operators and the flying public of almost $190 million in 2006 and 2007, the first two years of use, compared to less than $5 million in design and development costs. Broader usage of AFPs and new applications for them show a projected 10-year benefit of approximately $2.8 billion.

Firstly, because of the complex modeling process and off-line prediction, differential method together with zero equalization in the data pretreatment and recursive least square method with forgetting factors in the parameter identification are used in establishing improved time-series prediction model. Secondly, as the difficulty in determining the initial value, the statistical method is used to generate initial value in modeling of Kalman filtering prediction model. Thirdly, because of the low speed of convergence in the BP neural network and the local minimum problem existing in the BP algorithm, RBF neural network is used in establishing the traffic volume prediction model. The results indicate that predictability of various models is confirmed, and the characteristic of individual models is also obtained.

The two common methods, i.e., with or without ramp lane, for modeling the on-ramp system are both adopted. The phase diagram and the capacity of the on-ramp system are studied in detail. Capacity drop is a common phenomena at traffic bottlenecks, especially at on-ramp. The simulation results show that the capacity drop becomes more serious as the cell size decreases. Considering that in cellular automata model the cell size directly determines the acceleration rate which is not very large in real traffic, we believe that lower acceleration rate is one of the main causes for capacity drop. In order to modelling the realistic traffic behaviors at on-ramp, an appropriate cell size should be selected.

Based on TFIG model and example of the region at the Southwest Second Ring of Being constructed by six roads, including three heavy traffic roads, and six intersections, we focus on the left-turn traffic jam in southbound of LA and propose the TFIG measures to guide part of them to branch roads: R.4 and/or R.5+R.6, and then take the advantage of the VISSIM software to simulate the regional traffic operation. The analysis of 9 different scenarios shows that left-turn traffic jam can be effectively mitigated: its travel times are saved by 18% 30%-31% 42%-46% and delays are reduced by 50-57s, 87-92s, 118-139s, respectively, when its guided flow ratios are 10% 20%, 30%. Meanwhile, one of R4.and R.5+R.6 is weak to affording the guided vehicles but two of them can not be taken lightly to optimizing traffic.

In MSTCA, the headway also could be used for lane changing, and then the length for safety criterion would be extended a lot. Lane changing region and first cell for lane changing on the other lane could be located. The situation while there are successive vehicles satisfies both the safety criterion and the motivation for lane changing; vehicles ahead would own lane changing priority. Both the two factors will influence the frequency of lane changing; eventually affect the total traffic flow. Simulation results show that the MSTCA could acquire higher value of flux and reproduce more realistic features of the mixed traffic flow.

Results indicate that the mean variation of particle and gaseous concentrations followed the traffic flow rate, evidencing the occurrence of PM10 concentrations greater than the respective air quality limit.

Street-based topological representations and analyses for predicting traffic flow in GIS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Street-based topological representation; Space syntax; Topological analysis; Traffic flow; GIS	NETWORK ANALYSIS; URBAN STREETS; MOVEMENT	It is well received in the space syntax community that traffic flow is significantly correlated to a morphological property of streets, which are represented by axial lines, forming a so called axial map. The correlation co-efficient (R 2) approaches 0.8 and even a higher value according to the space syntax literature. In this paper, we study the same issue using the Hong Kong street network and the Hong Kong Annual Average Daily Traffic datasets, and find surprisingly that street-based topological representations (or street-street topologies) tend to be better representations than the axial map. In other words, vehicle flow is correlated to a morphological property of streets better than that of axial lines. Based on the finding, we suggest the street-based topological representations as an alternative GIS representation, and the topological analyses as a new analytical means for geographic knowledge discovery.

To facilitate the evacuation of the EV, some additional lane-changing rules (pull over of ordinary vehicles) are introduced in a two-lane cellular automata model for traffic flow in highway. We find that this pulling over of ordinary vehicles promotes a faster moving of the EV in traffic flow and minimize the EV's impact on the overall traffic.

It views the variation of the gap between two consequent vehicles as a Markov process whose stationary distribution corresponds to the observed gap distribution. This new model provides a microscopic simulation explanation for the governing interaction forces (potentials) between the queuing vehicles, which cannot be directly measurable for traffic flow applications. the agreement between empirical observations and simulation results suggests the soundness of this new approach.

A Numerical Tool for Estimating Pollutant Emissions and Vehicles Performance in Traffic Interruptions on Urban Corridors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION			English	Article						numerical model; queue length; stop and go; traffic interruptions; vehicle emissions		The principal objective of this research was to develop and apply a traffic and emission decision support (TEDS) tool to urban highway corridors. This model simulates traffic while predicting time elapsed, energy consumed, and pollutants emitted to the atmosphere by vehicles on the corridor. Because emissions from internal combustion engines are very high during speed-change cycles, congested stop-and-go traffic can be very detrimental to local levels of pollution. Thus, the research was mainly focused on the existence and quantification of effects for local singularities (or traffic interruptions), such as pay tolls, roundabouts, and traffic signals within the corridor. This approach yielded a numerical predictive model, based on experimental measurements and concepts of traffic flow theory, which explains the interaction between the system operational variables of each traffic interruption and the environmental and traffic performance variables. In particular, the focus was on carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitric oxide, and hydrocarbons emissions and their relation to queue length and stops. The proposed traffic and emission estimation models provide an overall pollution estimate for a traffic interruption under any control configuration and traffic demand pattern.

Based on a five-day collection of the vehicle load samples passing through the exit of Guangyuan to Shahe of the North-Ring Highway in Guangzhou and on the existing statistic data of traffic flow and vehicle speed, a model is developed to simulate the actual traffic flow. New methods in extreme value statistics are used. i.e. threshold model and threshold point process. Then the Qiaole Bridge is taken as an example to show the maximum load effect distribution of the bridge under current traffic flow. Finally, for forecasting the load effect level of this in-service bridge in a future time period, maximum value distribution of bridge load effect in a time period is inferred. The example and analysis results prove that the assessment method proposed in this paper has comparative feasibility and validity.

In the view of this question, this paper presents an algorithm of vehicle flow measuring for the purpose of improving the accuracy of detection. At first, the background model is formed using Median method, and updating the model based on Kalman filter to enhance its robustness. Then, the moving vehicle is got from the difference between current frame and the background that is formed by the former step, and then the OTSU method has been chosen for the threshold segmentation to get the binary image of the moving vehicle. To avoid the inaccurate counts caused by vehicle shadows the shadow detection method based on HIS color space has been used to suppress the vehicle shadow, meanwhile, improved conversion formula between RGB and HIS is used to overcome the disadvantage of time consumption on computer At last, acquiring vehicle's count is based on virtual loop instead of virtual line detection technology. According to processing the actual traffic video, the experimental result indicates that the approach presented in this paper can meet real-time requirement, and the accuracy rises from 82.2% to 97.8% by using properly improved algorithm.

Due to the nonlinear and stochastic characteristic of traffic flow, it is difficult to predict traffic flow accurately. In order to improve the prediction precision, a combination prediction model based on rough set and knowledge entropy is proposed. The relative data model between prediction object and prediction model, and the decision table are established by means of converting continuous attribute values into discrete attribute values. Then the weight coefficients of the combination prediction model are determined by evaluating significance of every single prediction model with rough set and knowledge entropy theory, The proposed approach overcomes the limitation of the single prediction model, and makes the determination of weight coefficients more objective. Simulation results show the proposed combination prediction model outperforms any of the single prediction models.

Urban settlements can be viewed as a collection of street regulators acting like points of flow control. Cars are affected in their travel performance when queuing up through these traffic controllers. These flow regulators can be defined as an integrated system of interconnected models distributed all over the urban environment. The objective is to regulate the traffic flow in a fast and secure way. We propose in this paper an approach to integrate a GIS with an active sensory system in order to provide timely and accurate ITS forecast. Our efforts are oriented to predict accurate short-term traffic conditions and reliable long-term traffic forecast with the support of available ITS technologies.

Using linear stability theory, we find that lane-changing affects the stable region and the propagation speeds of the first-order and second-order waves. In analyzing a small disturbance, our model effectively reproduces certain non-equilibrium traffic-flow phenomena - small disturbance instability, stop-and-go waves, and local clusters that are affected by lane-changing. The model also gives the flow-density relationships in terms of the actual flow rate, the lane-changing rate, and the difference between the potential flow rate (the flow rate that would have occurred without lane-changing) and the actual flow rate. The relationships between the actual flow rate and traffic density and between the lane-changing rate and traffic density follow a reverse-lambda shape, which is largely consistent with observed traffic phenomena.

The new arterial control model can take into account delays of both major and minor streets and make real-time signal timing decisions with optimal two-way signal offsets, so as to create the best arterial signal operation performance. It has been developed to be an online real-time software for both simulation testing and field validation. Through simulation, it was found that the performance when operating this newly developed real-time arterial traffic-adaptive model was significantly better than when using the optimal fixed-time arterial timing plan. On the aspect of field testing, three signalized intersections located in East District, Tainan City, Taiwan were selected to be the test sites. Fairly good traffic control performance has been demonstrated in that it can effectively reduce travel delays of the control arterial as a whole. Additional discussions about how to combine travel delay and the total number of vehicle stops into a new control performance index have also been included to make the new traffic-adaptive model more flexible and reasonable to meet the expectations of different driver groups in the arterial system.

Composition of traffic flow and noise measurements were conducted near the main streets and national highways that cross the districts. GIS and statistical software SPSS 12.01 were used for the data analysis. The study results showed that mean noise level near the main streets was 70 dB(A) in the daytime, - 68.6dB(A) in the evening and at night it was 61.1 dB(A) in Eiguliai, and in Silainiai it was 67 dB(A), 65 dB(A) and 58 dB(A), correspondingly. On the highways, crossing the districts, heavy vehicles compose about D times higher part of total traffic flow during the day and about 2 times in the evening compared to other main streets. The noise level depended on the traffic flow and correlation coefficient fluctuated from 0.77 to 0.85. The modelling of traffic flow showed, that the increase of trucks proportion by 2 percent would increase the traffic noise by 1.1 dB(A) in the streets with traffic flow of 300 veh./hour or more, and by 1.8 dB(A) with traffic flow of 200 veh./hour or less. Our findings suggest that the influence of heavy vehicles on acoustic pollution is higher in the districts with lower traffic flow.

Traffic mortality and the role of minor roads	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Habitat fragmentation; Mitigation; Road ecology; Traffic and road characteristics; Traffic-calmed area	BADGER MELES-MELES; VEHICLE COLLISIONS; POPULATIONS; MITIGATION; FRAGMENTATION; TERRESTRIAL; MANAGEMENT; LANDSCAPE; PATTERNS; TURTLES	Roads have large impacts on wildlife, as they form one of the principal causes of mortality, and disturbance and fragmentation of habitat. These impacts are mainly studied and mitigated on major roads. It is, however, a widespread misconception that most animals are killed oil major roads. In this paper, we argue that minor roads have a larger impact on wildlife with respect to habitat destruction, noise load and traffic mortality. We use data on traffic related deaths in badgers (Meles meles) in The Netherlands to illustrate that traffic mortality is higher on minor roads. We ask for a more extensive investigation of the environmental impacts of minor roads. Moreover, we argue that the success of mitigation oil roads drastically increases when both major and minor roads are integrated in the planning of traffic flows. Therefore, we propose a strategy based oil the concept of a "traffic-calmed area". Traffic-calmed areas create opportunities for wildlife by decreasing limitations for animal movement. We ask for further Studies to estimate what size traffic-calmed areas should be to maintain minimum viable animal Populations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An algorithmic methodology was developed for incorporation and enhancement of the existing South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) evacuation analysis system. Analysis of the existing system's input data helped determine the specific model needed. Investigation included a series of traffic analysis algorithms that consider: 1) identification of prevalent traffic flow conditions during a predetermined time window, 2) recognition of incident occurrence, 3) incident characterization, and 4) subsequent routing. The algorithmic methodology initially developed by Sheu (2002) was considerably expanded and adapted to the available SCDOT traffic data. This modified approach was then incorporated into a general system design document to establish definitions and descriptions of the proposed enhanced system. This initiative will provide traffic officials with relevant insights and expertise to detect and characterize emergency situations. It represents a significant improvement over the labor-intensive traffic monitoring systems currently used by many state DOTs, which lack automated capabilities for incident detection and characterization.								*AASHTO, 2004, POL GEOM DES HIGHW S; AHMED SR, 1982, TRANSPORT RES REC, V841, P19; Chassiakos Athanasios P., 1993, TRANSPORT RES REC, P8; Coifman B, 2002, TRANSPORT RES A-POL, V36, P899, DOI 10.1016/S0965-8564(01)00046-5; Gall A.

Enhancing Predictions in Signalized Arterials with Information on Short-Term Traffic Flow Dynamics	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Neural Networks; Traffic Flow; Short-term Prediction; Pattern-based Prediction	NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; MODELS; QUEUE	Short-term traffic flow predictions are an essential part of intelligent transportation systems. Previous research underlines the difficulty in systematically assessing the predictability of traffic flow near capacity or during congested conditions. In this article a neural network prediction scheme is proposed that is consistent with the pattern-based evolution of traffic flow and has the capability of exploiting past information to acquire knowledge on the traffic dynamics in order to enhance predictability. Findings indicate that pattern-based predictions are more accuratein the traffic flow regimes consideredwhen compared to other local and global prediction techniques that operate under the time-series consideration. The pattern-based prediction scheme was also found to outperform the other methods tested in the knowledge of the anticipated traffic flow state in all traffic flow conditions considered.

Impacts of Sensor Spacing on Accurate Freeway Travel Time Estimation for Traveler Information	JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traveler Information; Traffic Management; Freeway Sensor		Travel-time estimation is a critical ingredient for transportation management and traveler informationboth infrastructure-based and in-vehicle. Infrastructure managers and operators are interested in estimating optimal freeway sensor density for new construction and retrofits. Focusing on freeway travel time estimation for display on roadside variable message signs, this article describes a concept developed from first principles of traffic flow for establishing optimal sensor density. The method is based on computing the magnitude of under- and overprediction of travel time during shock passages when using the midpoint method. Two case studies are presented considering representative traffic dynamics situations. Along with other performance metrics, a suggested aggregate measure developed from vehicle-hours traveled (VHT) is described for a reasonable range of detector densities. Extensions of the method to account for both recurrent and nonrecurrent congestion are included. Finally some suggestions for future research are described.

The proposed system applies the signal control concept to regulate the vehicles passing the work zone area at a lane-by-lane basis and offers an effective way to maximize the operational efficiency as well as safety. Introduction of the preliminary configuration and principal components associated with the proposed LBSM control contribute the core of this study. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, this study has also conducted extensive simulation experiments, based on a freeway simulator calibrated with real-world work zone data. The experimental results show that under heavily congested traffic conditions the LBSM can outperform all existing control strategies with respect to the work zone throughput, the average vehicle delay, the average stop delay, and the average number of stops. This study has also investigated critical traffic flow related factors that may impact on the performance of such a system.

Improved Flow-Based Travel Time Estimation Method from Point Detector Data for Freeways	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							VEHICLE REIDENTIFICATION	Travel time is an important parameter in evaluating the operating efficiency of traffic networks, in assessing the performance of traffic management strategies, and as input to many intelligent transportation systems applications such as advanced traveler information systems. Travel time can be obtained directly from instrumented test vehicles, license plate matching, probe vehicles etc., or from indirect methods such as inductance loop detectors. Because of the widespread deployment of loop detectors, they are one of the most widely used inputs to travel time estimation techniques. There are different methods available to calculate the travel time from loop detector data, such as extrapolation of the point speed values, statistical methods, and models based on traffic flow theory. However, most of these methods fail during the transition period between the normal and congested flow conditions. The present study proposes several modifications to an existing traffic flow theory based model for travel time estimation on freeways, such that the model can estimate travel time for varying traffic flow conditions, including transition period, directly from the loop detector data. Field data collected from the I-35 freeway in San Antonio, Tex., USA, are used for illustrating the results. Automatic vehicle identification data collected from the same location are used for validating the results. Simulated data using CORSIM simulation software are also used for the validation of the model.

The regulations and laws of European Union and Lithuania emphasize the importance of noise reduction, environmental issues, necessity to collect and disseminate information related to traffic flow, use of traffic flow mathematical models and their implementation for noise evaluation. In this paper, urban traffic noise is measured at streets and roads intersections that is characterized by high traffic flow rates and dominating noise at low frequencies. It is determined that the LA,, levels continuously decrease till the end of the green traffic signal cycle. Mathematical methods are applied to determine the noise intensity. The methodology used allows to estimate noise levels in a city using data provided by the automated traffic flow registration system.

One might have to wait for a traffic light to turn green at an inlet-section where there is no car on the cross street. Or, there may be a lot of cars on the cross street that must be cleared it? order to make the traffic flowing. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent traffic controller model to coordinate a network of traffic lights such that the flow of the traffic is maximized and the time of the traffic flow is minimized. We proposed to develop a model that implements multi-agents and fuzzy controllers on a network of computers. In the model, we created two types of agents, communication and computation agents for each traffic light at an intersection. In order to validate our model, we created a simulation test bed utilizing a cluster of computers where each node on the cluster represents traffic lights at an intersection. The simulation test bed also allows us to perform comparisons of our model to the other models.

This technique does not require background estimation or even the identification and tracking of individual vehicles. On the other hand, it requires the estimation of virtual images that represent a bird eye view of the scenario. This is achieved estimating an homography assuming that each lane on the image is parallel on the ground plane. To each rectified lane, an intensity profile is computed along the traffic flow direction for each frame, obtaining an image that represents the displacement as a time function. The main idea is to search for the best matching profile for different times and spaces on each lane, consequently obtaining the velocity profile.

Except road network design and traffic flow dispatching, scientific road orientation is one effective approach to solve this problem, too. Also, because of the appearance of many cloverleaf junctions and viaducts, current city transportation network system has been very complex, and can't be depicted by planar graph any more. It is important to establish the standard to decide which kind of orientation is good in non-planar network So, from the viewpoint of equilibrium, this paper put forward the definition of reasonable orientation for non-planar road network in city transportation system, and gave its mathematical programming model. To solve this problem, one heuristic algorithm based on three-dimension guillotine cut technique was advanced. A numerical example demonstrates that this algorithm is efficient.

The macroscopic model to describe the evolution of freeway traffic flow is built and the PSO algorithm is formulated. The control system is vertically decomposed into three layers: The adaptation layer to specify the values of disturbances and to adjust the parameters of traffic models, the coordination layer to determine the desired traffic density in each freeway section according to the current traffic state, and the direct control layer to keep the actual values of the traffic density in the vicinity of the nominal trajectories via PI control. PSO algorithm is used to find the optimal PI parameters of the direct control layer. Simulation results show that the control system is of good performance. It can eliminate traffic jams, maintain traffic flow stability, and make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely.

B	Blake, WK; Donovan, P			ASME	Blake, William K.; Donovan, Paul			A New Road-Side Array-Based Method for Characterization of Truck Noise During Passby	PROCEEDINGS OF NOISECON/ASME NCAD-2008			English	Proceedings Paper	Noise-Control 2008/Sound Quality Symposium/30th Annual Conference of ASME Noise Control and Acoustics Division	JUL 28-31, 2008	Dearborn, MI	ASME				This paper describes the development of a new method for measuring pass-by sound from trucks and other vehicles using 2-dimensional arrays. The approach provides 2-dimensional quantitative maps "images" of the cross-range and elevation distribution in the vehicle side view. The method is an application and extension of an array technology that was originally used for the characterization of static aeroacoustic sources in wind tunnels. The focus of this work is on identifying and rank-ordering the important contributing sources of passby noise. This development includes two phases: developmental testing at a test track site, and road-side testing at two California State highway sites. The acquisition post-processing allows the "observer" to track the vehicle cross-range in order to create a time sequence of source maps that may be interpreted as both level relationships and directivity patterns. The processing applies both range and approximate Doppler adjustments to spectra as a function of time during pass-by or, equivalently, to vehicle position relative to the array's center. An image demodulation scheme is shown to clarify the images. The initial phase of this work occurred at a test track using known "cooperative" truck sources. This experience permitted the verification of the method and the definition of a final measurement approach that was viable at a highway site. Subjects were all trucks that varied in model, vehicle speed, tread, and the presence of a trailer. The array beamformer's ability to localize and the measurement system's ability to track were validated using both stationary and moving sources. Following validation at the test track site, the instrumentation was transferred to two California highway sites. There, acoustic calibration was used to align the array with the road track and to provide a spatial reference for mapping the "images". Both light and heavy vehicles at these sites were "uncooperative" with arrivals and speeds randomly determined by traffic flow. This work was funded by the California Department of Transportation.

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are a promising means to help alleviate congestion by utilizing advanced sensing, computing, and communication technologies. This paper investigates a basic ITS framework - Advanced Traveler Information System (ATIS) - using wireless vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-roadside communication and assuming an ideal communication environment. Utilizing an off-the-shelf microscopic simulation model this paper explores both a centralized (CA) and decentralized (DCA) ATIS architecture. Results of this study indicate that an ATIS using wireless communication can save travel time given varying combinations of system characteristics: traffic flow, communication radio range, and penetration ratio. Challenges are also noted in relying solely on instrumented vehicle data in an ATIS implementation.

Presenting a model to car collision avoidance using Fluid Stochastic Petri net	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2009 WRI GLOBAL CONGRESS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS, VOL II			English	Proceedings Paper	1st WRI Global Congress on Intelligent Systems (GCIS 2009)	MAY 19-21, 2009	Xiamen, PEOPLES R CHINA	IEEE Comp Soc, IEEE Comp Soc, World Res Inst				In recent years road accidents have brought considerable death. The issue of safe road and safe car is one of the most important issues that are discussed nowadays in transportation area. One of the ways to decrease unpleasant accidents of traffic flows is to attract the attention Of vehicles to maximum speed and safe distance. The controlling system discussed here is based on discrete quantities like distance, speed and acceleration. The present paper is a typical compound system which uses a special kind of fluid stochastic Petri net (FSPN). FSPN includes a suitable formula for models and analysis of these systems. It is also a safe method to prevent car collision. FSPN is used for a controller displaying that creates three sub models of movement of three directly communicated cars and the main car calculates the allowable distance using the speed of front and back cars which is determined in network. When the distance of two successive cars is lower than the specific distance, it alarms the driver of main car at the danger of collision.

The potential benefits of studying coordination systems of traffic signal are already known in traffic flow analysis, modeling and traffic engineering design. However, presently there is a lack of information on coordination system on Malaysian roads. This study determines the coordination system pattern of traffic signal for four consecutive intersections spaced at 780 m distance. Data for vehicles movement were collected using video camera during morning and evening peak hour with congested conditions. A simulation model, TRANSYT7F, was used to evaluate the possible coordination of signalized intersections. For calibration TRANSYT7F results, delay, maximum back of queue and travel time practically were measured. The results show after coordinating, the amount of delay, travel time, and queue reduce.

Road Intersections Noise Impact on Urban Environment Quality	PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH WSEAS INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLIED AND THEORETICAL MECHANICS (MECHANICS '09)	Mathematics and Computers in Science and Engineering		English	Proceedings Paper	5th WSEAS International Conference on Applied and Theoretical Mechanics	DEC 14-16, 2009	Puerto de la Cruz, SPAIN	WSEAS		Noise Control; Acoustical Traffic Noise; Road Intersections; Predictive Software		Acoustical noise coming from road traffic is considered one of the most important noise source in an urban environment. Many studies have investigated the modelling of traffic noise, starting from experimental basis or from theoretical schemes. A topic still to be deeply investigated is the noise impact of road intersections and its optimization with respect to parameters such as traffic flow, vehicles average velocity, road typology, etc.. The aim of this paper is twofold: first of all the classification and the choice criteria of intersections are summarized; then the noise impact of different road intersections is investigated both on a review plan and on a software aided performance. The new idea introduced in this paper is to develop a "user friendly" tool for designers, able to produce noise maps easy to be read also by technicians that are not expert in acoustics issues, so that a designer could easily discriminate which typology of intersection better fits the area under investigation on the basis of a simple noise map or other graphical elements.

The objective of this work is to search global optimization techniques in order to optimize the parameters asociated to a two lanes emergent microscopic traffic model based on a cellular automata. The variables taken into account are: the car density ratio between the two lanes, the braking probabilities of each lane, and the mean and variance of the velocity distributions of each lane. This type of problem is known in the literature as a nonlinear global optimization problem with restrictions. Thus, a robust optimization algorithm able to calculate the global optimums in a reasonable number of function evaluations and to guarantee an adequate answer for any arbitrary set of flow data, is required. The proposed technique is a multistart type algorithm that combine a stochastic exploration of the domain and a heuristic calculation of a descent direction, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a local optimum. The efficiency of this algorithm is determined by the following criteria: (i) The number of the objective function evaluations, (ii) the execution time, and (iii) the quality of the final result. Among the advantages of the algorithm are the simultaneous localization of all possibles global optimums of the objective function and the low number of function evaluations with compared to other method reported in the literature.

Global optimization charge-depletion power management would be desirable. This has so far been hampered due to the a priori nature of the trip information and the almost prohibitive computational cost of global optimization techniques such as dynamic programming (DP). Combined with the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), our previous work developed a two-scale dynamic programming approach as a nearly globally optimized charge-depletion strategy for PHEV power management. Trip model is obtained via GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling. The main drawback was the dependency of external server for obtaining the macro-scale SOC profile, which makes it difficult to handle the impromptu change of driving decision. In this paper a computationally efficient strategy is proposed based on road segmentation and lookup table methods. Simulation results have shown its great potential for real-time implementation.

In the paper, a kind of adaptive prediction method for short-term traffic flow based on ANFIS (adaptive-network-based fuzzy interference system) model was presented. ANFIS is a fuzzy interference tool implemented in the framework of adaptive network. It combines the comprehensibility of fuzzy rules and the adaptability and self-learning algorithms of neural networks. The traffic flow prediction model with 104 changeable parameters will be established through the training process, the goal of which is reduce the prediction errors between real predicting output the ANFIS model and the desired output. The result of simulation research demonstrates that this method has the advantage of high precision and good adaptability. This scheme is novel and advanced in the domain of the road traffic flow prediction. The application of the scheme will remarkably improve the response efficiency and precision degree of the road traffic inducement and control system in our country.

Many city governors expect to alleviate the traffic congestion through constructing tunnels. The tunnel costs huge, and the traffic flows around the exit and entrance are complex. The traffic impact intensity and range need to be predicted before carrying out the item so that the traffic condition can be clarified. The current methods to ensure the traffic impact range have too many assumptions so that the accurate degree is low, and can't get the exact traffic impact intensity on the item peripheral roads. This paper introduces morphological analysis variable of the space syntax, draws on the method of computing accessibility, affiliates the trendency of the direction to the traffic volume resistance, and designs a easily operable model to assign the traffic volume and a method to ensure the aggressive influence range and negative influence range, according to tunnels' characteristics. At last, Hankou Tunnel in Nanjing is taken for example to carry out the empirical study. The result shows that the traffic impact intensity doesn't spread even from the traffic source, but relates to the topological depth and resistance of roads.

To the research on non-signal traffic circle systems, we define flow ratio as traffic density, and based on which, stop signs and yield signs are set up at traffic circles for the purpose of traffic control. The location of traffic lights and interval between red and green are determined reasonably according to the Twice Control Model for Signalized Intersections. The superiority of Twice Control Model for Signalized Intersections in current situation is tested by the empirical equation of delay time at signalized intersections. After coordinating green light interval between circle-lane phases, vehicle can pass continuous lights, and the waiting time on the road is shortened. At last, we improve our model in protecting for non-motorized, and also offer a method for calculation capacity of multi-lane.

Most of them calculate gas emission through the values of speed and acceleration in a standard urban driving cycle. Some other models consider the elementary component of vehicles movement, in order to characterize pollutants emission. In these models, speed is usually the kinematic variable considered, but sometimes acceleration is needed to describe changes over time. The model proposed in this work is made of a Dynamic Link Loading (DLL) model and an emission model. The DLL model is a mesoscopic one, and is part of a wider model, relevant to transportation networks, based on two submodels: the link model, proposed here, and the node model, for which the research is still in progress. The proposed model allows calculating explicitly speed and acceleration of the vehicles and, therefore, can be used favorably to our aim. In this work, to calculate vehicles' emission we used a model based on real driving conditions, rather than on driving cycles simulated in laboratory. An integrated model is used to calculate flow propagation along the bridge on Bosphorus, in Istanbul (Turkey), and pollutant emission and diffusion at the exit of the bridge. The bridge has 3 lanes for each direction, plus a reversible lane. It is 4 km long, and its capacity is 9000 vehicles/hour; we assumed its maximum density equal to 600 vehicles/km. The explicit calculation of vehicles cinematic parameters, like speed and acceleration/deceleration, through the proposed DLL model brings to more precise results in the simulation of traffic pollution phenomena. In fact, the most effective emission models require as input the acceleration, which the most common dynamic loading models usually do not calculate in an explicit way. On the contrary, the proposed integrated model calculates directly vehicles' speed and acceleration. Results can be easily used to simulate different scenarios and to estimate their performances. Consequently, it is possible to take effective planning interventions to control traffic flow, and reduce pollution, therefore approaching the system optimum.

After a careful traffic flow and periodicity qualitative and quantitative analysis carried out on field, the Authors built a simulation model through system dynamics, to study the route critical conditions as well as to asses the impact generated by the new configuration. The built model, as checked using different measuring tools, among those fixed camera posts, precisely detected the traffic conditions causing abnormal increases of run times and allowed to show the inefficiency of the proposed alternative route. The model permitted also not only to detect the factors causing the traffic anomalies bringing to the same route run time dilatation but also to show the resulting improving interventions.

Model of air traffic in terminal area for ATFM safety analysis	SAFETY, RELIABILITY AND RISK ANALYSIS: THEORY, METHODS AND APPLICATIONS, VOLS 1-4			English	Proceedings Paper	European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL)/17th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Risk-Analysis-Europe (SRA-Europe)	SEP 22-25, 2008	Valencia, SPAIN	European Safety & Reliabil Assoc (ESRA), Soc Risk Anal Europe				Air transportation system is understood as a set of elements (pilot, aircraft, air traffic control, ground ATC devices etc.), that are related to each other. Those relations are examined to check system's possibility to fulfil air transportation tasks. The safety of the vehicles involved in the transport process is one of the most important criteria for its assessment. There are many factors which contribute to that safety, including technical reliability of the means of conveyance, traffic organisation, qualifications and abilities of people who operate the vehicles and supervise the transport process, etc. The main problem Air Traffic Services encounter during realisation of their tasks is excessive congestion of aeroplanes in the airspace. This congestion is especially well visible in terminal areas. In the paper the role of Air Traffic Flow Management (ATFM) unit in unloading this congestion and in air traffic safety was shown. Then the main steps of the method for determining airport capacity were examined. The method was used not only for calculating current airport capacity, but also for preparing some prognoses of future capacities of the airport. Probabilistic analysis of these prognoses was given. On this base some propositions of methods (algorithms) of co-operation between ATC and ATFM services were proposed.	[Skorupski, J.; Stelmach, A.

In the common traffic flow theory, macroscopic flow model and data presentation shows chaos and stochastic distribution. However, in the microscopic based traffic model, it is revealed that in high frequency sampled test, the variables such as flow, density, and lane usage have common trend of U shape in daytime, e.g. high in peak time and low in off-peak time. Based on the traffic database of cross-river channel in LuJiaZui, PuDong, Shanghai, the statistics method is used for different sampling frequency to validate the mean, standard variance, and kurtosis. The variant ratio is used to analyze the first order negative correlation among high frequency sampled traffic data. The result shows the models (e.g. ARMA model) used in low frequency sampling data cannot directly apply to high frequency samples. In order to validate the U shape distribution of traffic data in daytime, the wavelet based nerve network is used for the analysis of 'calendar phenomena' of cross-river tunnel traffic.

We introduce a new viewpoint, the so-called rotation solutions, which in case of an additional symmetry leads to Ponies-on-a-Merry-Go-Round-solutions (POMs) [D. G. Aronson, M. Golubitsky, and J. Mallet-Paret, Nonlinearity, 4 (1991), pp. 903-910]. This approach, which is also useful for the case without road works, opens the possibility of analytical and numerical bifurcation studies, which show a wide variety in the possible dynamics of this very simple model. In addition, we mimic different measurement approaches and recover the famous inverse Greek. structure in the fundamental diagram.

The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated based on simulation results on the microscopic traffic simulation software PARAMICS and comparison with the local feedback controller ALINEA. The paper concludes that iterative learning control based ramp metering can drive the density of traffic flow to track a reference output in the presence of unknown but repeated disturbance.

Indeed, stochasticity is more and more widespread in traffic flow models. On one hand, microscopic models try to reproduce inter-vehicular deviation through stochastic algorithm. Distributions are sources of randomness. Even if many articles discuss the need for a certain number of simulations to obtain reliable results, they seldom if ever suggest a way to determine this number. Different simulations runs can produce various results due to a randomly assignment of desired speed of each car for example. On other hand macroscopic models have no individual parameter. This can prevent them from representing some traffic phenomena as roundabout insertion; lane-changing; various desired speed ... Stochasticity can overcome those weaknesses. Recently [1] presents a microscopic Lagrangian solution of LWR model allowing individual fundamental diagram. Thereby, numerous runs have to be computed to estimate the mean value of a measure of effectiveness (MOE) but also to test if the results come from a particular stochastic process. The knowledge of the whole distribution allows us to determine every percentile needed (for example the 5% worse situations). The aim of this paper is to propose a way to identify such distributions and to estimate the minimal number of replications that: one should make to obtain a given confidence level. We will focus on car-following component of models while lane changing, insertion (ramps, roundabout), and assignment will not be considered. However the proposed methodology can be applied to any components of traffic models.

To each particle is associated a jump rate, and the particular dynamics that we choose (based on 3-sites patterns) ensures that clusters of occupied sites are of uniform jump rate. When this model is set on a circle or an infinite line, classical arguments allow to map it to a linear network of queues (a zero-range process in theoretical physics parlance) with exponential service times, but with a twist: the service rate remains constant during a busy period, but; call change at renewal events. We use the tools of queueing theory to compute the fundamental diagram of the traffic, and show the effects of a condensation mechanism.

We study highway bottlenecks within the macroscopic BVT model. The BVT model describes traffic flow as a hyperbolic system of balance laws. It generalizes the traffic model of Aw, Rascle and Greenberg by introducing in the momentum equation a new source term, which can become negative due to the finite reaction and relaxation times of drivers. The model is capable of reproducing multivalued fundamental diagrams, the metastability of free traffic flow at the onset of instabilities and wide moving jams. Based on previous work we describe the coupling conditions for the Riemann problem of the system and apply them to highway bottlenecks. We focus our study on the situation where the bottlenecks are either caused by the reduction of the number of lanes or by on-ramps or off-ramps. Our numerical simulations reproduce the appearance of synchronized flow at these highway bottlenecks. The analysis of the lane reduction setup shows that the outflow from the synchronized flow region in front of the bottleneck is constant and below the maximum free flow. This observation can be understood from the study of the static solutions within the model. As a consequence of the coupling conditions static solutions have to cross the jam line, one of the additional equilibrium solutions within the BVT model. This crossing determines the flow value of the static solution.

Examples of such models are the social-forces type models for car-following behavior [1], the IDM (Intelligent Driver Model) and its modifications [2], and the MOBIL model [3] describing lane-changing behavior. Although these models can describe many phenomena in motorway traffic flow operations, a clear behavioral foundation has however been lacking so far. This contribution puts forward a new generic theory of driving behavior, based oil the principle of least effort. In this theory, drivers are assumed to minimize the predicted subjective perceived effort of their control actions, including for instance acceleration towards the free speed, car-following and lane changing. In this game-theoretic approach, drivers may or may not anticipate the reactions of the other drivers on their control decisions. Also non-cooperative and cooperative driving rules can be incorporated using the flexibility of the modeling approach. In this contribution, we present the main behavioral assumptions, the model derivation, and the resulting car-following and la,ne changing models for the noncooperative case. The workings of the model will be illustrated by means of a simple example.

Vehicles on road are treated as particles hopping on a lattice. In the morning rush hours, downtown parking lots are taken as the sinks for vehicles moving from suburban; in the afternoon rush hours, the parking lots become the sources for vehicles moving out of town. The traffic is regulated by the operation of a series of traffic lights on each street block. Both the traffic flow (from global perspective) and the travel time (from personal perspective) are studied. It is found that even in maintaining the same traffic flow, the tuning of traffic lights can significantly affect the travel time, and correspondingly the duration of rush hours.

The flow-density, diagrams are obtained and three different traffic density regions, i.e., undersaturated traffic, saturated traffic and oversaturated traffic, are observed. While in the small cycle time four traffic density regions appear. Further it is found that mean traffic flow and mean velocity strongly depend on the cycle time of traffic lights. An application of the signal model oil optimizing traffic lights in order to enhance the global throughput is studied. All the results indicate that the presented model is reasonable and has realistic meaning.

Vehicle make and model identification using vision system	TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL			French	Article						Pattern Recognition; Vision; Multiclass recognition; Voting Algorithm	RECOGNITION	Vehicule make and model identification Many vision based Intelligent Transport Systems are dedicated to detect, track or recognize vehicles in image sequences. Three main applications can be distinguished. Firstly, embedded cameras allow to detect obstacles and to compute distances from the equiped vehicle. Secondly, road monitoring measures traffic flow, notifies the health services in case of an accident or informes the police in case of a driving fault. Finally, Vehicle based access control systems for buildings or outdoor sites have to authentify incoming (or outcoming) cars. Rather than these two systems, the third one uses often only the recognition of a small part of vehicle: the license plate. It is enough to identify a vehicle, but in practice the vision based number plate recognition system can provide a wrong information, due to a poor image quality or a fake plate. Combining such systems with others process dedicated to identify vehicle type (brand and model) the authentication can be increased in robustness. This paper adresses the identification problem of a vehicle type from a vehicle greyscale frontal image: the input of the system is an unknown vehicle class, that the system has to determine from a data base. This multiclass recognition system is developed using the oriented-contour pixels to represent each vehicle class. The system analyses a vehicle frontal view identifying the instance as the most similar model class in the data base. The classification is based on voting process and a Euclidean edge distance. The algorithm have to deal with partial occlusions. Tollgates hide a part of the vehicle and making inadequate the appearance-based methods, In spite of tollgate presence, our system doesn't have to change the training base or apply time-consuming reconstruction process.

The quantum of an increase in the level of bus service due to the introduction of an exclusive bus lane was determined using a recently developed simulation model of heterogeneous traffic flow. The data on other factors (variables) that might cause modal shift from the auto-rickshaw to the bus was collected conducting a home-interview survey based on the stated preference approach. A binary logit model of mode-choice was then calibrated using the collected data and the model was also validated using a holdout sample. A mode-choice probability curve to depict the possible shift of auto-rickshaw users to the bus is developed taking difference in the travel times of two-modes as the basis to serve as a user friendly tool to analyze the possible modal shift for a wide range of the values of the involved variables.

The paper indentifies four basic components of a traffic network: a freeway corridor, signalized junction, traffic merging point (on-ramp) and traffic diverging point (off-ramp). The SCTM consisting of two cells with/without on-/off- ramps is defined as one basic subsystem of a traffic network. The four basic components of a traffic network are then built with this basic subsystem: A long freeway corridor is considered as a system cascaded by several basic SCTM subsystems. The on-/off- ramps are modeled as SCTM subsystems interconnected with the freeway SCTM subsystem. An isolated signalized junction is divided into several SCTM subsystems. Each of these subsystems consists of three phases according to the signal phases under some assumptions. Each of these subsystems accepts the means and variances of the stochastic travel demand and supply as exogenous inputs. The SCTM subsystems then produce the cell densities and outflow of the roadway segments in terms of mean and variance, accordingly.

The goal of congestion pricing is not only to mitigate traffic congestion during the most congested hours, but also to reduce environmental impacts of transportation. In this paper, a bi-level model is developed to optimize network flow in order to reduce traffic emission, by implementing congestion pricing. The function of gas emission with respect to link flow volume is established, and traffic flows are optimized to reduce network-wide traffic emission. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the effect of congestion pricing on reducing gas emission.

This enhanced model is tested using data obtained at the Lion Rock Tunnel, a busy trafficked tunnel for commuting in Hong Kong. On road measurement of vehicle pollutant emissions of CO was performed at Lion Rock Tunnel, Hong Kong in January 2007. Traffic flow, traffic speed and types of vehicle were measured at the same time. The estimations of CO emissions in gram-per-kilometer for three types of vehicles using this speed modified SMBM were compared to those estimated by simple mass balance model and piston effect model. We found that the speed modified SMBM was relatively simple and could yield estimates with no significant difference at 95% significance levels that of the piston effect model. This speed modified SMBM can be easily adopted to monitor the changes of vehicle emission factors over time.	[Mak, K. L.; Hung, W.

Many of the applications in Advance Traveler Information System (ATIS) and Advance Traffic Management Systems (ATMS) require an estimation and forecasting of the traffic conditions of the network. With a historical database of past traffic data from various types of vehicle detectors installed in the roads, real-time traffic information is collected which will be used to estimate the current traffic conditions and predict the condition in near future. Whereas most of the literature focused on the traffic flow prediction on the freeways, modeling traffic flow in urban arterials is more challenging as there are disturbances such as motorcycles and traffic signals in urban area. In this study, the traffic flow forecasting for urban arterials is investigated. Seasonal ARIMA and neural network are considered as the algorithms, and two arterials in the Taipei city, Taiwan, are studied in our numerical example.	[Hsieh, Ya-Chen; Wong, K.

Variable lanes system has been emerged as a control strategy to improve the capacity of road network. When traffic demand is directional asymmetrical in nature and the right-of-way is limited, variable lanes system can be used to manage traffic congestion. Used throughout the world, variable lanes control traffic on congested arterials and bridges by allocating roadway lanes to one direction or another by time of day. Remarkably, however, there has been little formal economic analysis of even the basic implementation of this control strategy. In this study, we investigate the economic efficiency of variable lanes, based on the time-varying-capacity bottleneck analysis model, and the system trip cost analytic model is derived. Moreover, congestion pricing and optimal lane allocation schemes are developed to manage and control traffic flow with asymmetric travel demand. Numerical examples show that the variable lanes control strategy is very efficient in reducing traffic congestion.

This is partially caused by blockage or closure of lanes, but also by the change of driving behaviour in the remaining lanes. This contribution analyses traffic flow conditions near an incident both microscopically and macroscopically. A theory is proposed to describe drivers' behaviour, which is tested using traffic data of individual vehicles, collected using a helicopter. A bimodal headway distribution is observed, centred around two mean values, 2 seconds and 4 seconds. To understand the underlying mechanisms a car-following model is fitted to the drivers' behaviour. The model parameters show that the reaction time is much higher than usual. Using this model-based analysis, we conclude that the incident distracts the drivers and less attention is paid to the driving process. The consequence is that the queue discharge rate for the unblocked lanes is 30% lower than the usual queue discharge rate per lane.

We show in this paper that such toll design approach is risk prone, which tries to optimize for the best-case scenario, if the UE problem has multiple solutions. Accordingly, we propose a risk averse SBTP approach aiming to optimize for the worst-case scenario, which can be formulated as a min-max problem. We establish a general solution existence condition for the risk averse model and discuss in detail that such a condition may not be always satisfied in reality. In case a solution does not exist, it is possible to replace the exact UE solution set by a set of approximate solutions. This replacement guarantees the solution existence of the risk averse model. We then develop a scheme such that the solution set of an affine UE can be explicitly expressed. Using this explicit representation, an improved simplex method can be adopted to solve the risk averse SBTP model.

In this paper, we present a new framework for analyzing the LWR model, especially the Riemann problem at a linear boundary in which the upstream and downstream links are homogeneous and initially carry uniform traffic. We first review the definitions of local supply and demand functions and then introduce the so-called supply-demand diagram, on which a traffic state can be represented by its supply and demand, rather than as density and flux as on a fundamental diagram. It is well-known that the solutions to the Riemann problem at each link are self-similar with a stationary state, and that the wave on the link is determined by the stationary state and the initial state. In our new framework, there can also exist an interior state next to the linear boundary on each link, which takes infinitesimal space, and admissible conditions for the upstream and downstream stationary and interior states can be derived in supply-demand space. With an entropy condition consistent with a local supply-demand method in interior states, we show that the stationary states exist and are unique within the solution framework. We also develop a graphical scheme for solving the Riemann problem, and the results are shown to be consistent with those in the literature. We further discuss asymptotic stationary states on an inhomogeneous ring road with arbitrary initial conditions and demonstrate the existence of interior states with a numerical example. The framework developed in this study is simpler than existing ones and can be extended for analyzing the traffic dynamics in general road networks.

J	Hawas, YE; Hameed, MA				Hawas, Yaser E.; Hameed, Mutahar Abdel			A multi-stage procedure for validating microscopic traffic simulation models	TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						microscopic models; traffic simulation; validation	NETWORKS	Validating microscopic traffic simulation models incorporates several challenges because of the inadequacy and rareness of validation data, and the complexity of the car following and lane-changing processes. In addition, validation data were usually measured in aggregate form at the link level and not at the level of the individual vehicle. The majority of model validation attempts in the literature use average link measurements of traffic characteristics. However, validation techniques based on averages of traffic variables have several limitations including possible inconsistency between the field observed and simulation-estimated variables, and as such the resulting spatial-temporal traffic stream patterns. Due to these inconsistencies, this paper introduces a novel approach to the validation of microscopic traffic simulation models. A three-stage procedure for validating microscopic simulation models is presented. The paper describes the field measurements, experimental setup, and the simulation-based analysis of the three stages. The purpose of the first stage is to validate a benchmark simulator (NETSIM) using limited field data. The second stage examines the spatial-temporal traffic patterns extracted from the benchmark simulator versus those extracted from the simulation model to be validated (I-SIM-S). Different traffic patterns were examined accounting for various factors, such as traffic flow, link speeds, and signal timing. The third stage compares the aggregate traffic measures extracted from the subject simulator against those extracted from the benchmark simulator.

J	Yang, F; Zhang, D				Yang, Fan; Zhang, Ding			Day-to-day stationary link flow pattern	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						Day-to-day traffic dynamics; Stationary link flow pattern; Deterministic user equilibrium	DYNAMIC USER EQUILIBRIUM; TRAFFIC ASSIGNMENT; NETWORK; STABILITY; GAMES; FORMULATION; INFORMATION; EXISTENCE; SYSTEMS; ROUTE	Day-to-day traffic dynamics aim at modeling driver's day-to-day learning and behavior adjustment process and providing insight on how the traffic flow pattern evolves over time. A number of continuous-time path flow dynamics have been proposed and studied in the literature whose stationary path flow pattern coincides with user equilibrium. However, the application prospects of these findings are limited by the fact that it might be difficult for transportation management centers to measure and monitor day-to-day dynamic path flow pattern. On the other hand, thanks to the fast development of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), the day-to-day link flow pattern can be more easily monitored and analyzed. Thus, it is not only of theoretical interest but also with implement viability to explore equilibrium in the perspective of link flow dynamics. This paper carries on the study originated by [Zhang, D., Nagurney A., Wu, J., 2001. On the equivalence between stationary link flow patterns and traffic network equilibria. Transportation Research, 35B, 731-748] in investigating the relationship between a stationary link flow (SLF) pattern and traffic equilibrium, and makes significant developments on the subject in the sense that we prove that five existing route choice adjustment processes in the literature are all special cases of a so-called rational behavior adjustment process (RBAP) and thus this RBAP is mild and reasonable and can serve as a general framework of modeling driver's rational behavior.

Modeling the Effects of Turn Delay Uncertainties on Route Choice Behavior in Signalized Road Networks	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							TRAFFIC EQUILIBRIUM; CAPACITY; DEMAND	Traffic flow fluctuation and traffic signal interruption result in turn delay variations at signalized intersections. Such variations can significantly contribute to road users' travel time uncertainties and affect their route choices in congested urban areas. A reliability-based stochastic user equilibrium (RSUE) model is proposed to investigate the effects of turn delay uncertainties on the route choice problem. In the proposed model, link travel times and turn delays are considered as correlated random variables with covariance relationships. Differences in these variables are mainly due to uncertainties at signalized intersections and day-to-day fluctuations in demand. Given these uncertainties, the concept of effective travel time is adopted to model the route choice behaviors of road users. The RSUE model also considers the perception errors of road users on effective travel times. A path-based solution algorithm is adapted to solve the RSUE problem. Finally, a numerical example illustrates the application of the proposed model and solution algorithm. Sensitivity tests are used to demonstrate the potential use of the proposed model to assess the accident risks at signalized intersections with heavy turning flows.

J	Song, GH; Yu, L				Song, Guohua; Yu, Lei			Estimation of Fuel Efficiency of Road Traffic by Characterization of Vehicle-Specific Power and Speed Based on Floating Car Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	88th Annual Meeting of the Transportation-Research-Board	JAN 11-15, 2009	Washington, DC	Transportat Res Board				To evaluate the fuel efficiency of road traffic, an approach that captures the characteristics of road traffic on the basis of floating car data (FCD) is proposed. In existing studies of fuel consumption, parameters such as speed, acceleration, and power demand have been adopted to represent the characteristics of traffic flows and vehicle activities. However, they are not suitable for use in the evaluation of fuel efficiency in a dynamic traffic network with various advanced traffic management alternatives. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the data collected by portable emission measurement systems and FCD collected in Beijing, it was found that the time distribution in vehicle-specific power (VSP) bins, that is, the VSP bin distribution, can well represent fuel consumption per unit of time. Furthermore, the combination of the VSP bin distribution and the average travel speed in a network can represent fuel consumption per unit of distance. According to these findings, the paper develops a method for evaluating the fuel efficiency for road traffic on the basis of defined indicators of fuel consumption and fuel consumption at the most efficient speed. A comparison of the estimated indicators and the real values indicates that the proposed approach performs well in evaluating the fuel efficiency of road traffic. This approach was applied to develop the temporal distribution of fuel efficiency for the West 2nd Ring Road in Beijing. Finally, the paper provides recommendations for expansion of this study by including more vehicle types and different rates of penetration of FCD.

Life-Cycle Cost Approach to Infrastructure Cost Calculation and Allocation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								A forward-looking approach to infrastructure cost calculation is presented. The approach assumes a semiprivate infrastructure operator to determine user charges. The calculated tariffs provide an incentive for the operator to maintain and develop further the road network in a sustainable manner. The approach subdivides the road infrastructure network into its individual structures and calculates the asset value of each structure separately. Unit prices for structures are calculated on the basis of information pertaining to the construction cost of recently completed infrastructure investment projects. It is assumed that maintenance and investment decisions are undertaken before the prediction of traffic flows in such a way that influenceable life-cycle cost is minimized. The cost for each user generation is allocated to different user categories on the basis of the principles of cooperative game theory, reconciling fairness and efficiency criteria. The principles of life-cycle cost analysis guarantee that the developed approach is compatible with cost-benefit analysis, engineering design guidelines, and the International Accounting Standards. Compared with traditional infrastructure cost calculation methods, the developed approach allocates a lower percentage of costs to heavy goods vehicles and higher fees to the first user generations.

There are usually two lanes at a Chinese curbside stop: a nonmotorized lane and a motorized lane. Bus stops are often located on the nonmotorized lane. When a bus dwells at a curbside stop, nonmotorized vehicles, mainly bicycles, will move to the motorized lane. Thus, the presence of a stopped bus creates a temporary conflict between bicycles and cars, reducing road capacity. A road capacity model based on gap acceptance theory and queuing theory is presented for mixed traffic flow at the curbside stop. Traffic conditions are classified into two types: no stopped bus and presence of stopped bus at the curbside stop. The probabilities of no bus and presence of bus at a stop can be obtained by using the queuing model of bus streams. Under the former condition, the bicycle stream and the car stream have no conflict, and car capacity is not affected by the bicycle stream. Under the latter condition, the conflict between bicycles and cars on the motorized lane leads to an effect on car capacity by the bicycle stream. The effect on car capacity can be derived through gap acceptance theory. Car capacity at the curbside stop is a function of three types of traffic stream-buses, cars, and bicycles-and it may be applicable in traffic analysis and the design of bus stops in other developing Asian cities.

Selecting sites by ranking them simply by crash counts or crash rates is a common practice of transportation agencies because only crash data are required. Although the empirical Bayes (EB) method is a better option for site selection than this simple ranking method, the EB method requires additional data that might not be readily available or up to date, such as on annual average daily traffic and roadway characteristics, and this requirement could subsequently hinder the implementation of any EB method. This research, sponsored by the Georgia Department of Transportation, is motivated by the need to develop a more effective site selection method. The contributions of this paper include (a) proposing a Poisson distribution-based wavelet shrinkage site selection (WASSS) method that can incorporate various wavelet shrinkage methods; (b) obtaining a superior wavelet shrinkage method, the Bayesian Multiscale method (BMSM), for WASSS by evaluating various wavelet shrinkage methods; and (c) comparing the EB method and this proposed WASSS method. It is found that the proposed BMSM-based WASSS method, as compared with the EB method, produces slightly better (or at least the same) level of performance (i.e., in terms of rates of false negatives and false positives); in addition this proposed method does not require additional data (as does the EB method). This study demonstrates that the proposed WASSS method is a promising site selection alternative that requires only crash data and that performs acceptably.

J	Gou, JZ; Zhang, L; Altman, JC; Davis, W				Gou, Jizhan; Zhang, Li; Altman, Jeffrey C.; Davis, Will			QuickZone Improvement for Rural Freeway and Model Validation	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This review indicated that in QuickZone 2.0 a deterministic queuing model is applied to calculate the delays for oversaturated conditions; stochastic and speed reduction delays were not included. Data collected from rural freeways in Mississippi show that saturated and oversaturated traffic flow may not occur in work zones. For situations like this, the delay components that are not included in QuickZone are significant. The current delay model of QuickZone needs improvement. This paper describes a model improvement made to QuickZone. The improvement considers delays from the deceleration before a work zone, slow-moving traffic along the work zone, acceleration after the work zone, and stochastic delays within the work zone area. The Excel Visual Basic Application implementation of the model in QuickZone is discussed in this paper. Traffic flow parameters such as speed and volume of more than 10 work zones in the rural area of Mississippi were collected to verify the newly improved QuickZone in undersaturated conditions; CORSIM, traffic simulation software sponsored by FHWA, was utilized to compare the delay from the improved QuickZone for the work zones in oversaturated conditions. Verification results from the numerical examples showed that the improved QuickZone provided more reasonable delay estimations than the original version did, especially for rural work zones in undersaturated conditions. Therefore, the improved QuickZone can capture the delays in undersaturated and oversaturated conditions.

Traffic flow and occupancy data from loop detectors are used for calibrating these models and specifying the inputs to the simulation. Flow data from ramps, however, are often found to be missing or incorrect This paper elaborates an imputation procedure used to determine these ramp flows. This automated imputation procedure is based on an adaptive identification technique that attempts to minimize the error between the simulated and the measured densities. Simulation results using the imputed flow data indicate good conformation with loop detector measurements.

J	Inman, VW				Inman, Vaughan W.			Evaluation of Signs and Markings for Partial Continuous Flow Intersection	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The continuous flow intersection (CFI) supports high traffic flow where there is a large volume of left turns. The CFI accomplishes this by moving left-turning traffic to the left side of a highway before the main intersection. Left turns can then be made at the same time as the opposing through movement. This eliminates the need for separate left turn signal phasing and reduces the potential conflict points between left-turning and through traffic. Because CFI left turn movements begin well in advance of the road junction, signing and marking requirements are different from those for conventional intersections. This study reports the results of a driving simulator study that compared alternative signing and marking options. Three strategies for navigation signing in advance of the crossover were evaluated: overhead signing and two different ground-mounted sign alternatives. In addition, on a leg of the CFI that did not cross left-turning traffic to the left side of the roadway, alternative schemes for emphasizing the location of the stop line were evaluated. The results showed that the ground-mounted navigation signing treatment that included a "Keep Left" advance sign was as effective as an overhead navigation sign. All treatments for designating the stop line were equally effective.

Evacuation Planning Using the Integrated System of Activity-Based Modeling and Dynamic Traffic Assignment	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL	The occurrence of natural disasters in the coastal regions and numerous potential events in urban regions have drawn considerable attention among transportation stakeholders. Federal, state, and local officials need to be effectively prepared to address the challenges raised by an evacuation. The focus of this research effort is to develop a tool to study the repercussions of evacuation of an entire regional transportation network recognizing the human behavior element. Neglecting these seemingly chaotic traffic flow patterns would lead to inaccurate system assessment and predictions. The influences of evacuees' locations in the urban region at the moment of emergency alert are studied. In addition, the locations of all members of the household are identified, and household member interactions are explicitly considered. Further, the accurate times the individuals enter the network to evacuate the study region are studied; times can vary according to where the other household members are located at that time and the travel time on the network to reach those locations. To accomplish the goals, the integration framework of activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment is used to study the evacuation traffic How patterns at the time of evacuation. Specifically, the paper describes the evacuation problem, discusses the utility of deploying the integrated module of activity-based modeling and dynamic traffic assignment for evacuation planning, and outlines the challenges in integrating these two tools.

J	Toledo, T; Katz, R				Toledo, Tomer; Katz, Romina			State Dependence in Lane-Changing Models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Lane changes have a substantial impact on traffic flow characteristics. The lane-changing model is therefore an important element in microscopic traffic simulations. Lane changing is commonly modeled in two steps: lane choice, which captures the desire to change lanes, and the decision about whether a desired lane change can be completed, which is captured by gap acceptance models. Most current models assume that these decisions are repeated at every time step of the simulation independently of previous decisions. However, it may be more realistic to assume that drivers persist in their lane choices, and so their desired lane at any time point depends on earlier choices. To capture persistency in lane-changing behavior, a model that integrates a hidden Markov model (HMM) structure is presented. The evolution of lane choices, which are the underlying hidden states, is modeled using a Markovian process. The observed lane-changing actions depend on these hidden lane choices. An important difficulty that arises with this model structure is the problem of unobserved initial conditions on the hidden states. A method to address this problem is proposed. Estimation results of the resulting model are presented and compared with a model that does not incorporate state dependence.

These types of events can have a significant impact on traffic operations, particularly in small urban and rural environments, where limited infrastructure is available to access and egress the PSE venue. The research presented here applied a variety of traffic management strategies to manage congestion resulting from football games at Montana State University in Bozeman, Montana, in fall 2007. These strategies included the provision of real-time travel information, road closures, traffic signal retiming, and real-time traffic monitoring. Results indicated that these strategies could be successfully applied in a rural community to manage the congestion arising from PSEs. For example, results indicated that signal retiming and manual traffic control strategies allowed for improvements in traffic flow on approaches that served game traffic.

J	Ngoduy, D				Ngoduy, D.			Macroscopic Effects of Multianticipative Driving Behavior on Traffic Flow Characteristics	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							MODEL; DERIVATION	Intelligent transportation systems have been considered an important solution in enhancing freeway capacity, and suppressing traffic congestion. One recent automotive technology has enabled a vehicle to communicate with several vehicles ahead via a wireless system. Such a communication system constitutes so-called multianticipative driving behavior. In general, the effect of multianticipative interactions on traffic flow dynamics has been studied widely in the literature on the basis of a microscopic modeling approach. This paper presents an alternative approach to gain insights into the effect of multianticipative driving behavior on traffic flow characteristics from a macroscopic model. The model is obtained from a gas-kinetic theory in which the multianticipative interactions are taken into consideration. It is found that the analytical and numerical results of the model are consistent with those obtained from microscopic models. It is argued that the results provide a better understanding of the effect of multianticipative interactions on traffic flow characteristics.

J	Geedipally, SR; Lord, D; Park, BJ				Geedipally, Srinivas Reddy; Lord, Dominique; Park, Byung-Jung			Analyzing Different Parameterizations of the Varying Dispersion Parameter as a Function of Segment Length	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							POISSON-GAMMA MODELS; MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES	Until a few years ago, the dispersion parameter of Poisson-gamma models had been assumed to be invariant of the characteristics of the observations under study, but recent research in highway safety has shown that the dispersion parameter can depend on the covariates of the model. To account for this dependence, some researchers have reported that the dispersion parameter should be modeled solely as a function of segment length. The primary objective of this research was to examine empirically whether the dispersion parameter should be characterized using only the length of the segment. If not, the secondary objective consisted of determining alternative parameterizations using other covariates that would offer a better approach for characterizing the variance function of Poisson-gamma models. To accomplish the study objectives, 10 parameterizations describing the varying dispersion parameter were estimated with three different data sets collected in Texas, California, and Washington State. Flow-only models were used for comparing the parameterizations. The Akaike information criterion and other related goodness-of-fit (GOF) measures were used for evaluating and comparing the different models. The results of this study show that no single functional form or parameterization is suitable for all the data sets. Traffic flow was more significantly associated with the structured variation observed in the data than segment length. It is therefore recommended that transportation safety analysts evaluate different parameterizations and select the most appropriate one using a combination of GOF criteria, including the significance of the model's coefficients.

Delay Pattern Estimation for Signalized Intersections Using Sampled Travel Times	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Intersection delays are the major contributing factor to arterial delays. Methods to estimate intersection delay patterns by using measured travel times are studied. The delay patterns provide a way to estimate the delay for any vehicle arriving at the intersection at any time, which is useful for providing time-dependent intersection delay information to the driving public. The model requires sampled travel times between two consecutive locations on arterial streets, one upstream and the other downstream of a signalized intersection, without the need to know signal timing or traffic flow information. Signal phases can actually be estimated from the delay patterns, which is a unique feature of the proposed method in this paper. The proposed model is based on two observations regarding delays for signalized intersections: (a) delay can be approximately represented by piecewise linear curves due to the characteristics of queue forming and discharging and (b) there is a nontrivial increase in delay after the start of the red time that enables detection of the start of a cycle. A least-squares-based algorithm is developed to match measured delays in each cycle by using piecewise linear curves.

J	Glennie, C				Glennie, Craig			Kinematic Terrestrial Light-Detection and Ranging System for Scanning	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Highway corridor surveys are becoming more difficult and expensive to carry out because of the need to minimize lane closures, traffic disruptions, and safety hazards posed to the surveyors and public. Roadway surveyors are at risk when working in the traffic corridor if they are unable to move with the How of traffic. Safety for the traveling public is also a concern when lanes are closed or blocked by slow-moving vehicles. Costs for the placement of safety features to protect a survey crew can in some instances be greater than the cost of the survey itself. To mitigate these problems, a survey data acquisition tool is needed that can collect topographic and infrastructure information without disrupting traffic How. Terrapoint has developed a novel kinematic laser scanning system that can be deployed on a passenger vehicle or small watercraft. Light-detection and ranging (LIDAR) digital imagery and video are collected from the survey platform while it is moving at traffic speeds. The system is georeferenced with a high-accuracy Global Positioning System-inertial measurement unit. Terrapoint's mobile LIDAR scanner has successfully surveyed existing highway corridors all over North America. It has also proven sufficiently accurate for scanning airport runway surfaces so as to predict areas where water will pool. Moving with the traffic flow and not requiring an escort, the system scans a 360 degrees swath that includes the pavement surface and objects to the sides and above the survey vehicle.

Traffic impacts can be estimated by using microscopic simulation models. One challenge in using these software models is obtaining the desired work zone capacity values, which tend to vary from state to state. Thus, the default parameter values in the model that are suitable for normal traffic conditions are unsuitable for work zone conditions, let alone for conditions specific to particular states. Although a few studies have been conducted on parameter selection to obtain desired capacity values, none of them have provided a convenient look-up table (or chart) for the parameter values that will replicate field-observed capacities. Without such provision it has not been possible for state agencies to use any of the research recommendations. This study provides the practitioner a simple method for choosing appropriate values of driving behavior parameters in the VISSIM microsimulation model to match the desired field capacity for work zones operating in a typical early-merge system. The two most significant car-following parameters and one lane-changing parameter were selected and varied to obtain different work zone capacity values. CC1 is the desired time headway, CC2 is the longitudinal following threshold during a following process, and the safety distance reduction factor is representative of lane-changing aggressiveness. It has been verified that the recommended parameter values not only produce the desired capacities but also create traffic conditions consistent with traffic flow theory.

To estimate the effect for larger penetration rates, simulations were needed. For a reliable impact assessment, the on- and off-switching of the system should be taken into account. Furthermore, because ACC systems are less cooperative than normal drivers, the reference behavior should include this cooperative behavior. In this research, cooperative driver models for normal drivers were developed as well as an ACC model that included on- and off-switching for the microscopic simulation environment known as the intelligent transportation systems modeler. Parameter settings were validated with data from the pilot. The results clearly show that on- and off-switching behavior has a large influence on traffic flow. This effect depends on the degree of congestion. In congestion, the effect of the ACC is larger. Without the possibility of switching it on and off, the ACC has a positive impact on throughput. However, when the ACC can be switched on and off, it has a negative impact on throughput.

Lost Time and Cycle Length for Actuated Traffic Signal	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								Time within an actuated signal cycle can be decomposed into time that is fully used, which is the saturation headway multiplied by the number of passing vehicles, and time that is wasted or lost. Activity network modeling is used to show the interaction between signal timing events and traffic flow transitions. Seven components of generalized lost time are identified: those associated with start-up, minimum green, parallel queue discharge (for simultaneous gap-out), extension green, parallel extension (for nonsimultaneous gap-out), the passing of the critical gap, and phase end. Simple formulas can be used to estimate all of these components for many practical cases, allowing one to estimate average cycle length without iteration. The modeling framework accounts for the dual-ring structure with minimum green and maximum green constraints and on-off settings for recall and simultaneous gap-out. Experiments with microsimulation software verify the formulas developed. The formulas show the sensitivity of lost time, and therefore average cycle length, to parameters that a designer can control including detector setback, critical gap, gap-out settings, and number of lanes They also show sensitivity to total demand and to the ratio of noncritical to critical phase volumes.

J	Tracz, M; Gaca, S				Tracz, Marian; Gaca, Stanislaw			Influence of Various Restrictions on Speed-Flow Models	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								This paper presents traffic speed models developed on the basis of numerous measurements. In studies of the speed-flow relationships the following research issues were analyzed: impacts of the speed limit, traffic flow, traffic flow composition, and time of day on speed-now and impacts of qualitative road and roadside features (cross sections, road function, accessibility, intensity of development, roadside pedestrian traffic) on free-flow speed. The research included road sections with numerous constraints of traffic freedom. Such sections include sections of roads through built-up areas (small communities and towns). Regression analysis using generalized multiple regression was the basic tool in investigations. In addition, in analyzing data from speed measurements, the classic form of the logit function for a multiple-valued regression was applied. The analyses showed that even at general and posted speed limits the characteristic traffic flow-speed relations can he identified. The shape of these relations is characteristic of empirical results in which the spread of recorded values is typical for randomness and impacts or local factors. Average speed in traffic How depends not only on geometric alignment of a road cross section but also on local factors and speed limits. Speed in free-flow traffic is significantly influenced by qualitative road and roadside characteristics. Most important of these factors are type of cross section, intensity of roadside development, and accessibility of the road.

A local synchronization traffic control scheme is proposed to manage queues at those critical locations through coordination of neighboring intersection traffic signals and freeway on-ramp meters. fly reducing the amount of traffic feeding into and increasing the amount of traffic discharging from heavily queued sections, the scheme can prevent a queue from evolving into gridlock and thus improve overall system performance. With the help of a network kinematic wave traffic flow model, the local synchronization scheme is implemented and tested on a computer for two sample networks, one small synthetic corridor network and one large, real corridor network. The numerical results indicate that this control scheme can improve the overall operational efficiency in both corridors considerably, with as much as 50% travel time savings. This control scheme appears to perform best under incident conditions and, somewhat surprisingly, compares favorably with a more complex global optimal control scheme.	[Zhang, H.

Traffic flow characteristics are studied in relation to lane use, the relationship between occupancy and density, relationship of flow-speed-density, and the relationship between FCD speed and RTMS speed. It is demonstrated that lane use characteristics on the basic sections of ring road expressways are similar to those of freeways, in which the average vehicle lengths in the median, center, and shoulder lanes are found to be approximately 5.78 in, 6.03 in, and 6.33 m, respectively. Further, the four essential parameters used to characterize the Van Aerde flow-speed-density relationship are calibrated and compared for the second, third, and fourth ring road expressways. Results indicate that the fourth ring road, which has the highest free-How speed, speed-at-capacity, and capacity, has characteristics similar to those of typical freeways. Traffic flow characteristics observed on the second and third ring roads are roughly consistent with the Greenshields model. It is observed that the second ring road has the worst traffic conditions, followed by the third ring road, and that the basic sections of ring road expressways have better traffic conditions than the areas around the ramp junctions. Finally, a regression analysis is done to develop the relationship between FCD speed and RTMS speed. It is found that RTMS speed is slightly higher than FCD speed, with a difference of less than 6%.

J	Sahin, I				Sahin, Ismail			Some Observed Features of Freeway Traffic Oscillations	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article							KINEMATIC WAVES; CAR; DYNAMICS; MODEL	Some recent published works on freeway traffic have focused on congested traffic conditions in which oscillations form and propagate upstream through vehicle queues. Some features of oscillating waves were examined through empirical evidence. The data measured on multiple days along an approximately 3.5-km three-lane freeway in Istanbul, Turkey, present pronounced features of oscillations, such as their formation, propagation, and growth. It was identified that oscillations form immediately upstream of a bottleneck, they propagate at certain speeds against the direction of traffic flow, and their amplitude grows while propagating. In reports published earlier, it was stated that oscillating waves propagate backward at nearly constant speed with no dependence on flow. It has been observed in this study that propagation speeds cluster into two groups with averages of 21.29 and 15.52 km/h at the downstream and upstream study segments, respectively. It was shown that any difference in propagation speeds may be attributable to the features of the segment studied and, in turn, to the slope of the congested part of the associated fundamental diagram. A theory on reduction of oscillation amplitude at merge sites proposed in the literature was tested, and predictions of the theory were validated with some acceptable error.

However, they are usually not used for that purpose on urban roads. This work is an approach toward utilizing the fundamental diagram on urban roads. On the basis of a host of empirical and simulation work, the first steps toward a routine application of the fundamental diagram are sketched. In addition, two approaches are compared, the first uses a traditional fundamental diagram as measured by loop detectors, and the second uses a whole-link approach relating link-travel-speed with volume. The travel times in particular, contain important information that can be used for traffic management applications.

J	Ye, F; Zhang, YL				Ye, Fan; Zhang, Yunlong			Vehicle Type-Specific Headway Analysis Using Freeway Traffic Data	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD			English	Article								The distribution of time headway has long been a research topic because headway between vehicles is an important flow characteristic affecting safety, level of service, driver behavior, and capacity of a transportation system. However, almost all reported research on headway is focused on mixed vehicular flow without considering the difference in headway with respect to different vehicle types. In this paper, with the use of I-day freeway traffic data from Interstate 35 in Austin, Texas, four time headway types based on different combinations of leading vehicles and following vehicles-car-truck, truck-car, truck-truck, and car-car-are analyzed at different traffic flow levels. Statistical comparisons between each vehicle type-specific headway and mixed vehicle-type headway are made to verify their significant differences. The paper demonstrates the necessity of vehicle type-specific headway study. The results of the paper not only identify qualitative differences between the vehicle type-specific headways and distributions, but also can be used as a reference for practical applications, especially for improving microscopic traffic simulation models.

Even if not targeted directly, better management of transportation systems are crucial after terrorist attacks, which may reach a disaster level, especially, if it includes CBRN elements. Evacuations are massive operations that require transportation of a large number of people outside a disaster zone and generally take place simultaneously with emergency operations. Thus, the need and main aspects of an evacuation traffic management methodology that includes an integrated look at different traffic flows and network management strategies is discussed in this paper.

Current traffic monitoring systems do not provide timely and granular information which could sufficiently meet system analysis requirements. Simulation augmented with Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as an important methodology to model and analyze transport systems. This paper reports our ongoing work on developing an open source road traffic VR simulator based on microscopic and car-following models, designed using Java Monkey Engine. Subsequent to a brief literature review on traffic simulations, we give a description of the simulator design, its functionality, and the driver behaviour models used in the simulator. We then simulate few interesting traffic scenarios and analyse traffic flow, speed, occupancy and other results produced by the simulator. Finally, we conclude and outline the future work.

The analysis of 5 different scenarios shows that the travel time and delay of the 3 arterial roads, I.A, I.B, R.1, decrease respectively due to the 8 measures and their road loads reduce 6.2% on the average, which means their traffic pressures are relieved effectively, while the branch roads just increase 7.06%. Moreover, this paper comparatively evaluates on the operation of the regional road traffic flow with different guidance case.

The method utilized an intelligent traffic camera system orchestrated with a web survey system to collect the traffic conditions and travelers' opinions. A large number of human perceptions were used to train the artificial neural network (ANN) model that classify velocity and traffic flow into three congestion levels: light, heavy, and jam. The learning parameters were heuristically optimized to gain highest prediction accuracy. The outcomes were a practical method and the model achieving as high as 94.99% accuracy. The model was then compared to the Occupancy Ratio (OR) technique, currently in service in the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. The comparison indicated that our model could determine the traffic congestion levels 12.15% more accurately than the existing system. The analysis revealed that the derived model classified congestion levels based mainly on the vehicle velocity, suggesting that the model could be modified and broadly used with various types of traffic sensors. The methodology, though conceived for use in Bangkok, is a general Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) practice that can be applied to any part of the world.

Lighthill Witham anti Richards (LWR) have developed a traffic flow model based on the fluid dynamics continuity equation, which is known as the first order LWR traffic flow model The resulting first order partial differential equation (PDE) can be analytically solved for some special cases, given initial and boundary conditions, and numerically using for example the finite element method (FEM). This paper makes use of the Galerkin FEM to solve the LWR model with constant speed. The road is divided into it number of road segments (elements) using the Galerkin FEM. Each element consists of two nodes. Each mule hits one degree (if freedom (d o f), namely the traffic density. The FEM provides a solution for the degrees of freedom, i.e. traffic densities of each node. The resulting simultaneous equations arc solved at different tinge steps using the Euler backward tinge-integration algorithm. In Belgium and also in the Netherlands, there is a special technique that can be used in order to prevent traffic jams anti increasing safety in situations with high volume of cars on the roads, i.e. block driving. It is a technique where cars drive in groups by order of the police when the roads are crowded. In this paper block driving is used as a practical example of the LWR model with constant speed. Thereby, it is simulated using the Galerkin FEM and the results tire compared with the analytical solution. The FIRM gives good results providing that: the road segments and time steps are small enough. A road with length 5000 m, constant speed of 25 m/s, segment length of 100 m anti time steps of 1 s gives good results for the studied case. At points of traffic density rate discontinuities, depending on the road segment size and time step size, the Galerkin FEM is accurate anti requires reasonable computational effort. From the research work carried out in this paper, it is found that the Galerkin FEM is suitable for modelling traffic flow at macroscopic level. The element size and tinge step size tire important parameters in determining the convergence of the solution in case of discontinuities in traffic density rate. Although this paper considers the case of constant speed, the technique can be extended in the future to include the case of non-constant speed, i.e. speed as a function of traffic density.

Proper estimation of traffic flow is an essential component of advanced management of dynamic traffic networks. The genetic nerve-network is developed, combined the nerve network and the genetic algorithm together, to estimate the short-term traffic volume.

Multi-agent approaches are often based on coordinating agents whose actions and interactions are related to the emergence of the phenomenon to be simulated. In this article, we focus on road traffic simulation, specifically the design of a road traffic simulation tool able to deal realistically with road junctions. We propose a multi-agent behavioral model based on (i) the opportunistic individual behaviors that describe the norm violation and (ii) the anticipatory individual abilities of simulated drivers that allow critical situations to be detected. Our proposition has been validated for different traffic scenarios. Specifically, we simulated the traffic in a real intersection and then compared the simulated traffic flow with the real flow to highlight the relevance of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Sarvi, M; Kuwahara, M				Sarvi, Majid; Kuwahara, Masao			Using ITS to Improve the Capacity of Freeway Merging Sections by Transferring Freight Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Freeway capacity improvements; freeway merging sections; heavy commercial vehicle lane changing; intelligent transportation systems for freight movement; merging behavior; merging microsimulation		This paper investigates the effect of heavy commercial vehicles on traffic characteristics and operation of freeway merging sections. Freeways are designed to facilitate the flow of traffic, including passenger cars and trucks. The impact of these different vehicle types is not uniform, creating problems in freeway operations and safety, particularly in the vicinity of merging sections. There have been very few studies that are concerned with the traffic behavior and characteristics of heavy vehicles in these situations. Therefore, a three-year study was undertaken to investigate traffic behavior and operating characteristics during the merging process under congested traffic conditions. First extensive traffic data collection captured a wide range of traffic and geometric information using detectors, videotaping, and surveys at several interchanges. The macroscopic detector data were used to identify and quantify the impact of heavy commercial vehicles on the capacity of merging sections. Subsequently, the microscopic data were utilized to establish a model for the behavior of drivers at merging sections. Based on this behavioral model, a microsimulation program was developed to simulate the actual traffic conditions. This model was used to evaluate the capacity of a merging section for a given geometric design and traffic flow condition. In addition, this model was employed to develop a variety of intelligent transport system control strategies that are associated with heavy commercial vehicles with the goal of designing safer and less-congested freeway merging points. The implementation of the proposed control strategies showed significant improvement over the capacity of merging sections.

J	Alperovich, T; Sopasakis, A				Alperovich, Timur; Sopasakis, Alexandros			Stochastic Description of Traffic Flow	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						Multi-lane traffic flow; Anisotropic look-ahead rule; Markov Chain; Spin-flip/spin-exchange dynamics; Arrhenius potential; Kinetic Monte Carlo	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA; SIMULATION; DIFFUSION; SOLITON; JAMS	We propose a traffic model based on microscopic stochastic dynamics. We built a Markov chain equipped with an Arrhenius interaction law. The resulting stochastic process is comprised of both spin-flip and spin-exchange dynamics which models vehicles exiting, entering and interacting in a two-dimensional lattice environment corresponding to a multilane highway. The process is further equipped with a novel look-ahead type, anisotropic interaction potential which allows drivers/vehicles to ascertain local fluctuations and advance to new cells forward or sideways. The resulting vehicular traffic model is simulated via kinetic Monte Carlo and examined under both, typical and extreme traffic flow scenarios. The model is shown to correctly predict both qualitative as well as quantitative traffic observables for any highway geometry. Furthermore it also captures interesting multi-scale phenomena in traffic flows after a simulated accident which lead to oscillatory, dissipating, traffic waves with different periods per lane.

Traffic flow is determined by the joint consideration of the temporal evolution of volume and occupancy. The boundary conditions of the different regimes are identified via a fuzzy wavelet approach based on the volume-occupancy relationship. Moreover, a Bayesian network is developed in order to discover hidden associations between the observed shifts and the traffic flow conditions they occur. Results from the data-driven approach indicate the existence of four distinct traffic flow regimes; these regimes hold in arterials with different geometric and signalization characteristics. Finally, results are further discussed via an analytical model based on the kinematic wave theory; the comparative study of both approaches provides strong evidence that the presented statistical framework is in agreement with a simple and elegant analysis including traffic parameters that are observable and measurable.

Travis			Linear programming models for the user and system optimal dynamic Network Design Problem: Formulations, comparisons and extensions	NETWORKS & SPATIAL ECONOMICS			English	Article						dynamic traffic assignment; equilibrium; linear programming; network design; recourse; stochastic programming; transportation networks	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; OPTIMIZATION	In this paper we formulate a network design model in which the traffic flows satisfy dynamic user equilibrium conditions for a single destination. The model presented here incorporates the Cell Transmission Model (CTM); a traffic flow model capable of capturing shockwaves and link spillovers. Comparisons are made between the properties of the Dynamic User equilibrium Network Design Problem (DUE NDP) and an existing Dynamic System Optimal (DSO) NDP formulation. Both network design models have different objective functions with similar constraint sets which are linear and convex. Numerical demonstrations are made on multiple networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the model and demonstrate important differences between the DUE and DSO NDP approaches. In addition, the flexibility of the approach is demonstrated by extending the formulation to account for demand uncertainty. This is formulated as a stochastic programming problem and initial test results are demonstrated on test networks. It is observed that not accounting for demand uncertainty explicitly, provides sub-optimal solution to the DUE NDP problem.

J	Tang, TQ; Huang, HJ; Xu, G				Tang, T. Q.; Huang, H. J.; Xu, G.			A new macro model with consideration of the traffic interruption probability	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Traffic flow; Interruption probability; Car-following behavior; Macro model; Linear stability analysis; Simulation	CONTINUUM MODEL; DYNAMICS MODEL; FLOW; VELOCITY; FREEWAYS; CLUSTER; WAVES	In this paper, we present a new macro model which involves the effects that the probability of traffic interruption has on the car-following behavior through formulating the inner relationship between micro and macro variables. Linear stability analysis shows that consideration of the traffic interruption probability can improve the stability of traffic flow if and only if the drivers' reactive time required for adjusting their acceleration based on the traffic interruption probability p is not greater than that one based on the non-interruption probability 1 - p. Numerical results verify that the new model can be used to analyze the effects of traffic interruption probability and traffic interruption on shock, rarefaction wave, small perturbation and uniform flow. The model has been applied in reproducing some complex traffic phenomena resulted by some traffic interruptions (e.g., signal light, pedestrian and tolling station). (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The pursued general approach to the real-time adaptive estimation of complete traffic state in freeway stretches or networks is based on stochastic macroscopic traffic flow modeling and extended Kalman filtering. One major innovative feature of the traffic state estimator is the online joint estimation of important model parameters (free speed, critical density, and capacity) and traffic flow variables (flows, mean speeds, and densities), which leads to three significant advantages of the estimator: (1) avoidance of prior model calibration; (2) automatic adaptation to changing external conditions (e.g. weather and lighting conditions, traffic composition, control measures); (3) enabling of incident alarms. These three advantages are demonstrated via suitable real data testing. The achieved testing results are satisfactory and promising for subsequent applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Effects of high occupancy vehicle lanes on freeway congestion	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						HOV lanes; Traffic flow; Freeway congestion		Previous research on the effect of HOV (high occupancy vehicle) lanes on bottleneck flows is extended here to entire freeways using both theory and empirical evidence. The paper shows that if the flows of both high- and low-occupancy vehicles remain invariant before and after a freeway lane is converted to HOV use, then the freeway's overall traffic density upstream of its bottlenecks is reduced - albeit less than expected - if the HOV lane is underutilized. As a result, HOV lanes can extend queues over longer distances. These expansions can be problematic if the queues' expanded portions impede traffic on heavily traveled routes that do not pass through the bottleneck. To quantify this effect, the paper analyzes HOV lanes on long, multi-ramp freeways. Formulae are given for the changes in people-hours and vehicle-hours of travel induced by an HOV lane, both when there is uncongested freeway space upstream of the queue to accommodate its expansion, and when there is not. All the inputs to these formulae are either observable or easy to estimate. Hence, the recipes can help evaluate any freeway's existing, or planned, HOV lane installation. The HOV lanes at all the sites we have analyzed, which are quite typical, add less than 2% to vehicular delay and reduce people delay by more than 10%. These estimates assume no increase in car-pooling. More generally, the paper also suggests how to deploy HOV lanes on city-wide freeway systems and recommends steps to better plan city-wide systems of bus lanes. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liu, HC; Balke, KN; Lin, WH				Liu, Hongchao; Balke, Kevin N.; Lin, Wei-Hua			A reverse causal-effect modeling approach for signal control of an oversaturated intersection	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						Traffic signals; Optimization models	QUEUE LENGTH CONSTRAINTS; SYSTEMS	A novel approach is presented in which signalized intersections are treated as normal highway bottlenecks for improved computational efficiency. It is unique in two ways. First, it treats the signalized intersections as common freeway bottlenecks by a reversed cause and effect modeling approach. Both traffic arrivals and departures are modeled by smooth continuous functions of time as if there were no interruptions to traffic flows from signals. The use of smooth continuous functions for departure curves instead of commonly used step functions makes it easy to apply differential calculus in optimization and future extension to a system of intersections. Second, a dynamic linear programming (LP) model is then developed to maximize the total vehicular output from the intersection during the entire period of congestion subject to prevailing capacity and other operational constraints. The continuous optimal departure flow rate (the effect) is then converted to signal timing parameters (the cause) that can be readily implemented. Two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm and examine its performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We use the Roe method to compute the solution to the traffic flow modelling system. Then we compute the gradient of the functional by an adjoint method.

J	Murena, F; Garofalo, N; Favale, G				Murena, Fabio; Garofalo, Nazareno; Favale, Giuseppe			Monitoring CO concentration at leeward and windward sides in a deep street canyon	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Deep street canyon; Co; Leeward; Windward; Modeling	URBAN DISPERSION MODELS; POLLUTANT DISPERSION; AIR-POLLUTION; CARBON-MONOXIDE; TURBULENCE; AREA; FLOW; VARIABILITY; QUALITY; NAPLES	Carbon monoxide concentration was measured on the two sides of a deep street canyon (aspect ratio = 5.7 and width = 5.8 m). One-minute average CO concentrations were obtained during a three-day monitoring campaign using an NDIR CO spectrophotometer. Traffic flow measurements were carried out in the same period and CO emission rates in the canyon were evaluated using the COPERT procedure. Data on wind direction and intensity measured at a meteorological station few hundred meters from the monitored street canyon are reported and analyzed together with experimental data. Results show that in the street canyon the difference between the two sides of the canyon is negligible regardless of wind direction. Experimental results are confirmed by CFD simulations. This result is in contrast with those reported for street canyons with AR congruent to 1 where on the leeward and windward sides different pollutant concentrations are found when wind direction is mainly perpendicular to the street axis. Simulations carried out with a computer fluid dynamic software show that vehicle-induced turbulence plays a main role in reducing the difference of CO concentration in the two sides of the streets. Our results may be of interest for exposure studies and for developing dispersion models in deep street canyons. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to provide information on concentrations of these pollutants inside a unique bus tunnel, and to develop a viable methodology for determining emission factors for on-road vehicles. Measurements were made continuously over a period of five days that included a complete weekend. Traffic flow rate and air flow rate were also monitored. The mean particle number concentration at mid-tunnel was 4.1 X 10(4) cm(-3), which was over four times higher than the urban background concentration. The mean concentrations of NOx and CO at mid-tunnel were 464 ppb and 802 ppb, respectively. All these values were between 2 and 4 times higher than at the air entry portal. Median concentrations during selected time segments coinciding with the morning and evening rush hours, mid-day during weekdays and full day during the weekends were determined and the corresponding bus emission factors of each of the three parameters was calculated. Mean emission factors found for particle number, NOx and CO were 7.1 x 10(14) particles km(-1), 8.1 g km(-1) and 15.9 g km(-1), respectively. These values compared well with previous studies, showing that the methodology adopted was sound and viable (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We use a common model in vehicular traffic theory in which a fixed point on the highway sees cars passing it that are separated by times with an exponentially distributed duration. We obtain the distribution of the distances between the cars, which allows us to use techniques from queuing theory to study connectivity. We obtain the Laplace transform of the probability distribution of the connectivity distance, explicit expressions for the expected connectivity distance, and the probability distribution and expectation of the number of cars in a platoon. Then, we conduct extensive simulation studies to evaluate the obtained results. The analytical model that we present is able to describe the effects of various system parameters, including road traffic parameters (i.e., speed distribution and traffic flow) and the transmission range of vehicles, on the connectivity. To more precisely study the effect of speed on connectivity, we provide bounds obtained using stochastic ordering techniques. Our approach is based on the work of Miorandi and Altman, which transformed the problem of connectivity distance distribution into that of the distribution of the busy period of an equivalent infinite server queue. We use our analytical results, along with common road traffic statistical data, to understand connectivity in vehicular ad hoc networks.

J	Gong, QM; Li, YY; Peng, ZR				Gong, Qiuming; Li, Yaoyu; Peng, Zhong-Ren			Trip-Based Optimal Power Management of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Dynamic programming (DP); intelligent transportation systems (ITSs); plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs); power management	DYNAMIC OPTIMIZATION; DESIGN; STRATEGIES; AGENT	Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have demonstrated the capability to improve fuel economy and emissions. The plug-in REV (PHEV), utilizing more battery power, has become a more attractive upgrade of the HEV. The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEVs, i.e., the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the trip destination. Trip information has so far been considered as future information for vehicle operation and is thus not available a priori. This situation can be changed by the recent advancement in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) based on the use of on-board global positioning systems (GPSs), geographical information systems (GISs), and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, a new approach to optimal power management of PHEVs in the charge-depletion mode is proposed with driving cycle modeling based on the historic traffic information. A dynamic programming (DP) algorithm is applied to reinforce the charge-depletion control such that the SOC drops to a specific terminal value at the end of the driving cycle. The vehicle model was based on a hybrid electric sport utility vehicle (SUV). Only fuel consumption is considered for the current stage of the study. A simulation study was conducted for several standard driving cycles and two trip models using the proposed method, and the results showed significant improvement in fuel economy compared with a rule-based control and a depletion sustenance control for most cases. Furthermore, the results showed much better consistency in fuel economy compared with rule-based and depletion sustenance control.

The transportation capacity could be even doubled when DDES runs in a pure up-peak traffic pattern where two connected cages stop at every two floors in an elevator round trip. However, the specific features of DDES make the elevator system intractable when it runs in some other traffic patterns. Moreover, since almost all the traffic flows vary continuously during a day, an optimized controller of DDES is required to adapt to the varying traffic flow. In this paper, we have proposed a controller adaptive to traffic flows for DDES using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) based on Our past studies in this field, where the effectiveness of DDES controller using GNP has been verified in three typical traffic patterns. A new traffic flow judgment part was introduced into the GNP framework of DDES controller in this paper, and the different parts of GNP were expected to be functionally localized by the evolutionary process to make the appropriate cage assignment in different traffic flow patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional approach and two heuristic approaches in a varying traffic flow during the working time of a typical office building.

The design and analysis of the presented method just depends on the I/O data of the freeway traffic system without requiring any other priori of the control system. Furthermore, the control input learning law is extended to a higher-order form by incorporating more control information of previous sampling instants for improving the control performance. Both convergence analysis and simulation results illustrate the validity of the presented methods.

J	Davis, LC				Davis, L. C.			Driver choice compared to controlled diversion for a freeway double on-ramp in the framework of three-phase traffic theory	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; decision dynamics; congestion reduction; traffic diversion	INFORMATION; PATTERNS	Two diversion schemes that apportion demand between two on-ramps to reduce congestion and improve throughput on a freeway are analyzed. In the first scheme, drivers choose to merge or to divert to a downstream on-ramp based on information about average travel times for the two routes: (1) merge and travel on the freeway or (2) divert and travel on a surface street with merging downstream. The flow, rate of merging at the ramps, and the travel times oscillate strongly, but irregularly, due to delayed feedback. In the second scheme, diversion is controlled by the average mainline velocities just upstream of the on-ramps. Driver choice is not involved. If the average upstream velocity on the mainline drops below a predetermined value (20 m/s) vehicles are diverted to the downstream ramp. When the average mainline velocity downstream becomes too low, diversion is no longer permitted. The resultant oscillations in this scheme are nearly periodic. The period is dominated by the response time of the mainline to interruption of merging rather than delayed feedback, which contributes only a minor component linear in the distance separating the on-ramps. In general the second scheme produces more effective congestion reduction and greater throughput. Also the travel times for on-ramp drivers are less than that obtained by drivers who attempt to minimize their own travel times (first scheme). The simulations are done using the Kerner-Klenov stochastic three-phase theory of traffic [B.S. Kerner, S.L. Klenov, Phys. Rev. E 68 (2003) 036130]. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Multifractality of random walks in the theory of vehicular traffic	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							LONG-RANGE CORRELATIONS; TIME-SERIES; FLOW; FLUCTUATION; DYNAMICS; MODEL; PATCHINESS; DEVIATIONS; TRANSPORT; WAVES	We investigate the origin of the experimentally observed multifractal scaling of vehicular traffic flows by studying a hydrodynamic model of traffic. We first extend and apply the formalism of generalized Hurst exponents H(q) to the case of random walkers that not only diffuse but rather also undergo nonlinear convection due to interactions with other walkers. We recover analytically, as expected, that H(q) equals 1/2 for a single random walker starting at the origin whose probability density function satisfies Burger's equation. Despite this result for a single walker, we find that for a collection of nonlinearly convecting diffusive particles, transient effects can give rise to multiscaling at given time scales for many initial conditions. In the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards hydrodynamic model of traffic, this multiscaling effect becomes more prominent for smaller diffusion constants and larger speed limits. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the realistic scenario of traffic that flows from small roads to large highways and vice versa, where transient effects can be expected to play a significant role.

J	Golob, TF; Recker, W; Pavlis, Y				Golob, Thomas F.; Recker, Will; Pavlis, Yannis			Probabilistic models of freeway safety performance using traffic flow data as predictors	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Article						Freeway safety; Traffic flow; Loop detector data; Accidents; Statistical analysis; Multinomial logit; Factor analysis		In this paper we lay the groundwork for gauging the level of safety of any type of traffic flow on a freeway, based on data from single loop detectors; the procedure can be implemented wherever such data are monitored or simulated. Our analyses are based on loop detector data for each of the freeway lanes for a short period of time preceding teach of over 1700 accidents in our case study. This case study covers the six major freeways in Orange County, California, for a month period in 2001. Recognizing that loop detector data at a specific time and place cannot be converted to speed, because it is not possible to know effective vehicle length at such a detailed level (that is, the mix of long and short vehicles is unknown at a specific place for a short period of time), we avoid using any direct speed or density measures among the parameters. Rather, we employ explanatory parameters that include not only central tendencies (means and medians), but variations, and measures of systematic and synchronized traits that capture patterns in short period of loop detector data. Such patterns include breakdown from free flow to congested operations or recovery back to free flow, and differences in traffic conditions across lanes. In the analysis, we uncover an extensive set of statistical parameters that capture those aspects of traffic flow that are strongly related to accident potential. We demonstrate that the parameters can account for speed and density, even though these are not used directly. Moreover, the parameters account for important differences among the types of accidents that occur under different types of traffic flow. (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Do air pollution emissions and fuel consumption models for roadways include the effects of congestion in the roadway traffic flow?	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE			English	Article						congestion; average speed; emission model; driving patterns; road traffic; fuel consumption	IMPACTS	Road transport emission and fuel consumption models are currently used extensively to predict levels of air pollution along roadway links and networks. This paper examines how, and to what extent, models which are currently used to predict emissions and fuel consumption from road traffic include the effects of congestion. A classification framework is presented in which a key factor, driving pattern, connects emissions to congestion. Prediction of the effects of different driving patterns in emission models is generally restricted to certain aspects of modelling, i.e. hot-running emissions of regulated pollutants. As a consequence, the effects of congestion are only partially incorporated in the predictions. The majority of emission models explicitly incorporate congestion in the modelling process, but for one important family of emission models, namely average speed models, this could not be determined directly. Re-examination of the (light-duty) driving patterns on which three average speed models (COPERT, MOBILE, EMFAC) are based, shows that it is likely that congestion is represented in these patterns. Since (hot-running) emission factors are based on these patterns, this implies that the emission factors used in these emission models also reflect different levels of congestion. Congestion is thus indirectly incorporated in these models. It is recommended, that, in order to get more accurate (local) emission predictions and to achieve correct application in particular situations, it is important to improve current average speed models by including a congestion algorithm, or alternatively, at least provide information on the level of congestion in the driving patterns on which these models are based and recommendations on what applications the models are suitable for.

The results show that the model can perfectly reproduce the effects that ramps have on the formation, the propagation and the evolution of the traffic waves on the main road.

Eight main costs are identified, most of them financial or environmental, and techniques are proposed to measure and, where relevant, price the total cost of congestion compared to smooth traffic flows. The intention is for this method to provide results that can be used by public-sector decision-makers to draw Lip a more efficient overall transport system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Real-time merging traffic control with applications to toll plaza and work zone management	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						merging traffic control; ALINEA; toll plaza management; work zone management; bottleneck control		There is a number of highway transportation infrastructures where traffic flow arriving on a higher number of lanes must merge into a lower number of lanes within a limited space, e.g., merging highways, merging on-ramps, toll plazas, work zones. When the arriving traffic flow exceeds the downstream capacity, congestion is formed, and the outflow is reduced due to the congest ion-induced capacity drop. A general conceptual framework for real-time merging traffic control is developed in the paper, aiming at throughput maximization or, equivalently, delay minimization. To this end, an algorithm known from local ramp metering operations is employed (ALINEA). The proposed framework is applied to new and innovative traffic control applications for real-time toll plaza and work zone management. Microscopic simulation results demonstrate the potentially achievable benefits. Further significant applications of the developed concept are outlined. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such an approach possesses the advantage of suitably addressing data imprecision and uncertainty, and it enables the incorporation of,expert's knowledge on local traffic conditions within the model structure. The model employs univariate and multivariate data structures and uses a Genetic Algorithm for the offline and online tuning of the FRBS membership functions according to the prevailing traffic conditions. The results obtained from the online application of the proposed FRBS are found to overperform those of the offline application and conventional statistical techniques, when modeling both univariate and multivariate traffic data corresponding to a real signalized urban arterial corridor.

J	Ukkusuri, S; Du, L				Ukkusuri, Satish; Du, Lili			Geometric connectivity of vehicular ad hoc networks: Analytical characterization	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						VANET connectivity; the number of reachable neighbors; information propagation; vehicular ad hoc networks; intelligent transportation systems; connectivity; reachable neighbors	VEHICLE	Advances in wireless communications are facilitating the development of inter-vehicle communication systems that will benefit mobility and safety objectives. Recently, these systems, referred as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), are gaining significant prominence from both government agencies and private organizations. VANETs are characterized by high vehicle mobility, unexpected driver behavior and variable traffic environment which bring forth challenges to maintain good connectivity. This study considers VANETs as a nominal system with disturbance. Under the nominal system, the traffic space headway is assumed to follow an approved traffic flow distributions, such as exponential distribution. Disturbance is then used to capture a set of uncertain traffic flow events caused by driver behavior and changes in traffic flow. In addition, robustness factor is incorporated to present the impact of probabilistic disturbance events that disrupt the node connectivity. Under constant disturbance conditions, the lower bound of reachable neighbors for each vehicle to maintain a high connectivity is analytically derived. Furthermore, we obtain the relationship between the number of nodes in a VANET and the reachable neighbors under which the network is asymptotically connected. Finally, in variable disturbance situations, the interaction between robustness factor and macroscopic traffic parameters are investigated based on the simulation data. The validation results demonstrate that the proposed analytical characterization can approximate VANET connectivity very well.

The behavior of the new model is investigated analytically and numerically. The stability, neutral stability, and instability conditions of the uniform flow are obtained by the use of linear stability theory. The stability of the uniform flow is strengthened effectively by the introduction of the backward-looking effect. The numerical simulations are carried out to verify the validity of the new model. The outcomes of the simulation are corresponding to the linearly analytical results. The analytical and numerical results show that the performance of the new model is better than that of the previous models.

We present the car-following model of multi-lane traffic in which slow and fast vehicles flow with changing lanes. We investigate the traffic states of the vehicular mixture under the periodic boundary. Two values of the current appear at a density and two current curves are obtained. Vehicles move with changing lanes in the traffic state of high current, while vehicles move without changing lanes in the traffic state of low current. They depend on the density, the fraction of slow vehicles, and the initial condition. In the high-current curve, the jamming transition between the free flow and the jammed state occurs at a low density. The fundamental diagrams (current-density diagrams) are shown for the single-lane, two-lane, three-lane, and four-lane traffics. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Michael			Sampling for Global Epidemic Models and the Topology of an International Airport Network	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Mathematical models that describe the global spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) often consider a sample of international airports as a network supporting disease spread. However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities ( around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.	[Bobashev, Georgiy; Morris, Robert J.; Goedecke, D.

J	Lee, C; Abdel-Aty, M				Lee, Chris; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			Presence of passengers: Does it increase or reduce driver's crash potential?	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						passenger; driver; freeway crash; bivariate probit; binary logit	TEENAGE DRIVERS; OLDER DRIVERS; RISK; CAR; VEHICLE; INJURY; RESTRICTIONS; COLLISION; NIGHTTIME; ALCOHOL	This study examines the impact of passengers on the driver's crash potential on freeways. To estimate the impact, a set of bivariate probit models were developed using the 5-year (1999-2003) crash records on a 36.3-mile stretch of Interstate-4 freeway (1-4) in Orlando, Florida. Bivariate probit models identify the correlation between potentially inter-related choices of three passenger characteristics and three crash characteristics. The analysis using bivariate probit models showed that there exist strong correlations between passenger and crash characteristics. It was found that drivers generally display safer driving behavior when they are accompanied by passengers, and more passengers reduce driver's crash potential. It was also found that younger driver's crash potential increases with the presence of a younger passenger only. In addition, the analysis of crash type using traffic flow parameters at the time of crashes showed that young drivers with only younger passengers are more likely to be involved in single-vehicle crashes in high-speed and low-volume conditions. The findings in this study provide insight into how the presence of passengers has an impact on driver behavior and traffic safety in various conditions. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Li, YF; Bai, Y				Li, Yingfeng; Bai, Yong			Development of crash-severity-index models for the measurement of work zone risk levels	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						crash; highway; risk; safety; work zone		Highway work zones interrupt regular traffic flows and create safety problems. Improving safety without sacrificing the main function of highways is a challenging task that traffic engineers and researchers have to confront. In this study, the concept of using crash severity index (CSI) for work zone safety evaluation was proposed and a set of CSI models were developed through the modeling of work zone crash severity Outcomes. A CSI is a numerical value between zero and one that is estimated from given work zone variables. It is interpreted as the likelihood of having fatality/fatalities when a severe crash occurs in a given work zone. The CSI models were developed Using a three-step approach. First, a wide range of crash variables were examined in a comprehensive manner and the significant risk factors that had impact on crash severity were selected. Second, the CSI models were developed using logistic regression technique by incorporating the selected risk factors. Finally, the developed models were validated using the recent crash data and their ability in assessing work zone risk levels were analyzed. Results of this study showed that CSI models can provide straightforward measurements of work zone risk levels. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For this, we define three cost functionals that measure average velocity, average travelling time and total flux of cars. The global optimal control problem for a complex network is difficult to solve both from analytical and numerical points of view. Thus, we focus on a simple junction with one incoming road and two outgoing roads (junctions of 1 x 2 type), obtaining exact solutions to a simple optimization problem. Then, we use such results at each node of the network. The traffic evolution of some networks is then studied via simulations. In particular, it is shown that an appropriate choice of the traffic distributions can be useful in order to improve network conditions.

The highway monitoring module accurately classifies vehicles into eight different types and collects traffic flow statistics by leveraging tracking information. These statistics are continuously accumulated to maintain daily highway models that are used to categorize traffic flow in real time. The path modeling block is a more general analysis tool that learns the normal motions encountered in a scene in an unsupervised fashion. The spatiotemporal motion characteristics of these motion paths are encoded by a hidden Markov model. With the path definitions, abnormal trajectories are detected and future intent is predicted. These modules add real-time situational awareness to highway monitoring for high-level activity and behavior analysis.

J	Wang, C; Coifman, B				Wang, Chao; Coifman, Benjamin			The effect of lane-change maneuvers on a simplified car-following theory	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						car following; lane-change maneuvers; road transportation; traffic flow theory	TRAFFIC DYNAMICS; WAVES; MODEL; FLOW	This paper investigates the linearity of empirically observed spacing-speed relations for various drivers in the context of car-following theory and how lane-change maneuvers perturb the relation. It is shown that the impacts of lane-change maneuvers are not balanced, and the response time to an exiting vehicle is much longer than the response time to an entering vehicle. This accommodation imbalance will propagate upstream, and as discussed herein, it appears to be a source of speed and flow fluctuations (or oscillations) within a queue. This paper is motivated by Newell's simplified car-following theory, namely, that during congested periods, the trajectory of a given vehicle is essentially identical to the preceding vehicle's trajectory, except for a translation in space and time. One of the basic assumptions in Newell's presentation is that spacing and speed are linearly related. While other researchers have found macroscopic evidence supporting Newell's theory, they have also found that it fails in the presence of frequent lane-change maneuvers. This paper takes a microscopic approach, employing vehicle trajectory data. This paper provides support for Newell's assumed linear relation between spacing and speed over a large range of speeds when vehicles are not impacted by lane-change maneuvers. It also offers a possible explanation for the degraded performance of Newell's theory in the presence of heavy lane-change maneuvers. Although the focus is on Newell's simplified car-following theory, the empirical results of this paper have similar implications for many other car-following theories as well.

TGOVM is superior to the previous models in stabilizing the uniform traffic flow by considering all the front influencing factors: headways, relative velocities, and interactions. The linear analysis result showed its superiority to the GOVM, FLOVM, and FLRVM. The nonlinear analysis method is adopted to analyze this model, which described by a differential-difference equation. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is derived and the kink-antikink soliton solution is obtained near the critical point. The simulation results show that the stabilization is enhanced by the improvement.

A Study on the Performance of ARC Pavement for Traffic Noise Reduction - A SPB Comparison with Conventional Pavement	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						ARC pavement; traffic noise reduction; traffic flow		This research investigates traffic noise reduction on highways paved with ARC material and establishes a quantitative model for evaluating the effect of traffic flow on traffic noise. A series of traffic noise measurements have been combined with traffic flow monitoring to compare the sound performance of ARC with conventional pavements and analyze the relationship between the noise levels over ARC pavement with traffic flow conditions. The 24-hour averaged Statistical Pass-By (SPB) noise levels indicate that the ARC pavement demonstrates better sound performance than that of conventional pavement in traffic noise reduction. The energetic averaging method is employed to study the relationship between traffic noise levels and traffic flow conditions. The applicability of ARC pavement to traffic noise reduction under various traffic flow conditions is also investigated. A relationship between traffic flow and traffic noise is established in terms of SPB noise levels and the traffic volumes for different vehicle categories. The relationship is employed to compare the noise reduction performance between ARC and conventional pavements under various traffic flow conditions. The research results indicate that ARC pavement is very effective at reducing the noise generated by large vehicles.	[Dai, L. M.] N China Elect Power Univ, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Dai, L.

J	Li, YY				Li, Yanying			Short-term prediction of motorway travel time using ANPR and loop data	JOURNAL OF FORECASTING			English	Article						travel time; traffic flow; short-term forecasting; dynamic linear model (DLM)		Travel time is a good operational measure of the effectiveness of transportation systems. The ability to accurately predict motorway and arterial travel times is a critical component for many intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications. Advanced traffic data collection systems using inductive loop detectors and video cameras have been installed, particularly for motorway networks. An inductive loop can provide traffic flow at its location. Video cameras with image-processing software, e.g. Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) software, are able to provide travel time of a road section. This research developed a dynamic linear model (DLM) model to forecast short-term travel time using both loop and ANPR data. The DLM approach was tested on three motorway sections ill Southern England. Overall, the model produced good prediction results. albeit large prediction errors occurred at congested traffic conditions due to the dynamic nature of traffic. This result indicated advantages of use of the both data sources. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Simulation of mixed traffic flow on two-lane roads	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article							DISTANCE RED ZONES; SIGHT DISTANCE	Data were collected at several locations of two-lane roads in different parts of India and were analyzed to study the speed, placement, arrival, acceleration, and overtaking characteristics of different types of vehicles. A computer program is developed to simulate the traffic flow on a two-lane highway incorporating all these characteristics. The simulation program is coded in Visual Basic language and has also been animated. A number of simulation runs were performed to determine the capacity of a two-lane road and to study the effect of traffic mix on capacity and speed. The passenger car unit (PCU) for an individual category of vehicles is calculated and the effect of directional split on capacity is evaluated. Capacity of a two-lane road under an all cars situation is estimated as 2,860 PCU/h. It increases to 5,600 vehicle per hour (vph) in case of all two-wheelers and reduces to 580 vph in case of all tractors situation. The capacity also reduces as the directional split moves away from an even split of 50/50 and this reduction is linear. It is further observed that the capacity of a two-lane road decreases as the proportion of three-wheeler, tractor, or heavy vehicle increases in the traffic stream. But, in the case of two-wheelers the capacity was found to increase with their own proportion. This is attributed to the small size of two-wheelers and their maneuverability.

Modeling driver behavior and safety on freeway merging areas	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								Access to freeways is provided through interchanges to maintain the design concept of uninterrupted traffic flow. Therefore, provision of an appropriate entrance ramp and acceleration lane geometry that allows the entering vehicle to accelerate to a speed closer to the through lane speed is important for comfortable and safe merging maneuvers. In this paper, speed and traffic data were collected from 23 merging sites on Highway 417 located within the City of Ottawa, Canada, to study the traffic behavior at freeway merge areas. Analysis of traffic behavior showed that merging speed depends on both ramp and speed-change lane (SCL) geometrics. Lower merging speed was shown to be associated with higher collisions on the acceleration lanes. Right lane traffic volume and merging speed of entering vehicles were shown to significantly affect right lane speed along the acceleration lane. In addition, several statistically significant models were developed for the prediction of 85th percentile passenger car right lane speed, merging speed, merging distance, and acceleration on the SCL. A safety performance model was also developed to relate the total number of collisions on the acceleration SCL to the features of the merge area including the merging speed.

Long-range correlations of density fluctuations in the Kerner-Klenov-Wolf cellular automata three-phase traffic flow model	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							NOISE	Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) is a useful tool to measure the long-range power-law correlations in 1/f noise. In this paper, we investigate the power-law dynamics behavior of the density fluctuation time series generated by the famous Kerner-Klenov-Wolf cellular automata model in road traffic. Then the complexities of spatiotemporal, average speed, and the average density have been analyzed in detail. By introducing the DFA method, our main observation is that the free flow and wide moving jam phases correspond to the long-range anticorrelations. On the contrary, at the synchronized flow phase, the long-range correlated property is observed.	[Wu, J. J.; Sun, H. J.; Gao, Z.

The LORA-CBF routing algorithm is discussed and simulated in detail, considering a motorway environment with its associated high mobility. First, for small-scale networks, our proposed simulation model is validated with the results of a test bed. Then, for large-scale networks we use simulations to compare our model with both the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) algorithms. We use a microscopic traffic model, developed in OPNET, to ascertain the mobility of 250 vehicles on a motorway. Finally, we apply LORA-CBF in a vehicular test bed.

The stability condition of the model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. The modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is constructed and solved, and three types of traffic flow in the headway-sensitivity space, namely stable, metastable and unstable ones, are classified. Both the analytical and simulation results show that anxiety about lane changing does indeed have an influence on driving behavior and that a consideration of lane changing probability in the car-following model could stabilize traffic flows. The quantitative relationship between stability improvement and lane changing probability is also investigated.

The number of vehicles contained in a highway segment adjacent to the ramp merging region is used to control the on-ramp signal light. Simulation results show that the on-ramp control can improve the highway traffic, particularly when the ramp traffic is heavy. It is found that the location of detected highway segment, the length of ramp merging region and the control parameter governing the light,hange affect the highway and ramp traffic simultaneously. These three parameters should be coordinately designed for the improvement of both highway and ramp traffic. In general, the detected highway segment should be located at the upstream of the ramp merging region and cover it in the proper direction.

The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the flux of the whole road with the upgrade (or downgrade) increases linearly with density, saturates at a critical density, then maintains this saturated value in a certain density range and finally decreases with density. The value of saturated flux is equal to the maximum flux of the upgrade (or downgrade) without considering the slight influence of the driver's sensitivity. And the fundamental diagrams also depend on sensitivity, slope grade and slope length. The spatiotemporal pattern gives the segregation of different traffic phases caused by the rarefaction wave and the shock wave under a certain initial vehicle number. A comparison between the upgrade and the downgrade indicates that the value of saturated flux of the downgrade is larger than that of the upgrade under the same condition. This result is in accordance with the real traffic.

This model which consists of a Constrained Pressureless Gas Dynamics system assumes that the maximal density constraint is independent of the velocity. However, in practice, the distribution of vehicles on a highway depends on their velocity. In this paper, a more realistic model namely the Second Order Model with Constraints (in short SOMC) is proposed, derived from the Aw and Rascle model,(1) which takes into account this feature. Moreover, when the maximal density constraint is saturated, the SOMC model "relaxes" to the Lighthill and Whitham model.(20) An existence result of weak solutions for this model by means of cluster dynamics is proved in order to construct a sequence of approximations, and the associated Riemann problem is solved completely.

J	Sheu, JB				Sheu, Jiuh-Biing			A quantum mechanics-based approach to model incident-induced dynamic driver behavior	PHYSICA D-NONLINEAR PHENOMENA			English	Article						quantum mechanics; optic flow; traffic behavior model	REAL-TIME PREDICTION; TRAFFIC FLOW; BOTTLENECKS; CONGESTION	A better understanding of the psychological factors influencing drivers, and the resulting driving behavior responding to incident-induced lane traffic phenomena while passing by an incident site is vital to the improvement of road safety. This paper presents a microscopic driver behavior model to explain the dynamics of the instantaneous driver decision process under lane-blocking incidents on adjacent lanes. The proposed conceptual framework decomposes the corresponding driver decision process into three sequential phases: (1) initial stimulus, (2) glancing-around car-following, and (3) incident-induced driving behavior. The theorem of quantum mechanics in optical flows is applied in the first phase to explain the motion-related perceptual phenomena while vehicles approach the incident site in adjacent lanes, followed by the incorporation of the effect of quantum optical flows in modeling the induced glancing-around car-following behavior in the second phase. Then, an incident-induced driving behavior model is formulated to reproduce the dynamics of driver behavior conducted in the process of passing by an incident site in the adjacent lanes. Numerical results of model tests using video-based incident data indicate the validity of the proposed traffic behavior model in analyzing the incident-induced lane traffic phenomena. It is also expected that such a proposed quantum-mechanics based methodology can throw more light if applied to driver psychology and response in anomalous traffic environments in order to improve road safety.

A stochastic wave propagation model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	7th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems	2004	Washington, DC	IEEE		gap time; stochastic wave propagation; car-following	KINEMATIC WAVES; TRAFFIC FLOW	We introduce in this paper gap time, the time taken for a following vehicle to travel at its current speed the distance between its head position and the position of the rear of its leading vehicle, as a fundamental parameter for modeling some prominent features of congested traffic, namely the scatter of the fundamental diagram and the growth and decay of traffic disturbances on highways. In the model, traffic waves propagate in a stochastic manner and their speeds are determined by the relative differences between gap times and the reaction times of drivers. The scatter on the fundamental diagram and the growth and decay of perturbations are explained by random fluctuations of gap time and random transitions of traffic states on the fundamental diagram, respectively. Empirical data are used to validate the model and the evaluation shows close correspondence between model predictions and field observations. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhang, H.

J	Lu, CC; Mahmassani, HS; Zhou, XS				Lu, Chung-Cheng; Mahmassani, Hani S.; Zhou, Xuesong			A bi-criterion dynamic user equilibrium traffic assignment model and solution algorithm for evaluating dynamic road pricing strategies	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article						dynamic traffic assignment; bi-criterion dynamic user equilibrium; dynamic road pricing; value of time; heterogeneous driver preferences; network models	TRAVEL-TIME SAVINGS; NETWORK; RELIABILITY; CHOICE	To support the evaluation of dynamic road pricing strategies in a network context, this study develops a bi-criterion dynamic user equilibrium (BDUE) model, which aims to capture users' path choices in response to time-varying toll charges, and hence explicitly considers heterogeneous users with different value of time (VOT) preferences in the underlying path choice decision framework. The VOT is represented as a continuously distributed random variable across the population of trips, and an infinite dimensional variational inequality formulation is established to characterize the solutions to the BDUE problem. This study proposes a simulation-based heuristic approach to find the BDUE path flow patterns. Specifically, embedded in the algorithmic framework are (i) a bi-criterion time-dependent least generalized cost path algorithm applied to generate the extreme efficient path set and the corresponding set of breakpoints that naturally defines the multiple user classes, thereby generating the descent direction from a multi-class auxiliary path flow vector, and (ii) a traffic simulator used to describe the traffic flow propagation and determine experienced travel times and costs. To circumvent the difficulty of storing the memory-intensive path set and routing policies for large-scale network applications, a vehicle-based implementation technique is proposed to use the vehicle path set as a proxy for keeping track of the path assignment results. A set of numerical experiments are conducted on several real road networks to explore the convergence behavior and solution quality of the BDUE algorithm, as well as to investigate how VOT distributions affect the path flow pattern and toll road usage under dynamic road pricing scenarios.

J	Zhao, XM; Gao, ZY; Li, KP				Zhao, Xiao-mei; Gao, Zi-you; Li, Ke-ping			The capacity of two neighbour intersections considering the influence of the bus stop	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; neighbour intersections; bus stop; capacity	CELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODEL; TRAFFIC FLOW; SYSTEMS	In this paper, we use a two-lane CA model to investigate the effect of a bus stop between two neighbouring intersections on the capacity of the bus. Both the case of a bus stop with a special stopping lane and that of one without are considered. The capacity versus the distance L-B(L-D) between the stop and the upstream (downstream) intersection is studied, with respect to the entering probability P-e and the traffic light cycle T. It is found that a bus stop near an intersection can act as a bottleneck and cause a drop in the capacity when the L-B (or L-D) is below a critical point L-Bc1 (or L-Dc1). However, the situation when the stop is located near the downstream intersection is worse than that of the upstream one. Furthermore, the simulation results show that the negative effect varies with the increase of the cycle time T and the capacity can be maximized by adjusting T. Comparisons between the two cases suggest that the stopping lane can improve the capacity to some extent. These results mean T and the capacity can be exploited by changing the position of the bus stop or the cycle time, and adding a stopping lane if necessary. These findings may be useful in offering scientific guidance for the management and design of traffic networks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Lord, D; Park, PYJ				Lord, Dominique; Park, Peter Young-Jin			Investigating the effects of the fixed and varying dispersion parameters of Poisson-gamma models on empirical Bayes estimates	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						crash prediction models; dispersion parameter; empirical Bayes estimates; negative binomial; rural intersections	MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES; ROAD SECTIONS; ACCIDENTS; SITES; FLOW	Traditionally, transportation safety analysts have used the empirical Bayes (EB) method to improve the estimate of the long-term mean of individual sites; to correct for the regression-to-the-mean (RTM) bias in before-after studies; and to identify hotspots or high risk locations. The EB method combines two different sources of information: (1) the expected number of crashes estimated via crash prediction models, and (2) the observed number of crashes at individual sites. Crash prediction models have traditionally been estimated using a negative binomial (NB) (or Poisson-gamma) modeling framework due to the over-dispersion commonly found in crash data. A weight factor is used to assign the relative influence of each source of information on the EB estimate. This factor is estimated using the mean and variance functions of the NB model. With recent trends that illustrated the dispersion parameter to be dependent upon the covariates of NB models, especially for traffic flow-only models, as well as varying as a function of different time-periods, there is a need to determine how these models may affect EB estimates. The objectives of this study are to examine how commonly used functional forms as well as fixed and time-varying dispersion parameters affect the EB estimates. To accomplish the study objectives, several traffic flow-only crash prediction models were estimated using a sample of rural three-legged intersections located in California. Two types of aggregated and time-specific models were produced: (1) the traditional NB model with a fixed dispersion parameter and (2) the generalized NB model (GNB) with a time-varying dispersion parameter, which is also dependent upon the covariates of the model. Several statistical methods were used to compare the fitting performance of the various functional forms. The results of the study show that the selection of the functional form of NB models has an important effect on EB estimates both in terms of estimated values, weight factors, and dispersion parameters. Time-specific models with a varying dispersion parameter provide better statistical performance in terms of goodness-of-fit (GOF) than aggregated multi-year models. Furthermore, the identification of hazardous sites, using the EB method, can be significantly affected when a GNB model with a time-varying dispersion parameter is used. Thus, erroneously selecting a functional form may lead to select the wrong sites for treatment. The study concludes that transportation safety analysts should not automatically use an existing functional form for modeling motor vehicle crashes without conducting rigorous analyses to estimate the most appropriate functional form linking crashes with traffic flow.

J	Shukla, AK; Jain, SS; Parida, M; Srivastava, JB				Shukla, Arvind Kumar; Jain, Sukhvir Singh; Parida, Manoranjan; Srivastava, Jyoti Bhushan			PERFORMANCE OF TRAFFIC NOISE MODELS FOR METROPOLITAN CITIES	ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL			English	Article						CORTN; FHWA; model; noise; traffic		In India, transportation sector is growing fast and the number of vehicles on Indian roads is increasing at a rate more than 7 percent a year. During the period of 50 years from 1951 to 2001, the number of vehicles has increased from 0.3 million to 43 million i.e. an increase of almost 143 times. This has led to overcrowded roads and noise pollution. The transportation sector is one of the major contributors to noise in urban areas, accounting to as much as 55 percent of total noise on the arterials. Interrupted traffic flow noise is associated with the typical congested conditions in the urban area and has different characteristics from the traffic noise generated by free flow traffic on rural roads. These differences arise from the various traffic flow characteristics such as heterogeneity of traffic, flow speeds etc., which is in contrast to traffic on rural roads, where the flow is generally continuous. In this paper, analytical modelling has been used for predicting road traffic noise. Two models namely FHWA (Federal Highway Administration), and CORTN (Calculation of Road Traffic Noise) were applied. The data collected at ten different locations selected on the basis of land usages in urban areas of Lucknow, a historical city in India has been analyzed and utilized for modeling purpose. It was observed that predicted noise levels using a modified FHWA model are more close to observed noise levels than the noise levels predicted by CORTN Model.

J	Li, XL				Li, Xingli			Jamming transition in extended cooperative driving lattice hydrodynamic models including backward-looking effect on traffic flow	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MODERN PHYSICS C			English	Article						traffic flow; looking backward; phase transition; mKdV equation; anisotropy	EQUATION; SYSTEMS; PHYSICS	Two extended cooperative driving lattice hydrodynamic models are proposed by incorporating the intelligent transportation system and the backward-looking effect in traffic flow under certain conditions. They are the lattice versions of the hydrodynamic model of traffic: one (model A) is described by the differential-difference equation where time is a continuous variable and space is a discrete variable, and the other (model B) is the difference-difference equation in which both time and space variables are discrete. In light of the real traffic situations, the appropriate forward and backward optimal velocity functions are selected, respectively. Then the stability conditions for the two models are investigated with the linear stability theory and it is found that the new consideration leads to the improvement of the stability of traffic flow. The modified Korteweg-de Vries equations (the mKdV equation, for short) near the critical point are derived by using the nonlinear perturbation method to show that the traffic jam could be described by the kink-antikink soliton solutions for the mKdV equations. Moreover, the anisotropy of traffic flow is further discussed through examining the negative propagation velocity as the effect of following vehicle is involved.

Variable structure decentralized control and estimation for highway traffic systems	JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME			English	Article								This work is concerned with the decentralized control of traffic flow in highways using on-ramp metering and variable structure techniques. Both the estimation and the robust control problem are studied. Sliding mode observers are first proposed to estimate the state of neighboring highway segments in a two-highway-link model. Two independent variable structure controllers use the resulting estimates to locally stabilize the traffic flow around a desired set point, even if accurate estimation is not always possible.

Both annual average daily traffic (AADT) and global positioning system (GPS) data were used to correlate with a series of ranking metrics including five centrality-based metrics and two PageRank metrics. It was found that there exists a tipping point from segment-based to road-based network topology in terms of correlation between ranking metrics and their traffic. To our great surprise, (1) this correlation is significantly improved if a selfish rather than utopian strategy is adopted in forming the self-organized natural roads, and (2) point-based metrics assigned by summation into individual roads tend to have a much better correlation with traffic flow than line-based metrics. These counter-intuitive surprising findings constitute emergent properties of self-organized natural roads, which are intelligent enough for predicting traffic flow, thus shedding substantial light on the understanding of road networks and their traffic from the perspective of complex networks.

J	Smith, MC; Sadek, AW; Huang, S				Smith, Mark C.; Sadek, Adel W.; Huang, Shan			Large-scale microscopic simulation: Toward an increased resolution of transportation models	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								Recent years have witnessed an interest in increasing the resolution of transportation models to allow them to better address emerging transportation issues, such as concerns about emissions, air quality, and emergency preparedness. Microscopic simulation models, especially those that combine routing logic with accurate modeling of traffic flow dynamics, have vast untapped potential for modeling large-scale transportation networks and for achieving the resolution level required for addressing such emerging issues. Building and calibrating such models, however, is quite challenging and is currently not widely understood. This paper describes the process of developing and calibrating a large-scale microscopic model of Chittenden County, Vt., an area of about 1,400 km(2) (540 mi(2)). The model was developed primarily using readily available data to which most metropolitan planning organizations are expected to have access. Following a brief description of how the network was coded and the traffic demand specified, the paper discusses the process of error checking and model calibration. Preliminary calibration results are encouraging, given the complexity of the model. The paper includes a summary of the main lessons learned and modeling pitfalls that should be avoided.

Suppression of vehicle-induced bridge vibration using tuned mass damper	JOURNAL OF VIBRATION AND CONTROL			English	Article						tuned mass damper; vehicle-induced vibration; vibration control; highway bridges	RAILWAY BRIDGES	This paper focused on a numerical model for vehicle-induced bridge vibrations controlled with a tuned mass damper (TMD) system, taking road surface conditions into account. A computer program was developed to study the possible effectiveness of the TMD for suppressing the vibration of bridges under vehicle loads. Then, a comprehensive investigation was conducted on different bridges under two vehicle load patterns, i.e. two trucks moving side by side or several trucks passing over the bridge in a traffic flow. It was found that the additional damping provided by the TMD results in a reduction of the maximum dynamic displacement for both free and forced vibrations. On the other hand, for all the bridges investigated in this study, the reduction of acceleration is also significant. More generally speaking, it can be concluded that for the same TMD installed on the same bridge, it is more effective for cases with trucks passing over the bridge in traffic flow than for cases with only one truck. Such a study is helpful in evaluating the control performance before the real control devices are designed in practice.	[Shi, Xiaomin; Cai, C.

J	Bassan, S; Ceder, A				Bassan, Shy; Ceder, Avishai (Avi)			Analysis of maximum traffic flow and its breakdown on congested freeways	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						maximum traffic flow; gap time; traffic breakdown; traffic flow oscillations; periodogram	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; WAVES	This study analyzes the dynamic behavior of traffic flow over time by deriving the theoretical value of flow oscillations convergence ((F) over tilde) following the breakdown of traffic flow. Modeling traffic flow fluctuations over time reflects two basic zones: the increasing demand zone that terminates approximately when the maximum flow is attained, and the oscillations zone that reflects the fluctuations of flow until its stabilization. The models in the flow-time plane introduce a new concept of "stable maximum flow" particularly for design purposes. Both converged values and observed recovery flow values represent the end of the recovery phase transition where the traffic stream approaches the free flow regime through lower flow conditions than the maximum flow conditions. A comparison between breakdown starting times and times of the maximum flow shows that in most cases, when one breakdown period (OB) is experienced, breakdown starts 21-50 min after observing the maximum flow. Modeling changes in traffic flows in the flow-time plane is emphasized for OB or multiple breakdown period (MBP) cases. The analysis of frequent OB and infrequent MBP cases allow for better controlling of the traffic flow by maintaining its flow level below maximum. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Numerical simulation of soliton and kink density waves in traffic flow with periodic boundaries	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						traffic flow; car-following model; density wave; numerical simulation; periodic boundaries	MODEL; DYNAMICS; SYSTEM; JAMS	The soliton and kink-antikink density waves are simulated with periodic boundaries, by adding perturbation in the initial condition on single-lane road based on a car-following model. They are reproduced in the form of the space-time evolution of headway, both of which propagate backwards. It is found that the solitons appear only near the neutral stability line regardless of the boundary conditions, and they exhibit upward form when the initial headway is smaller than the safety distance, otherwise they exhibit downward form. Comparison is made between the numerical and analytical results about the amplitude of kink-antikink wave, and the underlying mechanism is analyzed. Besides, it is indicated that the maximal current of traffic flow increases with decreasing safety distance. The numerical simulation shows a good agreement with the analytical results.

J	Long, JC; Gao, ZY; Ren, HL; Lian, AP				Long JianCheng; Gao ZiYou; Ren HuaLing; Lian AiPing			Urban traffic congestion propagation and bottleneck identification	SCIENCE IN CHINA SERIES F-INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						cell transmission model; node model; congestion bottleneck; average journey velocity	CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; HIGHWAY; NETWORK; FLOW; OPTIMIZATION; WAVES	Bottlenecks in urban traffic network are sticking points in restricting network collectivity traffic efficiency. To identify network bottlenecks effectively is a foundational work for improving network traffic condition and preventing traffic congestion. In this paper, a congestion propagation model of urban network traffic is proposed based on the cell transmission model (CTM). The proposed model includes a link model, which describes flow propagation on links, and a node model, which represents link-to-link flow propagation. A new method of estimating average journey velocity (AJV) of both link and network is developed to identify network congestion bottlenecks. A numerical example is studied in Sioux Falls urban traffic network. The proposed model is employed in simulating network traffic propagation and congestion bottleneck identification under different traffic demands. The simulation results show that continual increase of traffic demand is an immediate factor in network congestion bottleneck emergence and increase as well as reducing network collectivity capability. Whether a particular link will become a bottleneck is mainly determined by its position in network, its traffic flow (attributed to different OD pairs) component, and network traffic demand.

J	Laval, JA; Leclercq, L				Laval, Jorge A.; Leclercq, Ludovic			Microscopic modeling of the relaxation phenomenon using a macroscopic lane-changing model	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						lane-changing; microscopic traffic flow models; kinematic wave (LWR) model	KINEMATIC WAVES; MOVING BOTTLENECKS; SIMULATION	A crucial challenge faced by current microscopic traffic flow models is capturing the relaxation phenomena commonly observed near congested on-ramps: vehicles are willing to accept very short spacings as they enter the freeway, but "relax" to more comfortable values shortly thereafter. This paper introduces a framework to solve this problem using a macroscopic theory of vehicle lane-changing inside microscopic models. In this theory, lane changes take place according to a stochastic process that has been validated in the field, and whose mean value is a function of lane-specific macroscopic quantities. As a consequence, the lane-changing logic becomes very simple compared to existing microscopic lane-changing models, and requires only one extra parameter. The resulting microscopic model is validated with empirical data. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Multi-class kinematic wave theory of traffic flow	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL			English	Article						LWR; continuum traffic model	MODEL; DYNAMICS; FREEWAYS; 2-LANE	The kinematic wave theory of traffic flow was independently developed by Lighthill and Whitham [Lighthill, M.J., Whitham, G.B., 1955. On kinematic waves. II. A theory of traffic flow on long crowded roads. Procedings of Royal Society A 229, 281-345] and Richards [Richards, P.I., 1956. Shockwaves on the highway. Operations Research 4, 42-51]. The original LWR model was extended in different directions to incorporate more and realistic details. The distinction of classes in traffic flow has received considerable attention recently. This paper proposes a framework for the different existing multi-class extensions of the kinematic wave theory. It turns out that the difference between all models lies in the assumption on how several classes interact. A new model is proposed where classes interact on a non-cooperative way. Slow vehicles act as moving bottlenecks for the fast vehicles, while fast vehicles maximize their speed without influencing slower vehicles. This leads to anisotropic behaviour of the traffic stream. This means that vehicles only react on stimuli in front of them. The new multi-class model is presented and illustrated in the moving bottleneck example of Newell [Newell, G. F., 1998.

J	Zheng, JF; Gao, ZY				Zheng, Jian-Feng; Gao, Zi-You			A paradox for traffic dynamics in complex networks with ATIS	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article							CONGESTION; MODEL; INTERNET	In this work, we study the statistical properties of traffic (e. g., vehicles) dynamics in complex networks, by introducing advanced transportation information systems (ATIS). The ATIS can provide the information of traffic flow pattern throughout the network and have an obvious effect on path routing strategy for such vehicles equipped with ATIS. The ATIS can be described by the understanding of link cost functions. Different indices such as efficiency and system total cost are discussed in depth. It is found that, for random networks (scale-free networks), the efficiency is effectively improved (decreased) if ATIS is properly equipped; however the system total cost is largely increased (decreased). It indicates that there exists a paradox between the efficiency and system total cost in complex networks. Furthermore, we report the simulation results by considering different kinds of link cost functions, and the paradox is recovered. Finally, we extend our traffic model, and also find the existence of the paradox.

To support the development of a less empirical model, a study was conducted in a busy street at the DAPPLE site in Central London to understand the processes and to identify important parameters that influence emission from paved roads. Ordinary road gritting salt was applied to the road and the particulate matter entering the air at near-road surface level was monitored using optical particle counters. The grit acted as a tracer. The grit moved rapidly along the road in the direction of traffic flow. Build-up of material at the kerb indicated material being thrown across the road by the traffic. Coarser particles were resuspended faster than the finer ones. A clear decay profile was seen in the case of particles larger than 2 mu m; particles smaller than 2 pm did not show any decay pattern during the experiment duration. Grinding of material appears to control the reservoir of fine particles on the road surface. The amount of material resuspended by traffic is about 30% less than those removed along the road and a factor of 6 higher than the amount removed across the road. Resuspension accounts for 40% of the total material removed from a road segment and 70% of the material removed together along and across the road. On average a single vehicle pass removes 0.08% of material present on a road segment at that instant. The calculation scheme is obtained from a short-duration study and therefore further studies of long duration involving varying road geometry and different traffic and meteorological condition need to be carried out before applying parameter estimates presented in this paper.

Network breakdown "at the edge of chaos" in multi-agent traffic simulations	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							EQUILIBRIUM; CONGESTION; TRANSITION; MODEL	Traffic is highly influenced by network structure and human behaviour. Small changes in the human behaviour can lead to huge changes in the load of a traffic network. Current transportation models do not, and most of them cannot, research such random behaviour but always calculate a steady state. In our multi-agent transport simulation, we frequently observe seemingly random "network breakdowns", huge traffic jams that spread over a big part of the network, making a normal traffic flow impossible. This paper describes the investigations that were performed on the results of our large-scale multi-agent transport simulations in an attempt to contribute to the better understanding of the dynamic processes in such simulations and, hopefully, better understanding and modelling of the real-world.

Slope failures and their response to rainfall intensity: an example from Co. Antrim, Northern Ireland, July 2007	GEOGRAPHY			English	Article							PRECIPITATION	In 2007 Northern Ireland had the wettest June (154.5mm) on instrumental record, surpassing the previous record of 147mm for June 1931. On 16 July, 23mm hr(-1) was recorded over southern and eastern areas of the Antrim Plateau. This produced local flooding in several places in Northern Ireland. However, only minor, near-surface slope failures occurred, even on the steep slopes of the Antrim coast. Those that did occur were only a minor impediment to traffic flow on the Antrim coast road. At the Minnis North mud flow-slide area, no slope failure resulted from this storm, despite the site having a long-term record of substantial failures. Flowside failure requires the development of high pore water pressures, but such pressures are only achieved with wet antecedent conditions, and are rarely produced by single, intense storm events. This observation illustrates the difficulty of using weather patterns to predict mechanically complex slope failures.	[Betts, N. L.; Whalley, W.

Two types of traffic controllers are developed through the use of either a speed command approach that can be implemented in an intelligent transportation system (ITS) or ramp metering that is a typical way of preventing a freeway from overloading. By means of the feedback linearization technique, the discretized macroscopic traffic flow model is reformulated, in which the desired change of volume in each section is treated as a virtual input. By exploring the casual relations among density, speed, and flow change, the corresponding speed commands can be determined. The traffic flow control problem is formulated as an H. control design problem so that uncertainties that are associated with the macroscopic model can be taken into account. Simulations show that the devised controller can effectively stabilize the traffic How in the unstable phase. Design flexibilities associated with the method are also discussed.

A dynamical systems approach based on averaging to model the macroscopic flow of freeway traffic	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-HYBRID SYSTEMS			English	Article						Traffic flow model; Hybrid systems; Non continuum macroscopic traffic flow model; Traffic state forecasting	CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; KINEMATIC WAVES	The flow of traffic exhibits distinct characteristics under different conditions, reflecting the congestion during peak hours and relatively free motion during off-peak hours. This requires one to use different mathematical equations to describe the diverse traffic characteristics. Thus, the flow of traffic is best described by a hybrid system, namely different governing equations for the different regimes of response, and it is such a hybrid approach that is investigated in this paper. Existing models for the flow of traffic treat traffic as a continuum or employ techniques similar to those used in the kinetic theory of gases, neither of these approaches gainfully exploit the hybrid nature of the problem. Spurious two-way propagation of disturbances that are physically unacceptable are predicted by continuum models for the flow of traffic. The number of vehicles in a typical section of the highway does not justify its being modeled as a continuum. It is also important to recognize that the basic premises of kinetic theory are not appropriate for the flow of traffic (see [S. Darbha, K.R. Rajagopal, Limit of a collection of dynamical systems: an application to modeling the flow of traffic, Mathematical Models and Methods in Applied Sciences 12 (10) (2002) 1381-1399] for a rationale for the same). A model for the flow of traffic that does not treat traffic as a continuum or use notions from kinetic theory is developed here and corroborated with real-time data collected on US 183 in Austin, Texas. Predictions based on the hybrid system model seem to agree reasonably well with the data collected on US 183. (c) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd	[Tyagi, Vipin; Darbha, Swaroop; Rajagopal, K.

Short-term predictability of traffic flow regimes in signalised arterials	ROAD & TRANSPORT RESEARCH			English	Article							TIME-SERIES; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MODEL; PREDICTION; QUANTIFICATION; PERFORMANCE	Modern intelligent transportation systems require the integration of accurate short-term traffic predictions for the purpose of enhanced network management. The present paper proposes a novel conceptual approach to traffic flow prediction based on the joint consideration of time-lagged volume and occupancy data, and information on the statistical characteristics of the short-term traffic flow evolution. For the purpose of prediction, a genetically optimised modular neural network architecture is developed. Findings indicate that the regimes in critical flow near capacity (where traffic flow exhibits unstable nonlinear evolution) are more difficult to predict when compared to the free-flow and jammed conditions. Moreover, the predictability of the critical-flow regimes decreases sharply in multiple-steps-ahead prediction, whereas the predictability of the regimes where traffic flow exhibits a more stable temporal behaviour is less affected by the expansion of the predictive horizon. Finally, a comparative study shows that the proposed modular neural network represents more accurately the anticipated traffic flow regimes when compared to the modular neural networks trained without the statistical information on the traffic flow evolution.

They solve many traffic congestion problems, save numerous human lives and avoid frequent automobile accidents. Optimizing the operation of traffic light systems in roads is essential for any city's economy, safety and environment. Simulation technology is probably the best tool to analyze and optimize the operation and design of traffic light systems. The increasing use of automobiles in cities has lead city administrators and local governments to install traffic lights and detectors in large quantities in order to avoid accidents and optimize the movement of automobiles and humans. Although signalization can solve traffic conflicts at the intersections, it causes stoppage. The chief objective of optimal traffic control is to improve system mobility and throughput at reduced delays. Delays and stops are not only irritating and pricey to drivers and passengers, but they also add to air contamination and energy use. In this paper, we analyze and demonstrate how the timings of a traffic light system are calculated in order to determine the optimum and proper timings needed to optimize traffic flow.

Akhtar Ali; Kim, Hojung; Baek, Seungkirl; Chang, Hyunho; Ahn, Byung Ha			System architecture of a decision support system for freeway incident management in Republic of Korea	TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE			English	Article						architecture; incident; freeway; traffic management center; micro simulation; non-recurrent congestion; intelligent transport		Traffic Management Centers play a vital role in efficient functioning of freeway network in the post-incident scenario. As per present practice in Korea, the traffic managers use a heuristic approach for incident analysis based on their experience of similar scenarios. However, this approach induces uncertainty thereby reducing the overall effectiveness of the subsequent incident management and rescue operations. This paper proposes a decision support system to account for these shortcomings. We name our system as 'FIAS' - Freeway Incident Analysis System. The novel idea presented in this paper is the use of historical, real-time and spatial data simultaneously to forecast post-incident traffic flows on a microscopic simulation platform, Cellular Automata. FIAS incorporate two additional rules in the conventional model to depict more realistic incident flow characteristics. This paper focuses oil the system architecture of the model and tests its performance by comparing its predicted values with a real incident data. The evaluation results confirm the validity of FIAS as it can model the time dependent microstructure of traffic flows with significant accuracy. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Shah, S.

Different arcs of the network are to be modeled by possibly different models depending on the requisite qualitative detail required: an isothermal Euler system of equations; linearized model derived from the isothermal Euler system or a steady-state model of gas flow also referred to as an algebraic model. At the vertices (or joints) of the network coupling conditions are defined. An analysis of the well posedness of the hierarchial coupling conditions is presented. The analytical results are tested numerically on different network configurations including a real-world network based on the Canadian mainline gas network. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This present study aimed to replicate the previous research in a different country. Variations in the number of fatal road crashes occurring between 1996 and 2005 in 73 territorial local authorities across New Zealand were modelled against possible predictors. The predictors were traffic flow, population counts and characteristics, car use, socio-economic deprivation, climate, altitude and road characteristics including four measures of average road curvature. The best predictors of the number of fatal crashes on urban roads, rural state highways and other rural roads were traffic flow, speed limitation and socio-economic deprivation. Holding significant factors constant, there was no evidence that TLAs with the most curved roads had more crashes than elsewhere. Fatal crashes on urban roads.were significantly and negatively related to two measures of road curvature: the ratio of road length to straight distance and the cumulative angle turned per kilometre. Weaker negative associations on rural state highways could have occurred by chance. These results offer limited support to the suggestion that frequently occurring road bends might be protective.

J	Brijs, T; Karlis, D; Wets, G				Brijs, Tom; Karlis, Dimitris; Wets, Geert			Studying the effect of weather conditions on daily crash counts using a discrete time-series model	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						crashes; accident analysis; weather conditions; INAR	MOVING-AVERAGE PROCESSES; HOURLY TRAFFIC FLOW; ROAD ACCIDENTS; SAFETY; FREQUENCY; AGGREGATE	In previous research, significant effects of weather conditions on car crashes have been found. However, most studies use monthly or yearly data and only few studies are available analyzing the impact of weather conditions on daily car crash counts. Furthermore, the studies that are available on a daily level do not explicitly model the data in a time-series context, hereby ignoring the temporal serial correlation that may be present in the data. In this paper, we introduce an integer autoregressive model for modelling count data with time interdependencies. The model is applied to daily car crash data, metereological data and traffic exposure data from the Netherlands aiming at examining the risk impact of weather conditions on the observed counts. The results show that several assumptions related to the effect of weather conditions on crash counts are found to be significant in the data and that if serial temporal correlation is not accounted for in the model, this may produce biased results.

The model's stability is analysed and the resultant user equilibrium (UE) state is shown to be stable under certain conditions. Numerical results in a grid network indicate that the model can generate convergent flow patterns and finally terminates at the UE state.

On the basis of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NS) model, it further considers the effect of headway-distance between two successive cars on the randomization of the latter one. In numerical simulations, this model shows the following characteristics. (1) With a simple structure, this model succeeds in reproducing the hysteresis effect, which is absent in the NS model. (2) Compared with the slow-to-start models, this model exhibits a local fundamental diagram which is more consistent to empirical observations. (3) This model has much higher efficiency in dissolving congestions compared with the so-called NS model with velocity-dependent randomization (VDR model). (4) This model is more robust when facing traffic obstructions. It can resist much longer shock times and has much shorter relaxation times on the other hand. To summarize, compared with the existing models, this model is quite simple in structure, but has good characteristics.

The couplings between the average flux and the fluctuations on individual links are shown to follow certain scaling laws and yield a wide variety of scaling exponents between 1/2 and 1. To quantitatively explain this interesting phenomenon, a non-stationary Poisson arriving model is proposed. The scaling property is interpreted as the result of the time-variation of the arriving rate of flux over the network, which nicely explicates the effect of aggregation windows, and provides a concise model for the dependence of scaling exponent on the external/internal force ratio.

Delay times in a cellular traffic flow model for road sections with periodic outflow	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							OPEN BOUNDARIES; AUTOMATON	A simple cellular automaton to model traffic flow is used to analyze the impact of traffic lights on travel times. The model is investigated on a stretch of road with open boundaries, where the inflow is driven stochastically, but the outflow is controlled by a traffic light with periodically changing outflow rates. Especially in the transition regime from free flow to oversaturated flow, the detailed space-time structure can be used to derive analytical lower and upper boundaries for the travel time function. The analytical results have been verified by a simulation study. The function displays a strong non-trivial dependency on the length of the system, which is at odds with a well-known formula derived almost 50 years ago by Webster. Such a model is interesting both from a theoretical point of view and for applications.

J	Sun, DF; Bayen, AM				Sun, Dengfeng; Bayen, Alexandre M.			Multicommodity Eulerian-Lagrangian large-capacity cell transmission model for en route traffic	JOURNAL OF GUIDANCE CONTROL AND DYNAMICS			English	Article							ASSIGNMENT	A new paradigm for building an Eulerian-Lagrangian cell transmission model for air traffic flow is developed. It is based on an aggregation of track data and is applied to the full National Airspace System in the United States. The Eulerian-Lagrangian model is based on a multicommodity network flow model constructed from historical air traffic data. The flow model is reduced to a linear time invariant dynamical system, in which the state is a vector of aggregate aircraft counts. This model is called a large-capacity cell transmission model in reference to the cell transmission model in highway traffic, which inspired this work. The predictive capabilities of the model are successfully validated against recorded air traffic data by showing an accurate match between predicted sector counts (based on filed flight plans) and measured sector counts. The problem of controlling the sector aircraft count is posed as an integer program in which the dynamical system appears in the constraints. To improve the computational time for solving the problem, the integer program is relaxed to a linear program. The computational results show that a high portion of solutions of the linear program are integers, making this method appropriate for high-level traffic flow management.

J	Tollazzi, T; Lerher, T; Sraml, M				Tollazzi, Tomaz; Lerher, Tone; Sraml, Matjaz			The use of micro-simulation in determining the capacity of a roundabout with a multi-channel pedestrian flow	STROJNISKI VESTNIK-JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						roundabout; pedestrian flow; traffic flow modeling; simulation models		The main purpose of this paper is to analyse the influence of the multi-channel pedestrian flow on the capacity of the one-lane roundabout, using discrete simulation methods. The proposed model is based on the theory of the expected time void between the units of pedestrian traffic flow, which have the priority when crossing the arm of the roundabout. The proposed model represents an upgrade of the previous research in the field of modelling traffic flows in the one-lane roundabout. While the previous model of the pedestrian crossing is handled as the single-channel system in which the pedestrians arrive randomly from one side of the pedestrian crossing only, the proposed model deals with the multi-channel system in which the pedestrians arrive randomly from both sides of the pedestrian crossing. In this way the mathematical model can better illustrate the real conditions. The previous model considers only the disturbances of entry traffic flow of motorised vehicles caused by the pedestrian flow crossing the roundabout arm. The proposed model considers the disturbances caused by the circular traffic flow of motorised vehicles as well. A simulation analysis has been conducted on the roundabout at Koroska Street in Maribor in which the counting of the motorised traffic flow and the pedestrian flow has been performed in the morning peek hour. The results of the analysis have indicated a high reserve of the capacity for pedestrians who arrive from the left and right sides of the roundabout with regard to motorised vehicles in the analysed arm of the roundabout. The real reserve of the capacity would otherwise be smaller in case of enlargement of the motorised vehicle flow in the future. Nevertheless it would be high enough for an undisturbed traffic flow of motorised vehicles through the roundabout to be possible. The presented methodology represents a practicable and adaptable tool for planning the roundabout capacity in practice and for the sensitivity analysis of individual variables on the throughput capacity of the roundabout.

The proposed model is a generalization of the well-known piecewise linear flow-density relationship in the LWR model. As observed traffic flow data call be well fitted with such continuous piecewise quadratic functions, the explicitly constructed solutions provide a fast and accurate solution tool which may be used for predicting traffic or as a diagnosing tool to test the performance of numerical schemes. We implement these explicit entropy solutions for two representative traffic flow cases and also compare them with numerical solutions obtained by a high order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme.

J	Li, MZF				Li, Michael Z. F.			A generic characterization of equilibrium speed-flow curves	TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						vehicular traffic flow; speed-flow relations; speed-density relations; highway capacity	NONEQUILIBRIUM TRAFFIC FLOW; CAR-FOLLOWING THEORY; DENSITY RELATION; KINEMATIC WAVES; HIGHWAY; CONGESTION; COST; IMPLEMENTATION; SINGAPORE; NETWORKS	By introducing the concept of speed elasticity of flow and density, this paper provides a generic characterization for a class of well-behaved equilibrium speed-flow curves that are differentiable and backward bending and possess monotone speed-density curves. We start with a comprehensive review on classical models, including Greenberg, Greenshields, and Underwood. A major limitation of these models is that the specification is uniquely determined by three road-specific parameters: the free-flow speed, the capacity flow, and the corresponding speed at the capacity flow, which makes the empirical application difficult due to lack of flexibility. Through a careful review of Del Castillo and Benitez [Del Castillo, J. M., F. G. Benitez. 1995. On the functional form of the speed-density relationship-I: General theory, II: Empirical investigation. Transportation Res. Part B 29 373-406], we have provided a new characterization for the Newell-Frankin model and made a connection between the family of rational generating functions and the Greenshields-type models. Based on three primitive regularity conditions, we derive a generic characterization for well-behaved macroscopic equilibrium speed. flow curves that integrate all classical models. Using the generic characterization, we show that the equilibrium speed-flow curves derived from the car-following models can be classified as a two-parameter extension of the Greenshields-type model. We have also made an attempt in proposing a plausible recti. cation to the speed-flow models from the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 so that they possess the backward-bending property. A formal linkage between the generic characterization of speed-flow curves and the theory of congestion pricing is also established.

We develop explicit expressions to calculate the MOE-which is the total travel time that is incurred by travelers, within the space-time region that is encompassed by the shocks and/or characteristic lines. A numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method compared with the numerical solutions that are obtained by a fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory scheme.

Using this model, we investigate the evolutions of inflow, outflow and flow on each link caused by a small perturbation of the network inflow under different route choice rules.

Considering the existence of overlapping between routes, this paper applies the cellular automaton model to simulate and investigate the route choice behavior under two information service strategies, namely travel time feedback strategy and mean velocity feedback strategy. Our simulation results indicate that the mean velocity feedback strategy can reduce the route travel time more efficiently than the time feedback strategy, particularly in longer networks with very short or very long overlapping segments. Its advantage in improving the network utilization efficiency decreases with the route length and drops first and rises afterwards with the length of overlapping part.

Stabilization of traffic flow based on the multiple information of preceding cars	COMMUNICATIONS IN COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS			English	Article						traffic flow; car-following model; stability analysis; ITS information	NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; RELATIVE VELOCITY; MODEL; CONGESTION; STABILITY; EQUATION; SYSTEMS; KDV	To enhance the stability of traffic flow, a new car-following model is proposed by taking into account the support of intelligent transportation system (ITS) information, which includes both the headway and the velocity difference of multiple preceding cars. The new model is based on the Optimal Velocity (OV) model and its extended models. The stability condition of the model is obtained by using the linear stability theory. Through nonlinear analysis, the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation is constructed and solved, and the traffic flow is classified into three types, i.e. stable, metastable, and unstable. The jam phase can thus be described by the kink-antikink soliton solution for the mKdV equation. The numerical simulation results show that compared with previous models considering only one of the ITS information, the proposed model can suppress traffic jams more efficiently when both headway and velocity difference of arbitrary preceding cars are taken into account. The results of numerical simulation coincide with the theoretical ones.	[Xie, D. F.; Gao, Z.

The models have been developed for three 8-h groupings of 10 P.M. to 6 A.M. to 2 P.M. and 2-10 P.M. at two air quality control regions (AQCRs) in Delhi city, representing an urban intersection and an arterial road consisting heterogeneous traffic flows. The result indicates that time grouping of 2-10 PM is dominantly affected by inversion conditions and peak traffic flow. The ANNCOP model corresponding to this grouping predicts the 8-h average CO concentrations within the accuracy range of 68-71%. The CO persistence values derived from ANNCOP model are comparable with the persistence values as suggested by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), USA. This work demonstrates that ANN based model is capable of describing winter period CO persistence phenomena.	[Nagendra, S. M.

Two discrete dynamic models are proposed, which are derived from Del Castillo and Benitez's exponential curve model and maximum sensitivity curve model. Both models have two parameters, which are the ratio of free flow and sensitivity average speed and the ratio of the absolute value of kinematic wave speed at jam density and the free flow speed. Chaos is found in the two models when the two values increase separately. The Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimension were used to examine the characters of the chaos in the two models.

J	Lammer, S; Helbing, D				Laemmer, Stefan; Helbing, Dirk			Self-control of traffic lights and vehicle flows in urban road networks	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Review						flow control; traffic and crowd dynamics; traffic models; self-driven particles	LINEAR COMPLEMENTARITY-PROBLEM; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; QUEUING-NETWORKS; SCHEDULING POLICIES; STATISTICAL PHYSICS; SYSTEMS; OPTIMIZATION; TRANSITION; DYNAMICS; TIMES	Based on fluid-dynamic and many-particle (car-following) simulations of traffic flows in (urban) networks, we study the problem of coordinating incompatible traffic flows at intersections. Inspired by the observation of self-organized oscillations of pedestrian flows at bottlenecks, we propose a self-organization approach to tra. c light control. The problem can be treated as a multi-agent problem with interactions between vehicles and traffic lights. Specifically, our approach assumes a priority-based control of traffic lights by the vehicle flows themselves, taking into account short-sighted anticipation of vehicle flows and platoons. The considered local interactions lead to emergent coordination patterns such as 'green waves' and achieve an efficient, decentralized traffic light control. While the proposed self-control adapts flexibly to local flow conditions and often leads to non-cyclical switching patterns with changing service sequences of different traffic flows, an almost periodic service may evolve under certain conditions and suggests the existence of a spontaneous synchronization of tra. c lights despite the varying delays due to variable vehicle queues and travel times. The self-organized traffic light control is based on an optimization and a stabilization rule, each of which performs poorly at high utilizations of the road network, while their proper combination reaches a superior performance. The result is a considerable reduction not only in the average travel times, but also of their variation. Similar control approaches could be applied to the coordination of logistic and production processes.

Statistical mechanics of steady state traffic flow	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT			English	Article						stationary states; traffic models	PHYSICS	Statistical mechanics of a small system of cars on a single-lane road is developed. A discrete particle hopping model, not characterized by a kinetic equation, but by the conditional probabilities of car velocities depending on the distance and velocity of the car ahead, is used. Distribution of car velocities for various densities of a group of cars is derived as well as the probabilities of density fluctuations. For cars with high braking ability, free-flow and congested phases are found. Platoons of cars are formed for a system of cars with inefficient brakes. Indications for a first-order phase transition between free-flow and congested phase are presented.

The approach is based on robust optimization and assumes that future travel demands and facility conditions are uncertain but confined to an ellipsoidal uncertainty region and traffic flows on the underlying network are in user equilibrium. The problem is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints and solved via a cutting plane algorithm. Numerical results from the Sioux Falls network suggest that the approach can potentially address realistic networks. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The traffic signal is setup at the merging part between the main road and the on-ramp so that it can control the vehicles of both roads. We simulate the effect of traffic signal on vehicle flows of main road and on-ramp, and the traffic capacity and average velocity at the merging part are discussed. Through the analysis of the phase diagram, it can be found that the on-ramp system with two-lane main road can embody more complicated and realistic traffic flow characteristics than the on-ramp system with single-lane main road. Compared with the model introduced by Jiang Rui [Jiang R 2003 J. Phys. A 36 11713], the simulation results indicate that the state of traffic flow is improved obviously and the capacity of the on ramp system has increased.

OSPM calculates the contribution of traffic emissions inside a particular street. whereas IFDM computes the background contributions, including the concentration levels caused by the surrounding streets, industrial stacks and domestic heating within a domain with a 20-30 km radius. Both models have been integrated into a new computer program. The coupled system was validated for NO, and PM10 concentrations in the city of Antwerp and was applied for scenario calculations in a city quarter in Ghent, Belgium. For the scenario calculations, the traffic emissions were obtained dynamically from the traffic simulation model PARAMICS, in combination with emission measurements. For each time step and for each car, the emissions of 5 pollutants (PM, VOC, NOx, VOC and CO2) were calculated depending on the car's category, speed and acceleration. Results show that stringent European emission standards for new vehicles will lead to reductions up to 70% in 2010. Local mobility plans show only a very limited effect. The results (time series, percentiles, yearly averages) allow a quick evaluation of the urban air quality situation with respect to the EU directives on ambient air quality assessment and management.

The two-lane macroscopic model using the optimal velocity model which has been introduced in the microscopic model is constructed on the basis of the one-lane model. We adopt different optimal velocity function to each lane and new rules of changing lanes are introduced. Numerical simulations are performed in order to investigate the characteristic phenomena of two-lane traffic flow. In particular, we concentrate the discussion about the property of "Synchronized flow", one of the most characteristic phenomena of two-lane traffic flow. Furthermore, the fundamental diagrams from the simulations are compared with those observed in a highway.

A family of numerical schemes for kinematic flows with discontinuous flux	JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MATHEMATICS			English	Article						conservation law; discontinuous flux; kinematic flow; numerical scheme; traffic model	CLARIFIER-THICKENER UNITS; SCALAR CONSERVATION-LAWS; CONVECTION-DIFFUSION EQUATIONS; LIQUID-LIQUID DISPERSIONS; TRAFFIC FLOW; CONTINUOUS SEDIMENTATION; POLYDISPERSE SUSPENSIONS; DIFFERENCE SCHEME; OPERATING CHARTS; DIFFERENT SIZES	Multiphase flows of suspensions and emulsions are frequently approximated by spatially one-dimensional kinematic models, in which the velocity of each species of the disperse phase is an explicitly given function of the vector of concentrations of all species. The continuity equations for all species then form a system of conservation laws which describes spatial segregation and the creation of areas of different composition. This class of models also includes multi-class traffic flow, where vehicles belong to different classes according to their preferential velocities. Recently, these models were extended to fluxes that depend discontinuously on the spatial coordinate, which appear in clarifier-thickener models, in duct flows with abruptly varying cross-sectional area, and in traffic flow with variable road surface conditions. This paper presents a new family of numerical schemes for such kinematic flows with a discontinuous flux. It is shown how a very simple scheme for the scalar case, which is adapted to the "concentration times velocity" structure of the flux, can be extended to kinematic models with phase velocities that change sign, flows with two or more species (the system case), and discontinuous fluxes. In addition, a MUSCL-type upgrade in combination with a Runge-Kutta-type time discretization can be devised to attain second-order accuracy. It is proved that two particular schemes within the family, which apply to systems of conservation laws, preserve an invariant region of admissible concentration vectors, provided that all velocities have the same sign. Moreover, for the relevant case of a multiplicative flux discontinuity and a constant maximum density, it is proved that one scalar version converges to a BV (t) entropy solution of the model. In the latter case, the compactness proof involves a novel uniform but local estimate of the spatial total variation of the approximate solutions. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of all variants within the new family of schemes, including applications to problems of sedimentation, traffic flow, and the settling of oil-in-water emulsions.

The model is a 2 x 2 system of hyperbolic conservation laws, or, when the model includes a relaxation term, a 2 x 2 system of hyperbolic balance laws. The main difficulty is the presence of vacuum, which makes control of the total variation of the conservative variables impossible. We allow vacuum to appear and prove the existence of a weak entropy solution to the Cauchy problem.

J	Tiwari, G; Fazio, J; Gaurav, S; Chatteerjee, N				Tiwari, Geetam; Fazio, Joseph; Gaurav, Sushant; Chatteerjee, Niladri			Continuity equation validation for nonhomogeneous traffic	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING-ASCE			English	Article								The continuity equation involving traffic flow expresses the relationship between density, flow, and speed. Density equals the flow divided by space mean speed. The formulation of this equation in the year 1952 has two important assumptions. One assumption is that spacing and speed are constant, i.e., uncongested conditions with moderate to slightly high volumes. The other assumption is that homogeneous traffic prevails, vehicle composition is uniform and vehicles behave within strict lane discipline rules. To determine if the continuity equation is valid under nonhomogeneous traffic conditions, one performs an experiment involving data collection of density, flow, and speed at three midblock sites in India. Data collection occurred when uncongested conditions prevailed with moderate to slightly high volumes. Comparing the average density derived from observed densities in the field to the density derived from the continuity equation reveals whether or not the continuity equation accurately predicts average density under nonhomogeneous traffic conditions. Similar traffic operating characteristics served as the basis for grouping vehicles into five traffic entity types. The association between average density based on observed densities of nonhomogeneous traffic and density derived from the continuity equation had a con-elation coefficient of +0.88 for light, four-wheeler type, +0.85 for heavy vehicle type, +0.90 for motorized, three-wheeler type, +0.83 for motorized, two-wheeler type, and +0.50 for nonmotorized, two- and three-wheeler type. Additionally, a nonparametric test, i.e., Wilcoxon signed-rank test, compared observed and derived densities. At a 95% confidence level, no significant difference existed between observed and derived densities of light four-wheeler type, heavy vehicle type, motorized two-wheeler type, nonmotorized two- and three-wheeler type, and between cumulative observed and cumulative derived density. Only in the case of the motorized three-wheeler type, the observed, and derived densities are significantly different. These moderate to strong correlations coupled with the results of the nonparametric test validate the application of the continuity equation when traffic is nonhomogeneous.

Difference schemes, entropy solutions, and speedup impulse for an inhomogeneous kinematic traffic flow model	NETWORKS AND HETEROGENEOUS MEDIA			English	Article						conservation law; discontinuous flux; traffic model; entropy condition; difference scheme; driver's ride impulse	SCALAR CONSERVATION-LAWS; NONOSCILLATORY NUMERICAL SCHEME; DISCONTINUOUS FLUX FUNCTION; CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; CONTINUOUS SEDIMENTATION; GODUNOVS METHOD; STRONG TRACES; CONVERGENCE; APPROXIMATIONS; EXISTENCE	The classical Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) kinematic traffic model is extended to a unidirectional road on which the maximum density a(x) represents road inhomogeneities, such as variable numbers of lanes, and is allowed to vary discontinuously. The car density phi = phi(x, t) is then determined by the following initial value problem for a scalar conservation law with a spatially discontinuous flux: phi t + (phi v(phi/a(x))(x) = 0, phi(x, 0) = phi(0)(x), x is an element of R, t is an element of (0, T), (x) where v(z) is the velocity function. We adapt to (*) a new notion of entropy solutions (Burger, Karlsen, and Towers [Submitted, 2007]), which involves a Kruzkov-type entropy inequality based on a specific flux connection (A, B), and which we interpret in terms of traffic flow. This concept is consistent with both the driver's ride impulse and the desire of drivers to speed up. We prove that entropy solutions of type (A, B) are unique. This solution concept also leads to simple, transparent, and unified convergence proofs for numerical schemes. Indeed, we adjust to (*) new variants of the Engquist-Osher (EO) scheme (Burger, Karlsen, and Towers [Submitted, 2007]), and of the Hilliges-Weidlich (HW) scheme analyzed by the authors [J. Engrg. Math., to appear]. It is proven that the EO and HW schemes and a related Godunov scheme converge to the unique entropy solution of type (A, B) of (*). For the Godunov version, this is the first rigorous convergence and well-posedness result, since no unnecessarily restrictive regularity assumptions are imposed on the solution. Numerical experiments for first-order schemes and formally second-order MUSCL/Runge-Kutta versions are presented.

Shao, D.-X. Koncy, Y.-C. Li, Shock reflection for general quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, Nonlinear Anal. 66 (1) (2007) 93-124]. In the present paper, we study the global structure instability of the self-similar Solution u = U(x/t) containing shocks, contact discontinuities, and at least one rarefaction wave of the initial-boundary Riemann problem for general n x n quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on the quarter plane {(t, x) vertical bar t >= 0, x >= 0}. We prove the nonexistence of global piecewise C-1 solution to a class of the mixed initial-boundary value problem for general n x n quasilinear hyperbolic systems of conservation laws on the quarter-plane {(t, x) vertical bar t >= 0, x >= 0}. Our result indicates that the kind of Riemann solution it = U(x/t) mentioned above is globally structurally unstable. As an application of our result, we consider the model proposed by Aw and Rascle [A. Aw, M. Rascle, Resurrection of "second order" models of traffic flow, SIAM J. Appl. Math. 60 (2000) 916-938] describing traffic flow on a, road network. Following the work of Garavello and Piccoli [M. Garavello, B. Piccoli, Traffic flow on a road network using the Aw-Rascle model, Comm. Partial Differential Equations 31 (2) (2006) 243-2751, we prove the nonexistence of global piecewise C-1 solution containing one rarefaction wave of the initial-boundary value problem for this model.

Michael			A polymorphic dynamic network loading model	COMPUTER-AIDED CIVIL AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING			English	Article							CELL TRANSMISSION MODEL; KINEMATIC WAVES; VARIATIONAL FORMULATION	A polymorphic dynamic network loading (PDNL) model is developed and discretized to integrate a variety of macroscopic traffic flow and node models. The polymorphism, realized through a general node-link interface and proper discretization, offers several prominent advantages. First of all, PDNL allows road facilities in the same network to be represented by different traffic flow models based on the tradeoff of efficiency and realism and/or the characteristics of the targeted problem. Second, new macroscopic link/node models can be easily plugged into the framework and compared against existing ones. Third, PDNL decouples links and nodes in network loading, and thus opens the door to parallel computing. Finally, PDNL keeps track of individual vehicular quanta of arbitrary size, which makes it possible to replicate analytical loading results as closely as desired. PDNL, thus, offers an ideal platform for studying both analytical dynamic traffic assignment problems of different kinds and macroscopic traffic simulation.

J	Liu, YG; You, ZS; Zhou, JL				Liu, Y. G.; You, Z. S.; Zhou, J. L.			Navier-Stokes-like equations applicable to adaptive cruise control traffic flows	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							DERIVATION; MODEL	Under the scenario in which, within a traffic flow, each vehicle is controlled by adaptive cruise control (ACC), and the macroscopic one-vehicle probability distribution function fits the Paveri-Fontana hypothesis, a set of reduced Paveri-Fontana equations considering the ACC effect is derived. With the set, by maximizing the specially defined informational entropy deviating from a certain reference homogeneous steady state, the Navier-Stokes-like equations considering ACC are introduced. For a homogeneous steady traffic flow in a single circular lane, when the steady velocity or density is perturbed along the lane, numerical simulations indicate that ACC-controlled vehicles require less time for re-equilibration than manually driven vehicles. The re-equilibrated steady densities for ACC and manually driven traffic flow are all close to the original values; the same is true for the re-equilibrated steady velocity for manually driven traffic flows. For ACC traffic flows, the re-equilibrated steady velocity may be higher or lower than the original value, depending upon a parameter omega (introduced to solve the distribution function of the reference steady state), and the headway time (introduced in ACC models). Also, the simulations indicate that only an appropriate parameter set can ensure the performance of ACC; otherwise, ACC may result in low traffic running efficiency, although traffic flow stability becomes better.

J	Stevanovic, AZ; Martin, PT				Stevanovic, Aleksandar Z.; Martin, Peter T.			Assessment of the suitability of microsimulation as a tool for the evaluation of macroscopically optimized traffic signal timings	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERING			English	Article								In practice, traffic signal timings are derived using macroscopic tools that are essentially deterministic. Traffic flows, signal phasing, and street geometry are processed to deliver optimized signal timings. Objective functions strive for efficiency through minimizing measures such as delay and journey time. We now have traffic microsimulation tools that model traffic by imitating its stochastic nature. This paper looks at microsimulation as a means of testing optimized signal timings. We assess the suitability of evaluating signal timings optimized macroscopically through microsimulation. We analyze a range of traffic demand and traffic control scenarios. A real-world arterial with 12 signalized intersections serves as a test bed for the experiments. The results show that when macroscopically optimized signal timings are subject to extensive evaluation through microsimulation, their efficiency is shown to be inconsistent. The paper concludes that the traffic microsimulation tools cannot always be relied upon to evaluate macroscopically optimized traffic signal timings because these timings sometimes perform worse, in microsimulation, than the nonoptimized signal timings.

Compared with highway traffic, urban freeway traffic has different characteristics, such as denser on- and off-ramps, more complex road conditions, and lower velocity limits. Until now, however, there has been no comprehensive analysis of urban traffic flow. In this paper, through an analysis of the density dependence of velocity distribution, we investigate the fundamental velocity-density relationships of urban freeways, compare them with those of highway traffic, and explain them using existing traffic flow theories.

The traffic density control problem is first formulated into an output tracking and disturbance rejection problem. Through rigorous analysis, it is shown that the iterative learning control method can effectively deal with this class of control problem and greatly improve the traffic response. Next, the iterative learning control is combined with error feedback in a complementary modular manner to achieve the output tracking and system robustness. The effectiveness of the new approach is further verified through case studies with intensive simulations. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Ngoduy, D				Ngoduy, D.			Applicable filtering framework for online multiclass freeway network estimation	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						macroscopic model; unscented kalman filter; unscented particle filter; multiclass traffic estimation	TRAFFIC STATES; MODEL; SIMULATION; WAVES; FLOW	Real-time traffic flow estimation is important for online traffic control and management. The traffic state estimator optimally matches traffic measurements from detectors with traffic flow predictions from a dynamic traffic model under a certain control strategy. The current and widely used estimator is based on the Extended Kalman Filter algorithm (EKF). Basically, EKF is developed from the recursive Bayesian estimation technique for Gaussian random distribution of the state. This approximation may result in large errors in the estimation and even lead to divergence of the filter in highly non-linear dynamic system such as heterogeneous traffic flow operations. The aims of this paper are therefore twofold. On the one hand, we present a generalized stochastic macroscopic traffic model for multiclass freeway networks. The model is developed in the form that can be applied by filtering methods. On the other hand, we implement an accurate probabilistic framework to the real-time multiclass freeway network estimation. The framework uses a variation of Kalman Filter, namely Unscented Kalman Filter, and a different filter that is based on a sequential Monte Carlo method, namely Unscented Particle Filter. We investigate the performance of the proposed framework with respect to accuracy and computational effort using real-life data collected in a freeway network in England. We expect that the developed tool is useful for traffic operators and planners in controlling large-scale multiclass freeway networks. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better understand networking and security aspects of VANETs, we have been investigating network connectivity issues and mappings of car networks to the underlying road topology. Using this mapping and various metrics, we locate hot-spots in vehicular networks to determine the most vulnerable points for jamming. We also use these to optimize the placement of roadside units. To this end, we first develop quantitative measures for assessment of the importance of road segments in the context of security and traffic flow. We then use game theoretic analysis to investigate the effects of possible malicious users on the system for increased reliability and better management of resources. For example, we study the optimal deployment of traffic control and security infrastructure both in the static (roadside units) and dynamic case (law enforcement units). We use realistic simulation data, obtained from traffic scientists, as input to our models as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of countermeasures.

Guaranteed bounds for traffic flow parameters estimation using mixed Lagrangian-Eul\erian sensing	2008 46TH ANNUAL ALLERTON CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION, CONTROL, AND COMPUTING, VOLS 1-3	Annual Allerton Conference on Communication Control and Computing		English	Proceedings Paper	46th Annual Allerton Conference on Communication, Control and Computing	SEP, 2008	Monticello, IL				HAMILTON-JACOBI EQUATIONS; VISCOSITY SOLUTIONS; CONSERVATION-LAWS; KINEMATIC WAVES; FORMULATION	This article proposes a new method combining convex optimization and viability theory for estimating traffic flow conditions on highway segments. Traffic flow is modeled by a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Using a Lax-Hopf formula, we formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for a mixed boundary and internal conditions problem to be well posed. The well-posedness conditions result in a system of linear inequalities, which enables us to compute upper and lower bounds on traffic flow parameters as the solution to a linear program. We illustrate the capabilities of the method with a data assimilation problem for the estimation of the travel time function using Eulerian and Lagrangian measurements generated from Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) traffic data.

Traffic Signal Control Based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference	2008 4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND AUTOMATION FOR SUSTAINABILITY (ICIAFS)			English	Proceedings Paper	4th International Conference on Information and Automation for Sustainability	DEC 12-14, 2008	Colombo, SRI LANKA	IEEE			LOGIC CONTROLLER	An adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system is developed and tested for traffic signal controlling. From a given input data set, the developed adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system can draw the membership functions and corresponding rules by its own, thus making the designing process easier and reliable compared to standard fuzzy, logic controllers. Among useful inputs of fuzzy signal control systems, gap between two vehicles, delay at intersections vehicle density, flow rate and queue length are often used. By considering the practical applicability, the average vehicle inflow rate of each lane is considered in this work as inputs to model the adaptive neuro-fuzzy signal control system. In order to define the desired objectives of reducing the waiting time of vehicles at the signal control, the combined delay of vehicles within one signal cycle is minimized using a simple mathematical optimization method The performance of the control system was tested further by developing an event driven traffic simulation program in Matlab under Windows environment. As expected, the neuro-fuzzy logic controller performed better than the fixed time controller due to its real time adaptability. The neuro-fuzzy controlling system allows more vehicles to pass the junction in congestion and less number of vehicles when the flow, rate is low. In particular, the performance of the developed system was superior when there were abrupt changes in traffic flow rates. This is especially very much useful for Sri Lankan roads due to increasing frequency of sudden changes in traffic patterns caused by closure of roads for short time intervals to accommodate security issues.

Based on analyzing the demand of intelligent transportation system and the problems of the exiting recognition methods, the intelligent rapid recognition method of chaos in traffic flow was proposed. The principle and the structure of the system are briefly introduced. There are online recognition subsystem and offline recognition subsystem mainly. Normal methods are used in the offline recognition model. The online recognition model was established by using SVM rough neural network, which the wavelet packet energy features vector of the anterior time series of traffic flow in every training samples were used as input variables. The SVM rough neural network consist of three parts which generated by two hyperplanes that partiton the universe. Rough neurons lie in the hidden layer and the hyperplanes are obtained by a method that is similar to SVM. The simulation result shows its correctness. And it can satisfy the real-time requirement of chaos recognition.

This approach is suitable for distributed parameter systems in order to reformulate their partial differential equation description as sets of transfer functions. The model used in our work is the macroscopic continuous Lighthill-Whitham-Richards representation. The physical phenomena characteristic for the vehicular flow on a highway section are analyzed over some important length. This implies the description of the traffic as a distributed parameter plant. We present the Green function transformation's general case and after we apply it to the considered traffic flow model in order to obtain its transfer function form. The sets of expressions obtained can be specified using concrete fundamental diagrams and data, and also can be implemented in the design of control strategies.

We uses wireless sensor network (WSN) to decrease vehicles' average trip waiting time (ATWT) on the road. We studied the performance of using one sensor and two sensors and designed corresponding controllers. In the case of one sensor we developed two models; a non-occupancy detection (NOD) and an occupancy detection (OD). NOD detects passing vehicles only whereas, OD detects vehicles that pass the sensor or stop at it. In both methods, we changed the sensor location relative to the traffic light's location. We then used two sensors to calculate number of vehicles waiting or approaching a traffic light. We tested different distances between these two sensors. Two sensors-based controller outperform the one sensor controller and produced results comparable to the ideal control that knows exact number of waiting vehicles. In analyzing our simulation, we found that the distance between the two sensors does not affect the performance of our design. Hence, placing both the sensors close to each others produce the best performance in terms of quality of the data and reduce energy consumption which leads to extending the life time of the WSN.

The AFC is composed of the signal control system-oriented control level and the signal controller-oriented fuzzy rules regulation level. The control level decides the signal timings in an intersection by a fuzzy logic controller. The regulation level optimizes the fuzzy rules by the adaptive module in AFC according to both the system performance index in current control period and the traffic flows in the last one. Consequently the system performances are improved. A weight coefficient controller (WCC) is developed to describe the interactions of traffic flow between the adjacent intersections. So the AFC combined with the WCC can be applied in a road network. Evaluation of the performance on a real traffic scenario has been conducted. Simulation results indicate that the adaptive controller for traffic control shows better performance than the actuated one.

The macroscopic model to describe the evolution of freeway traffic flow is first established. The algorithm of the composition controller of PID and CMAC is then studied. There are two control layers in this control architecture: the coordinated control layer is responsible for computing the desired state of each segment, and the direct control layer is in charge of the ramp metering rate via the composition controller of PID and CMAC. Finally, the control system is simulated in MATLAB software and fuzzy logic control is also chosen in contrast to the composition control. The result shows that the composition controller improves evidently on the aspects of response speed and dynamic performance. This method can effectively eliminate traffic jams, and can make vehicles travel more efficiently and safely.

The support vector regression (SVR) method is employed for traffic flow forecasting and the comparative results between SVR and BP model using real traffic data of SCOOT system in Dalian city is also presented in this paper. Since support vector machines have better generalization performance and can guarantee global minima for given training data, it is believed that SVR Will perform well for real-time traffic flow forecasting. However, the good generalization performance of SVR highly depends on good parameter selection (PS). This paper describes simple yet practical approach to SVR parameter selection directly from the training data. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate the feasibility of applying SVR to traffic flow forecasting and prove that the SVR's parameter selection can better satisfy real-time demand of traffic flow forecasting and has good practicability.

The freeway network with multi-origin and multi-destination was modeled using a second order macroscopic traffic flow model. The nonlinear optimization method for traffic control was presented. The considered control measure was route diversion by Variable Message Signs (VMS). The control task was formulated as a dynamic, nonlinear, discrete-time optimal control problem with constrained control variables. Considering the characteristic of nonlinearity of this control problem, a gradient algorithm, which was imbedded by a Quasi-Newton search algorithm, was presented.

While the classical speed density relationships provide useful insight into the traffic dynamics problem and have a theoretical value to traffic flow, for such applications they are limited. This paper focuses on calibrating parameters for speed-density relationships with machine learning methods, and introduces a new algorithm called "clustering-locally weighted regression". In order to improve the precision of parametric calibration, we also preprocess sensor data, including finding missing sensor data, detecting error data, and repairing both of them. Finally, so as to fuse more information into the process of calibration, this paper utilizes densities and flows as variables to calibrate parameters for the speed-density relationships. The proposed approaches are tested with sensor data from the 3(rd) ring road in Beijing.

On the one hand we try to find the maximum possible increase in traffic demand by setting traffic signals at individual intersections. On the other hand, we increase the road capacity in order to increase the whole capacity of a road network. In view of the characteristic of mixed traffic flow in road network, we proposed a multimodal bi-level programming model which fully considered the interaction of different vehicle classes and influence upon the network reserve capacity by budget. The proposed model was solved by a solution algorithm based on extremum disturbed and simplified Particle Swarm Optimization (dsPSO). Numerical experiment results show that capacity of O-D pairs are in direct ratio with the total available budget, only if O-D demand multiplier of all vehicle classes tend to be about equal the benefit of all users can be guaranteed, and the convergence performance of dsPSO in dealing with the traffic model is good after disturbance factors were introduced into PSO.

The charge-depletion mode is more appropriate for the power management of PHEV, Le. the state of charge (SOC) is expected to drop to a low threshold when the vehicle reaches the destination of the trip. Global optimization charge-depletion power management would be desirable. However, this has so far been hampered due the a priori nature of the trip information and the almost prohibitive computational cost of global optimization techniques such as dynamic programming (DP). This situation can be changed by the current advancement of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) based on the use of on-board GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling techniques. In this paper, gas-kinetic base trip modeling approach was used for the highway portion trip and for the local road portion the traffic light sequences throughout the trip will be synchronized with the vehicle operation. Several trip models approaches were studied for a specific case. The simulation results demonstrated significant improvement in fuel economy using DP based charge-depletion control compared to rule based control. The gas-kinetic based trip model for the highway portion can describe the dynamics of the traffic flow on highway with on/off ramps which may be missed by the model which used only the main road detectors data.

Based on NS models of traffic flow, the relative velocity among vehicles is taken into account. And the renewal rules of NS model are revised. It is mainly to raise the driving speed by correlating stochastic probability of speed-down with velocity. Mixed traffic flows with two-different-maximurn-speed and three-different-maximum-speed are acted examples to be simulated. On the basic of the result of simulation, the velocity of mixed traffic flows is up to the velocity of slow vehicles. So for improving the velocity of high-speed roads, the limitation of the lowermost velocity is needed to be raised. The traffic capacity of high-speed roads also can be increased.

However, the configurations of VSLS will directly or indirectly affect drivers' recognition to VSLS systems and then influence their driving behavior. Since bus passenger occupancy is much higher than that of a small passenger car, a bus accident often causes high fatality and injury rate. Thus, this study integrates a bus driving simulator and the faceLAB system to conduct a driving simulation and analyzes visual and operational impacts of VSLS configurations on bus drivers on freeways. Results show that glance frequency, glance duration and perception reaction time (PRT) are influenced by VSLS configurations. In addition, glance duration and PRT on curved roadside VSLS are significantly higher than those on overhead VSLS. The overhead VSLS is the most effective system for bus drivers to react and slow down.

The capability to forecast traffic flow has been identified as a critical need for dynamic traffic control system. The embedding phase-space theory treats the dynamic evolution of traffic flow as a chaos time series, and this provides the possibility to forecast short-term traffic flow accurately. The theory of blind signal processing is widely used in the area of data mining. Practical historic traffic flow can be regarded as a blind signal mixed of real traffic flow and noise introduced by measurement tools. Blind signal separation is a good method to reduce noise and abstract principal components of historic traffic flow series. This paper proposes an approach based on embedding phase-space and blind signal separation, which enables us to realize the de-nosing and forecasting of the traffic flow synchronously, with another advantage of self-adaptive characteristic.

The transportation capacity could be even doubled when DDES runs in a pure up-peak traffic pattern where two connected cages stop at every two floors in an elevator round trip. However, the specific features of DDES make the elevator system intractable when it runs in some other traffic patterns. Moreover, since almost all of the traffic flows vary continuously during a day, an optimized controller of DDES is required to adapt the varying traffic flow. In this paper, we have proposed a controller adaptive to traffic flows for DDES using Genetic Network Programming (GNP) based on our past studies in this field, where the effectiveness of DDES controller using GNP has been verified in three typical traffic patterns. A traffic flow judgment part was introduced into the GNP framework of DDES controller, and the different parts of GNP were expected to be functionally localized by the evolutionary process to make the appropriate cage assignment in different traffic flow patterns. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional approach and two heuristic approaches in a varying traffic flow during the work time of a typical office building.

But along with the economic developments, the intense competition of drivers and bicyclists for right of way brings significant trouble to city traffic. This paper studies the driving and riding behaviors during intrusion conflicts in vehicles-bicycles laminar flow, which means that some bicyclists will intrude the lanes reserved for vehicles from time to time. A cellular automata model is proposed to model such conflicts and examine the variation process of traffic flow rate according to the density of vehicles and bicycles. A useful suggestion is made in this paper finally, which will be further applied in infrastructure planning.

To enhance traffic safety and increase lane capacities, vehicles can be organized into platoons with the objective of maximizing the travel distance that platoons stay intact and then apply lane assignment to these platoons. The goal of this research is to form a distributed control strategy to select lanes for platoons using inter-vehicle communication. We evaluate the current platoon lane assignment strategy and compare its improvement over average vehicle travel time with the lane assignment for single vehicles reported in our previous work [1]. Simulation results show that while cooperate control for single vehicle lane assignment does lead to decreased vehicle travel times, the implementation of cooperative lane assignment for platooning vehicles leads to an even greater reduction.

A reduction of dangerous situations and a higher level of traffic flow can be achieved only partially if single vehicles are considered. Controlling a cluster of cognitive vehicles has more potential for improvement if they are acting in a similar way, e.g. driving at the same time on a motorway in the same direction or approaching a junction. This cluster is called a cooperative group, and acts with sensors to perceive the environment, actuators to influence the maneuver of the vehicles and car-to-car-communication to exchange relevant information between the vehicles. In this paper we will describe a distributed algorithm for the life cycle management of these cooperative groups and introduce a common relevant picture as basis for situation recognition and decision making in a complex traffic scenario. Another focus of this contribution is the microscopic simulation framework developed within the project. It incorporates an agent based component realizing the life cycle management of cooperative groups.

A new approach for real-time traffic management under emergency evacuation is proposed in this paper. Distinct from the well-studied evacuation planning, real-time traffic management for evacuation aims at dynamically controlling traffic flow under evacuation in such a way that certain system objective like minimization of evacuation time could be achieved. The proposed approach is based on dynamic traffic assignment by considering the traffic network under evacuation as a dynamic system. First, the dynamic system optimal traffic assignment model based on the shortest emergency evacuation time is established. Second, the optimal solution to the optimal problem is obtained by using Pontryagin minimum principle. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate that the proposed approach can be effectively carried out in emergency evacuation.

And traffic system is a complex system. Velocity, flow and density are considered as subsystems of the whole traffic system. The research object is the highway traffic system. The qualitative analysis of traffic system is given on the basis of catastrophe theory. And the quantitative analysis of traffic system is given based on the cusp catastrophe mode. The relative results are also got. The results of analysis are conformed to the reality. The brittleness analysis of traffic system is given by combining the result of the quantitative analysis with complex system brittleness theory. Thereby the policy and measure of traffic control must be done when the observed density of practical traffic flow is nearby the critical density.

Then, we investigate the typical traffic induced by a car accident on the left lane under the open boundary. We carry out the simulation to observe the evolution of traffic jam. The simulation results suggest that traffic jams are extended upstream from the stopped car and the two-lane MVD model can suppress the traffic jam effectively.

Using a realistic microscopic model to represent the vehicular traffic flow, we investigate the performance of the above broadcast algorithm classes by simulation. In order to explore a very large algorithmic design space, we devise a Convex Hull framework that allows us to effectively compare and compactly present the boundaries of the solution space for each algorithm class. By the use of such framework we show that the beaconing approach is not justified for broadcast in suburban and highway VANETs, as there is no performance gain that justifies the complexity entailed by the beaconing procedure.

The intelligent vehicles can communicate with each other and with the roadside infrastructure. The vehicles are organized in platoons with short intraplatoon distances, and larger distances between platoons. Moreover, all vehicles are assumed to be automated, i.e., throttle, braking, and steering commands are determined by an automated on-board controller. In this paper we first propose a model predictive control (MPC) approach to determine appropriate speeds for the platoons. Next, we discuss which prediction models are suited to be used as an on-line traffic prediction model in MPC for IVHS. The proposed approach is then applied to a simple simulation example in which the aim is to minimize the total time all vehicles spend in the network by optimally assigning speeds to the platoons.

The proposed model was solved by a solution algorithm based on extremum disturbed and simplified Particle Swarm Optimization (dsPSO). Numerical experiment results show that capacity of Origin-Destination(O-D) pairs are in direct ratio with green time proportion of signal-controlled intersections, not all vehicle classes' traffic flow increase or decrease with O-D total flows, if we pursue the maximum reserve capacity of network all the time, it will damage users' profitability on some O-D pairs, if setting a minimum O-D demand multiplier properly it can be avoided. The results indicate that multimodal reserve capacity model can veritably reflect the characteristic of network mixed traffic flow, and that dsPSO is effective, efficient and robust in dealing with the nonlinear constrained bi-level optimization problem.

Traffic signal systems that react to changing traffic conditions are an important component for improving transportation efficiency. The dynamic behavior of a group of traffic signals controlling a network of intersections is a complex discrete event system that can be modeled using Petri nets. In this paper, one purpose is to design a mechanism based on Petri nets with time interval associated to places to extend the green time to a main road depending on the demand of non-priority roads. Another objective is to try to allow green phases for a sequence of intersections in a small network in order to improve traffic flow for a platoon of vehicles. Modular characteristics of Petri nets are used to address complexity and design models in increasing levels of detail.

We have recently developed a two-scale dynamic programming approach as a nearly globally optimized charge-depletion strategy for the PHEV power management, through the combination with the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). The trip models are obtained via GPS, GIS, real-time and historical traffic flow data and advanced traffic flow modeling. A computationally efficient algorithm is proposed in this paper to enhance the previously developed two-scale DP framework so that the computational efficiency meets the need of on-board implementation. The electric-vehicle mode is reinforced for predicted traffic stops. For the remainder of the trip, the route is divided into a number of segments of certain length. For each segment, the fuel consumption and SOC change are calculated in advance according to different level of power splitting ratio, speed and acceleration/deceleration. The optimization can then be solved in spatial domain, with much less dimension than that in time domain. Simulation study showed significant reduction of computational time with minor loss of fuel economy performance.

How to improve the traffic flow forecasting precision is a crucial problem. Traffic models in different time sections have great differences. The forecasting precision could be improved if the traffic flow forecasting models were built on different time sections respectively. Traffic flow forecasting usually is real-time and too many forecasting variables will reduce the real-time performance. So the selection of the most informative forecasting variable combination is significant. It can save computation cost and improve forecasting precision. In this paper, information bottleneck theory based on extended entropy is used to partition traffic flow of a day into different time sections. Corresponding to each time section, feature selection based on mutual information is generalized to regression problems and is used to select the most informative variable combination. Selected variables are input to Support Vector Machines (SVM) for traffic flow forecasting. Bayesian inference is used to determine the kernel parameters of SVM. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through analyzing the traffic data of Jinan urban transportation.

While the classical speed-density relationships provide a useful insight into the traffic dynamics problem and have theoretical value to traffic flow, for such applications they are limited. This paper focuses on calibrating parameters for the speed-density relationships by using data mining methods such as locally weighted regression, k-means, k-nearest neighborhood classification and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Meanwhile, in order to improve the precision of the parametric calibration, we also utilize densities and flows as variables to calibrate parameters. The proposed approach is tested with sensor data from the 3(rd) ring road in Beijing. The test results how that the proposed algorithm has great performance on the parametric calibration of the speed-density relationships.

Original image analysis methods are then required to process challenging 2D or 3D image sequences. To address the tracking problem of several hundreds of objects, we propose an original framework that provides general information about vesicle transport, that is traffic flows between origin and destination regions detected in the image sequence. Traffic estimation can be accomplished by adapting the advances in Network Tomography commonly used in network communications. In this paper, we address image partition given vesicle stocking areas and multipaths routing for vesicle transport. This approach has been developed for real fluorescence image sequences and Rab proteins.

The generation of GMTI tracks from these data is the backbone for target identification, ground surveillance as well as traffic flow analysis. The generation of precise and continuous tracks from GMTI radar plots often is a demanding task due to terrain and technical obscuration and clutter. The exploitation of non-standard background information such as road maps and terrain information is therefore highly desirable for the enhancement of track quality and track continuity. The present paper presents a Bayesian tracking scheme that incorporates digital road-map information and a model for the clutter notch of the GMTI sensor. The significant gain in track quality and track continuity is demonstrated in a number of simulation scenarios involving Doppler blindness and terrain obscuration.

Based on analyzing the demand of intelligent transportation system and the problems of the exiting recognition methods of chaos in traffic flow, the intelligent recognition method of chaos was proposed. The principle and the structure of the system are briefly introduced. There are online recognition subsystem and offline recognition subsystem mainly. Normal methods are used in the offline recognition model. The online recognition model was established by using rough set neural network, which the wavelet packet energy features vector of the anterior time series of traffic flow were used as original features vector. The recognizing rules and the reduced features vector of the chaos were acquired by using rough set theory. The reduced features vector was used as the input variables of the online recognition neural network model. The simulation result shows its correctness.

Vision-based analysis of pedestrian traffic data	2008 INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON CONTENT-BASED MULTIMEDIA INDEXING	International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing		English	Proceedings Paper	International Workshop on Content-Based Multimedia Indexing	JUN 18-20, 2008	London, ENGLAND					Reducing traffic congestion has become a major issue within urban environments. Traditional approaches, such as increasing road sizes, may prove impossible in certain scenarios, such as city centres, or ineffectual if current predictions of large growth in world traffic volumes hold true. An alternative approach lies with increasing the management efficiency of pre-existing infrastructure and public transport systems through the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this paper, we focus on the requirement of obtaining robust pedestrian traffic flow data within these areas. We propose the use of a flexible and robust stereo-vision pedestrian detection and tracking approach as a basis for obtaining this information. Given this framework, we propose the use of a pedestrian indexing scheme and a suite of tools, which facilitates the declaration of user-defined pedestrian events or requests for specific statistical traffic: flow data. The detection of the required events or the constant flow of statistical information can be incorporated into a variety of ITS solutions for applications in traffic management, public transport systems and urban planning.

Traditionally, time series model is based on the Back Propagation (BP) neural network, but BP neural network is a kind of static neural network, which is only the implementation of static non-linear one-to-one corresponding mapping, not suitable for real-time identification of dynamic system. It is difficult to forecast the traffic flow changes accurately. On the basis of analyzing dynamic traffic flow in urban road tunnel, this paper puts forward the dynamic neural network model of the traffic flow forecasting in urban road tunnel, which is-based on the Elman network with functions of the state memory. Time series model established by Elman network includes autoregressive part as well as moving average part, or rather, an autoregressive moving average model. Output of the model depends not only on its "past and present input, but also on the output of the past. We adopt it to simulate and forecast the dynamic traffic flow of Wuhan Shou Yi Square road tunnel. The results of field test indicate that the method can increase the velocity of convergence greatly and improve the forecast accuracy.

In order to evaluate traffic status of community scientifically, the concept of traffic saturation is presented. Based on the relationship between the using rate of means of transportation for community and local traffic flow, a model of traffic capacity is developed. The model can describe the dynamic relationship between means of transportation and traffic capacity, which provides directions on transportation programming for community. Furthermore, some easing strategies of traffic capacity are presented. The feasibility of these strategies is analyzed by the present model.

Time-varying characteristics of traffic flows are analyzed to evaluate the volume balance at each signalized intersection during the cycle length for each lane. The signal control system of the congestion length is described by a nonlinear time-varying discrete dynamic system and synthesized by using the feedback control based on the volume balance at each signalized intersection. The signal control algorithm in which the three signal control parameters are searched systematically so as to minimize the sum of congestion lengths along the arterials is presented.

The response of lifeline systems, like gas and water networks, during a strong earthquake, can be conveniently evaluated with the estimated average number of ruptures per kin of pipe. These ruptures may be caused either by fault ruptures crossing, or by permanent deformations of the soil mass (landslides, liquefaction), or by transient soil deformations caused by seismic wave propagation. The possible consequences of damaging earthquakes on transportation systems may be the reduction or the interruption of traffic flow, as well as the impact on the emergency response and on the recovery assistance. A critical element in the emergency management is the closure of roads due to fallen obstacles and debris of collapsed buildings. The earthquake-induced damage to buried pipes is expressed in terms of repair rate (RR), defined as the number of repairs divided by the pipe length (km) exposed to a particular level of seismic demand; this number is a function of the pipe material (and joint type), of the pipe diameter and of the ground shaking level, measured in terms of peak horizontal ground velocity (PGV) or permanent ground displacement (PGD). The development of damage algorithms for buried pipelines is primarily based on empirical evidence, tempered with engineering judgment and sometimes by analytical formulations. For the city of Catania, in the present work use has been made of the correlation between RR and peak horizontal ground velocity by American Lifelines Alliance (ALA, 2001), for the verifications of main buried pipelines. The performance of the main buried distribution networks has been evaluated for the Level I earthquake scenario (January 11, 1693 event I = XI, M 7.3) and for the Level 11 earthquake scenario (February 20, 1818 event I = IX, M 6.2). Seismic damage scenario of main gas pipelines and water has been obtained, with PGV values calculated for level I and level It earthquake scenarios.

We consider a city with five highly compact central business districts (CBD). The road network of the city is relatively dense and is considered as a continuum. The traffic demand from any destination in the city to the CBD is assumed to be a function of both the destination location and the total travel cost to the CBD. Each commuter is assumed to patronize a CBD to minimize individual total cost. The total cost depends on the location, the traffic flow intensity and a cost associated with the congestion externality at the CBD. The model is firstly formulated as a calculus of variations problem. Then finite element method and evolutionary structural optimization (ESO) is used to solve and optimize the model. Finally we find the initial location of future artery through solving the continuum user equilibrium problem. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

In order to improve time efficiency of prediction, a new short-term traffic flow prediction model and method based on accurate online support vector regression (AOSVR) is proposed in this paper, which can update the prediction function in real time via incremental learning way. A comparison of the performance of AOSVR with ANN, real time, and historic approach is carried out. Experiments results demonstrate that the AOSVR predictor can reduce significantly both relative mean errors and root meant squared errors of predicted travel times. Therefore, AOSVR based traffic flow prediction is applicable and performs well for traffic data analysis.

This goal, in respect of road transport, can be attained by encouraging public transport modes like buses by assigning priority. This paper is concerned with the conceptual framework of a micro simulation model of highly heterogeneous traffic flow and application of the model to study the impact of exclusive bus lanes introduced on urban arterials. The impact is measured in terms of the reduction in speed of other categories of motor vehicles, due to the consequent reduction in road space. The results of the study indicates that it is possible to introduce exclusive bus lanes on selected urban roads to enhance the level of service of the bus, without much adverse impact on the level of service of other modes of road transport.

The evolution of traffic on each edge of the network is modeled by a modified Lighthill-Whitham-Richards partial differential equation. We pose the problem of optimal traffic flow regulation as a continuous optimization program in which the partial differential equation appears in the constraints. The equation is transformed with a variable change which removes the nonlinearity in the control variables and enables us to use linear finite difference schemes to discretize the problem. Corresponding linear programming and quadratic programming based solutions to this convex optimization program yield a globally optimal solution. The technique is applied for a network scenario in the Oakland Air Route Traffic Control Center.

Demand actuated traffic signal settings or variable message signs are examples of traffic management devices driven by the dynamic characteristics of the traffic. In most cases however, these traffic management devices are implemented as stand-alone systems, meaning that there is no, or hardly any, co-ordination between the various traffic management measures taken. The lack of co-ordination carries within it the risk of reduced effectiveness. The various measures could, for example, serve opposing objectives or even generate a negative impact on traffic flows that or not in any way related to the problem that the traffic management device was meant to solve in the first place. The uncoordinated application of dynamic traffic management measures thus could possibly be counter-productive. The setbacks of uncoordinated control can be avoided by carrying out the control task in two different ways: in a detailed way by focusing on the problem(s) that need(s) to be solved (distributed control), and in a more generic way by controlling the overall traffic performance in the network (generic control). In this paper we analyse the possibility of combining both distributed and generic control in one control strategy using hierarchic agents. In effect the approach tries to match local and global impacts by using autonomous agents interacting with each other in a horizontal and in a vertical (hierarchical) way. The local agents (defined in terms of network links or network nodes) control the traffic in their specific area according to predefined performance goals. One layer higher in the hierarchy another agent controls the traffic performance in a part of the network, checking the results of individual control strategies against the overall performance goal of that specific part of the network. We present the results of a modelling experiment featuring a control system with two layers. The first layer consists of link agents directly serving the traveller by guaranteeing reliable travel times and/or maximal throughput. The second layer consists of node agents that try to harmonize conflicting goals of the various link agents. An important characteristic of our approach is that the higher level agent is dominant in the negotiation process (i.e. a higher weight is attached to the decision of the higher level agent). The multi-agent control strategy described above is applied to a test network consisting of a part of the road network around the city of Antwerp. The results show that it can easily deal with the goals of the various agents. In the case of conflicts, the attached control priority determines how differences will be settled. An interesting feature of the above approach is the lack of a central mechanism controlling the various agents. The global optimum that is established in the system is the result of selfish behaviour on the part of the various agents combined with some co-ordination based on pre-set priorities. Actually the system is finding this optimum in a self-organising way. This is a very interesting feature as it allows us to apply a large range of control strategies.

The designed system for decision assistance in case of traffic closing/opening/restriction uses the real recorded data on environmental and users' costs. Simultaneously, the traffic flows parameters are counted. The cost functions for environmental and users' cost related to the traffic flow parameters are adjusted, in different cases of congestion level and street network state.

The traffic flow assignment on the detailed modeled network and the assessment of total social cost for the entire network are the base to find the optimal solution for traffic closing/opening or restriction.

Although many factors impact safety of highway transportation, at-grade intersection spacing is by far one of the most important factors. In reality, many situations can lead to closely neighbored intersections which become major causes of traffic accidents. To improve safety, intersection spacing should guarantee that vehicles from upstream intersection can be stabilized before coming to the next intersection. Therefore, minimum intersection spacing should be satisfied. By exploring characteristics of traffic flows released from upstream intersection, the paper has put forward a study approach, which analyzes safety state of vehicles by examining speed index CSV (coefficient of speed variance). Using microscopic traffic simulation software TSIS (Traffic Software Integrated System), simulation models for the study have been built up and calibrated. Finally, based upon analysis of data from simulation, standards for minimum intersection spacing of highways are given.

J	Wang, XS; Abdel-Aty, M				Wang, Xuesong; Abdel-Aty, Mohamed			Modeling left-turn crash occurrence at signalized intersections by conflicting patterns	ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION			English	Article						signalized intersection; left-turn crashes; conflicting patterns; approach level model; negative binomial; generalized estimating equations	LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS	In order to better understand the underlying crash mechanisms, left-turn crashes occurring at 197 four-legged signalized intersections over 6 years were classified into nine patterns based on vehicle maneuvers and then were assigned to intersection approaches. Crash frequency of each pattern was modeled at the approach level by mainly using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) with the Negative Binomial as the link function to account for the correlation among the crash data. GEE with a binomial logit link function was also applied for patterns with fewer crashes. The Cumulative Residuals test shows that, for correlated left-turn crashes, GEE models usually outperformed basic Negative Binomial models. The estimation results show that there are obvious differences in the factors that cause the occurrence of different left-turn collision patterns. For example, for each pattern, the traffic flows to which the colliding vehicles belong are identified to be significant. The width of the crossing distance (represented by the number of through lanes on the opposing approach of the left-turning traffic) is associated with more left-turn traffic colliding with opposing through traffic (Pattern 5), but with less left-turning traffic colliding with near-side crossing through traffic (Pattern 8). The safety effectiveness of the left-turning signal is not consistent for different crash patterns; "protected" phasing is correlated with fewer Pattern 5 crashes, but with more Pattern 8 crashes. The study indicates that in order to develop efficient countermeasures for left-turn crashes and improve safety at signalized intersections, left-turn crashes should be considered in different patterns.

The problem exacerbates due to the peak time congestions, which adversely affect the traffic flow, and air quality. Several exceedances of certain primary pollutants have been observed during the peak periods in the country. Air quality in the vicinity of a governmental school was assessed in March 2006 for a period of two weeks using air pollution monitoring station which recorded continuously various pollutants' concentrations and meteorological variables in five minute intervals. The results show that during the weekdays, the measured pollutants emitted from the road traffic next to the selected school, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were always under the allowable limits for Kuwaiti air quality standards except for a single exceedance of NO2 concentration at morning hours. On the other hand, the values of non-methane hydrocarbon pollutants were found to be several times above the Kuwaiti air quality standards throughout the investigated period. The suspended particulates (PM10) concentrations have exceeded twice the limits of Kuwaiti air quality standards. A traffic counter was used to record the number of cars in the main road next to the school in fifteen minute intervals for ten days during the monitoring period for air quality. Statistical analysis was used in order to test whether there is any correlation between variations in the CO concentrations and the traffic frequency during working days' morning and afternoon periods. A relation was developed for predicting the necessary reduction in traffic based on the necessary reduction in CO concentrations.

After the Estonian re-independence in 1991, the increase of motorization has been fast and car usage has intensified. During the same period, the average age of cars has decreased and thanks to improvements in engine technology, the emissions per km have been reduced. The objective was to see how these factors have reflected in air quality. This paper also aim to present an analytical approach to estimate the air pollution levels in recent years, when air quality monitoring has not been conducted, and available traffic data are limited. Based on traffic counts in 25 points across the city the amounts of traffic were modelled for 680 street segments with CUBE software. As air quality is monitored it-regularly in Tartu, dispersion modelling was used to estimate pollution levels. Annual concentrations of exhaust particles (PMexhaust), particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in 1993, 2000 and 2006 were calculated with AEROPOL software. The traffic increase in the city centre of Tartu was especially rapid in the 1990s. In recent years, it has slowed due to congestion. Overall, traffic levels have increased more than 3 times since 1993. In residential areas, the increase is still rapid - up to 6 times from 1993 to 2006. However, the changes in air quality are less dramatic. Increases from 1993 to 2000 were followed by stable or slightly increasing pollution levels in recent years, especially in case of PMexhaust. The study showed that 2 factors, namely, increase of traffic and improvement of vehicles, have been compensating each other in the dynamics of air pollution.

Since a road gradient changes gradually in a sag section, a driver dose not notice it and therefore, a traffic congestion occurs. This paper describes the cellular automata simulation of the traffic flow through a sag section. The simulation is performed by the stochastic velocity model[4]. The results show that the effect of a sag zone to the traffic congestion becomes strong according to the increase of car density and that average velocity tends to decrease not at the sag section but at a little ahead point of sag section.

The method of self-connection makes it sensitive to the historical data and improves the ability to process dynamic information. The initial inputs of the context unit and all the weights of the model are optimized by Dissimilation Particle Swarm Optimization. The algorithm mutates the local optimum based on the judging of local or global optimal value, and helps it jump out local convergence, so as to solve the defects which the found value are local optimal value and fall into the problem of prematurity of traditional Particle Swarm Optimization. An example demonstrates that this algorithm is simple, efficient, and fast.

Multicommodity flows on road networks	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Aw-Rascle model; multicommodity flow models; traffic networks	TRAFFIC FLOW; 2ND-ORDER MODELS; SCHEMES	In this paper, we discuss the multicommodity flow for vehicular traffic on road networks. To model the traffic, we use the "Aw-Rascle" multiclass macroscopic model [3]. We describe a solution to the Riemann problem at junctions with a criterion of maximization of the total flux, taking into account the destination path of the vehicles. At such a junction, the actual distribution depends on the demands and the supplies on the incoming and outgoing roads, respectively. Furthermore, this new distribution scheme captures efficiently key merging characteristics of the traffic and in contrast to [M. Herty, S. Moutari and M. Rascle, Networks and Heterogeneous Media, 1, 275-294, 2006] leads to an easy computational model to solve approximately the homogenization problem described in [M. Herty, S. Moutari and M. Rascle, Networks and Heterogeneous Media, 1, 275-294, 20061, [M. Herty and M. Rascle, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 38(2), 595-616, 2006]. Furthermore, we deduce the equivalent distribution scheme for the LWR multiclass model in [M. Garavello and B. Piccoli, Commun. Math. Sci., 3, 261-283, 2005] and we compare the results with those obtained with the "Aw-Rascle" multiclass model for the same initial conditions.
